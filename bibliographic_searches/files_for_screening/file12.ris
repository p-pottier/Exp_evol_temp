TI  - Fish growth and degree-days II: selecting a base temperature for an among-population study
VL  - 71
IS  - 9
SP  - 1303-1311
AB  - The degree-day (DD) is a method of describing the thermal opportunity for growth and development and is becoming increasingly popular when comparing fish growth over large spatial scales (e. g., counter-gradient growth). Temperatures too cold to permit growth are excluded in the DD equation by incorporating a lower temperature threshold (T-o). However, there is no convention for choosing T-o, and unknown is the effect of an incorrect T-o on how growth is perceived. We simulate data to demonstrate how an incorrect T-o may lead to differences in temperature-corrected growth rates among populations. These differences increase with the error in T-o and the thermal range among simulated populations. We then show the same relationships in an analysis of length-at-age data from 81 walleye (Sander vitreus) populations in North America. Together, our results demonstrate that differences in temperature-corrected growth rates among populations can be a statistical artifact rather than a biological phenomenon, especially when populations are distributed over a large thermal gradient.

TI  - Using natural laboratories to study evolution to global warming: contrasting altitudinal, latitudinal, and urbanization gradients
VL  - 35
SP  - 10-19
AB  - Demonstrating the likelihood of evolution in response to global warming is important, yet challenging. We discuss how three spatial thermal gradients (latitudinal, altitudinal, and urbanization) can be used as natural laboratories to inform about the gradual thermal evolution of populations by applying a space-for-time substitution (SFTS) approach. We compare thermal variables and confounding non-thermal abiotic variables, methodological approaches and evolutionary aspects associated with each type of gradient. On the basis of an overview of recent insect studies, we show that a key assumption of SFTS, local thermal adaptation along these gradients, is often but not always met, requiring explicit validation. To increase realism when applying SFTS, we highlight the importance of integrating daily temperature fluctuations, multiple stressors and multiple interacting species. Finally, comparative studies, especially across gradient types, are important to provide more robust inferences of evolution under gradual global warming. Integrating these research directions will further strengthen the still underused, yet powerful SFTS approach to infer gradual evolution under global warming.

AB  - An in vitro evolution procedure was used to obtain RNA enzymes with a particular catalytic function. A population of 10(13) variants of the, Tetrahynena ribozyme, a group I ribozyme that catalyzes sequence-specific cleavage of RNA via a phosphoester transfer mechanism, was generated. This enzyme has a limited ability to cleave DNA under conditions of high temperature or high MgCl2 concentration, or both. A selection constraint was imposed on the population of ribozyme variants such that only those individuals that carried out DNA cleavage under physiologic conditions were amplified to produce "progeny" ribozymes. Mutations were introduced during amplification to maintain heterogeneity in the population. This process was repeated for ten successive generations, resulting in enhanced (100 times) DNA cleavage activity.

TI  - Modified PID controller for automatic generation control of multi-source interconnected power system using fitness dependent optimizer algorithm
VL  - 15
IS  - 11
AB  - In this paper, a modified form of the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller known as the Integral- Proportional Derivative (I-PD) controller is developed for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of the two-area multi-source Interconnected Power System (IPS). Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) algorithm is employed for the optimization of proposed controller with various performance criteria including Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Time multiplied Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral of Time multiplied Square Error (ITSE), and Integral Square Error (ISE). The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been assessed on a two-area network with individual source including gas, hydro and reheat thermal unit and then collectively with all three sources. Further, to validate the efficacy of the proposed FDO based PID and I-PD controllers, comprehensive comparative performance is carried and compared with other controllers including Differential Evolution based PID (DE-PID) controller and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) hybridized with Local Unimodal Sampling (LUS-PID) controller. The comparison of outcomes reveal that the proposed FDO based I-PD (FDO-I-PD) controller provides a significant improvement in respect of Overshoot (Osh), Settling time (Ts), and Undershoot (Ush). The robustness of an I-PD controller is also verified by varying parameter of the system and load variation.

TI  - Temperature and plant nutrient effects on the development, survival and reproduction of Cinara sp nov., an invasive pest of cypress trees in Africa
VL  - 92
IS  - 2
SP  - 147-156
AB  - Cinara sp. nov., previously identified as Cinara cupressi (Buckton) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is an important alien aphid pest of cypresses and junipers, and invaded Africa in the late 1980s. The work reported here was carried out as part of a larger programme aimed at the classical biological control of the aphid in Africa. Basic life history attributes including life table statistics of the aphid were quantified in order to facilitate the development of efficient aphid culturing methods and essential baseline information necessary for the culturing of potential parasitoid biological agents prior to selection for introduction to Africa. Developmental rates and fecundity were studied under four constant temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C). The effects of several plant nutrients (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) supplied at different dose levels on life history attributes of Cinara sp. nov. were also studied. Unlike most other aphids, the apterous morph of Cinara sp. nov. developed through only three instars, and the alate four instars. The aphid is highly aggregative and exploits a wide range of feeding sites from young green branches to woody stems. The developmental period of Cinara sp. nov. ranged from 9.3 days at 25 degrees C to 22.3 days at 10 degrees C and the developmental threshold was 0.61 degrees C. Reproduction was delayed, because of the longer duration of development, and nymph production decreased with decreasing temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase ranged between 0.117 at 25 degrees C and 0.060 at 10 degrees C. Aphid size increased significantly as temperature was lowered. Wing formation was not induced when apterae were reared for up to three generations at each constant temperature but continuous crowding in the supply cultures held at 21 degrees C resulted in a high number of alates being formed. No appreciable effects of the different plant nutrients, supplied either singly or in combination, on the duration of instars or overall survival could be detected.

TI  - Life-history plasticity in the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe: local adaptations and trade-offs
VL  - 75
IS  - 2
SP  - 173-185
AB  - Life-history theory predicts some cost to be associated with short development time, the most frequently assumed being small adult size. Alternatively, insects may increase developmental rates and grow fast to a larger size. Seasonal environments should select for phenotypic plasticity in growth and development, based on the need to complete development up to the diapausing stage before the onset of unfavourable season. Nevertheless, there must be some limit beyond which a compensation for a shorter development cannot be achieved. By comparing three geographically isolated populations of Lycaena hippothoe in common environments we show that in the Hungarian population development time seems to be traded off against size at maturity. This population is the only bivoltine one within this principally monovoltine species. Thus, realization of an additional generation per year, achieved through largely reduced development times, appears to carry the cost of substantially lower adult weights compared with other populations. In contrast, differences in development time in two monovoltine populations were not accompanied by a trade-off between development time and size. These results suggest that clear trade-offs are restricted to stressful situations, when compensation by an increase in growth rates is no longer feasible. We suggest the particularly short development time in the Hungarian population (facilitating a second generation), as well as the shorter development in an alpine (short vegetation period) compared with a western German population, to be adaptations to local climatic conditions.

VL  - 127

SP  - 219-227
AB  - Population dynamics and production of the calanoid copepod Paracalanus sp. were studied from November 1986 to November 1987 in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was perennial, with a large abundance peak in June/July and small peaks in September/October and November/December. During a year of investigation, 15 generations could be detected. For each generation, the mean population egg production rate and the mean daily midstage abundance from NIII to CV were determined to obtain a survival curve from egg to CV. The mortality was extremely high during the early life stages: on average only 7.1% of the eggs produced might survive into NIII. This high mortality might be caused by predation by sympatric omnivorous copepods, in addition to sinking loss of eggs from the water column. The biomass of Paracalanus sp. showed marked seasonal variations largely in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of each developmental stage increased exponentially with temperature up to 20 degrees C, above which the rate was constant. The annual integrated production rate was 734 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) or 5.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB  - Aquaculture produces more than 50% of fish for human consumption and, in spite of major improvements since the adoption of injectable vaccines in the 1990s, bacterial diseases still account for considerable losses, particularly in tropical and warm temperate species. Streptococcosis, caused predominantly by Streptococcus iniae and S. agalactiae, manifests as a generalised septicaemia and meningitis followed by rapid mortality. Vaccination against streptococcal infections is difficult as a result of multiple, poorly defined serotypes and consequent vaccine escape (reinfection of previously vaccinated animals). However, genomics applied to reverse vaccinology is providing novel insights into diversity among these aquatic pathogens and is identifying cross-serotype targets that may be exploited for new generation streptococcal vaccines for aquaculture.

TI  - Pre-adult development of Phytoseiulus persimilis on diets of Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus lintearius: implications for the biological control of Ulex europaeus
VL  - 47
IS  - 2
SP  - 133-145
AB  - Predation by the phytoseiid mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, is considered a major threat to the effectiveness of biological control of gorse, Ulex europaeus, using Tetranychus lintearius. To assess this threat and to determine if the impact of P. persimilis on T. lintearius populations is comparable to its impact on T. urticae populations, its development and predator : prey generation time ratios were assessed. The pre-adult mortality and development time of two populations of P. persimilis fed on two diets, T. urticae and T. lintearius, were determined at two temperatures, 14 and 24A degrees C. There were no significant differences in either mortality or development time between the two populations of P. persimilis at these temperatures. There is therefore no evidence that the two tested populations of P. persimilis are behaving as different strains. Similarly, diet had no significant effect on either mortality or development time at these temperatures. At 14A degrees C the mortality of P. persimilis was significantly higher and development was significantly longer than at 24A degrees C. Using pre-adult development as a surrogate for generation times, predator : prey generation time ratios were calculated between P. persimilis and both T. urticae and T. lintearius using data from this and other studies. The predator : prey generation time ratios between P. persimilis and T. lintearius were lower than those between P. persimilis and T. urticae. These results indicate that the impact of P. persimilis on T. lintearius populations is likely to be comparable to its impact on T. urticae populations. This provides further evidence that predation by P. persimilis is having a deleterious effect on T. lintearius populations and therefore reducing its effectiveness as a biological control agent for gorse.

AB  - Small-scale distributed power generation offers environmental benefits through the improvement of global energy efficiency, in addition to increasing the reliability of the power supply. In this study, the technical and economic viability of the implementation of micro-cogeneration technology in the manufacturing sector was studied in light of the Brazilian regulatory situation. The thermal efficiency potential for the manufacturing sector is introduced for further exploration by decision-makers. This study also investigated the behavior of micro-cogeneration in distributed generation through the Brazilian Energy Compensation System. The technical viability was studied by simulating a Brayton cycle with the operation parameters of a 100 kW micro-turbine. This simulation allowed an estimation of the avoided cost of natural gas compared to an industrial process without cogeneration. Rate projections were performed by linear regression during the system's depreciation period. The economic evaluation was performed using the following indicators: net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and discounted payback. Finally, a sensitivity study was performed to project how the micro-cogeneration efficiency and the Brazilian regulations can address future variations of natural gas and electricity rates. Given the conditions of this study, the increase in energy prices favors micro-cogeneration; however, the economic viability is affected if the system operates below 70% of heat use in industrial processes, which reduces the effect of public policies toward the incentive to cogenerate.

AB  - The inheritance of heat-stable resistance to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, was studied in crosses between different accessions and clones of Lycopersicon peruvianum L. F1, F2 and BC1 generations were evaluated for their index of resistance based on numbers of eggs and infective second-stage juveniles (J2) per gram of root, and the segregation ratios were determined in experiments carried out at constant soil temperatures of 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. L. peruvianum P.I. 270435 clones 3 MH and 2 R2 and P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH, all heat-stable resistant, were crossed with L. peruvianum P.I. 126440 clone 9 MH, which is susceptible at both 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. All F1 progeny were resistant at 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C; F2 and BC1 generations at 25-degrees-C gave resistant: susceptible (R:S) ratios of 15:1 and 3:1, respectively, which suggests that resistance is conditioned by two independently assorting genes. However, at 30-degrees-C, R:S ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 were observed for the F2 and BC1 generations, respectively. These results indicate that heat-stable resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene expressed at 30-degrees-C, while the second resistance gene is heat unstable and not expressed at 30-degrees-C. P.I. 270435 clones 2 R2 and 3 MH and P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH were crossed with P.I. 128657 clone 3 R4 (source of gene Mi), which is resistant at 25-degrees-C but susceptible at 30-degrees-C. All of the F1 progeny were resistant at 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. TC1 progeny of 270435-2 R2 x 128657-3 R4, 270435-3 MH x 128657-3R4 and 126443-1 MH x 128657-3 R4 crossed with susceptible 126440-9 MH were all resistant at 25-degrees-C and segregated in a 1:1 ratio at 30-degrees-C. These results also suggest that the heat-stable resistance is monogenic and that it is non-allelic to gene Mi. The non-segregation of TC1 progenies at 25-degrees-C, suggests that the heat-unstable resistance factor in L. peruvianum P.I. 270435 clones 2 R2 and 3 MH and in P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH is allelic to or the same as gene Mi. We propose the symbol Mi-2 for the gene in P.I. 270435 that confers heat-stable resistance to M. incognita.

VL  - 13

SP  - 133-138
AB  - The effects of salinity on the growth rate and survival of juvenile Littorina scabra gastropods reared in the laboratory from the young of young females collected in estuarine, intermediate, and marine habitats were studied. The optimum growth conditions of juveniles were dependent on the salinity regime in their original habitat. The young group of females from the marine site showed maximum survival at a salinity of 40 parts per thousand, the value corresponding to the normal salinity in their native habitat during the breeding period, while at 30 parts per thousand, the growth of juveniles from this population was strongly suppressed. Juveniles originating from the estuarine habitat were able to maintain equally high growth rates at 40 and 30 parts per thousand; however, at 30 parts per thousand, they grew significantly faster than juveniles from the marine site. The progeny of females from the intermediate habitat showed intermediate growth rates at 30 parts per thousand. Fluctuating salinity (40-10-40 parts per thousand) had an adverse effect on the growth of juvenile Littorina, irrespective of the parental habitat. The differences in survival, size, and growth rates of the progeny of L. scabra in habitats with different salinity regimes are discussed in relation to their potential adaptive significance to life in estuaries

TI  - Acclimation and adaptation to common marine pollutants in the copepod Tigriopus californicus
VL  - 112
SP  - 465-471
AB  - Establishing water quality criteria using bioassays is complicated by variation in chemical tolerance between populations. Two major contributors to this variation are acclimation and adaptation, which are both linked to exposure history, but differ in how long their effects are maintained. Our study examines how tolerance changes over multiple generations of exposure to two common marine pollutants, copper (Cu) and tributyltin oxide (TBTO), in a sexually reproducing marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus. Lines of T. californicus were chronically exposed to sub-lethal levels of Cu and TBTO for 12 generations followed by a recovery period of 3 generations in seawater control conditions. At each generation, the average number of offspring produced and survived to 28 d was determined and used as the metric of tolerance. Lines exposed to Cu and TBTO showed an overall increase in tolerance over time. Increased Cu tolerance arose by generation 3 in the chronically exposed lines and was lost after 3 generations in seawater control conditions. Increased TBTO tolerance was detected at generation 7 and was maintained even after 3 generations in seawater control conditions. It was concluded from this study that tolerance to Cu is consistent with acclimation, a quick gain and loss of tolerance. In contrast, TBTO tolerance is consistent with adaptation, in which onset of tolerance was delayed relative to an acclimation response and maintained in the absence of exposure. These findings illustrate that consideration of exposure history is necessary when using bioassays to measure chemical tolerance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Oxidative stress-mediated synergistic deleterious effects of nano- and microplastics in the hypoxia-conditioned marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis
VL  - 181
AB  - While pollution due to nano- and micro-sized plastics (NMPs) and hypoxic conditions both occur in coastal areas, the deleterious potential of co-exposure to hypoxia and NMPs (hypoxia and micro-sized plastics, HMPs; hypoxia and nano-sized plastics, HNPs) is largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence for multigenerational effects of HMP and HNP in the marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis by investigating changes in its life traits, antioxidant system, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway using an orthogonal experimental design, with nanoscale and microscale particles measuring 0.05 mu m and 6.0 mu m in diameter, respectively, and hypoxic conditions of 0.5 mg/L for six generations. Combined exposure to NMPs and hypoxia caused a significant decrease in fecundity and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The HIF pathway and circadian clock genes were also significantly upregulated in response to HMP and HNP exposure. In particular, synergistic deleterious effects of HNP were evident, suggesting that size-dependent toxicity can be a major driver of the effects of hypoxia and NMP co-exposure. After several generations of exposure, ROS levels returned to basal levels and transcriptomic resilience was observed, although rotifer reproduction remained suppressed. These findings help eluciating the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in responses to plastic pollution in hypoxic conditions.

VL  - 14
AB  - We studied two species of neotropical parasitoids that occur naturally in northeastern Brazil and are associated with Liriomyza sativae (Blanchard): Opius (Gastrosema) scabriventris Nixon (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Chrysocharis vonones (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). We evaluated the influence of seven temperatures on the duration of the egg-adult period and on the survivorship of the immature stages of the parasitoids. A temperature increase from 15 to 30 degrees C shortened the egg-adult period of O. scabriventris and C. vonones. However, at 32 degrees C, the developmental time for the braconid was prolonged, and no difference was observed for the eulophid, compared with 30 degrees C. The highest temperature, 35 degrees C, proved to be lethal for both species. At 15 degrees C, C. vonones pupal survivorship was drastically reduced, whereas that of O. scabriventris was unaffected. At most temperatures, the eulophid had an egg-adult period shorter than or similar to the braconid, except at 15 degrees C. The threshold temperature (Tt) of the egg-adult period for O. scabriventris was 7.3 degrees C with a thermal constant (K) of 257.1 degree days (DD). For C. vonones the Tt was 7.4 degrees C for the total cycle and 6.2 degrees C for the pupal stage, with a thermal constant of 246.3 and 140.3 DD, respectively. These data allow an estimate of 29.4 annual generations for O. scabriventris and 30.5 for C. vonones in a melon production region in northeastern Brazil, values that are equivalent to 4.9 and 6.0 more generations than the host. These results demonstrate that both species have potential for application in biological control programs against the leafminer fly L. sativae.

TI  - Modeling problems in conservation genetics with Brassica rapa: Genetic variation and fitness in plants under mild, stable conditions
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
SP  - 1542-1554
AB  - Rare species are frequently genetically depauperate compared with widespread species, but the degree to which low genetic variation affects short-term viability is still unresolved. We examined the relationship between population-level genetic variation and fitness in small, experimental populations of Brassica rapa ( a Eurasian annual) in a stable, mild environment. We used allozyme and morphological markers to create populations with either high or low levels of genetic variation. We then grew three high-variation and three low-variation populations for six generations under benign growing conditions, with consistent levels of light, nutrients, and water. We measured fitness components and genetic variation throughout the experiment. All populations were maintained at equal sizes (n = 100 seeds to start each generation), and plants were mass-pollinated to avoid differential inbreeding. Under mild conditions, high-variation plants did not have consistently higher fitness than low-variation plants. In generation three, plants in low-variation populations outperformed high-variation plants. In generation four, however, which was subjected to unplanned heat stress, high-variation plants had higher values for many of the fitness components measured, suggesting that, under stress, genetic variation may be associated with a fitness advantage. No differences in multiplicative fitness were found in any generation, indicating that high-and low-variation populations did not differ significantly in overall population viability. Our results indicate that when degree of inbreeding and population size are held constant, genetic variation per se does not increase fitness under benign conditions. As theory predicts, the role of population-level genetic variation may instead be in enhancing the ability of small populations to remain viable under fluctuating, stressful, or novel conditions.

TI  - Thermal Chip Placement in MCMs Using a Novel Hybrid Optimization Algorithm
VL  - 2
IS  - 5
SP  - 764-774
AB  - This paper reports on enhancing the thermal performance of multiple-chip modules (MCMs) that contain a number of chips under natural convection by optimizing the chip placement layout. To attain this goal, an innovative hybrid optimization approach (HOA) incorporating a genetic algorithm (GA) into an algorithm based on a response surface method (RSM) is introduced for improving the performance of both these algorithms. The GA in the proposed HOA is responsible for not only evolving the population toward better fitness value but also, based on the newly evolved populations at each GA generation, for continuously updating the RS mathematical model for better approximation of the chip junction temperature. The sum of the mathematical expressions representing the total system temperature defines the objective of the optimization problems. For each GA generation, a constrained quadratic optimization subproblem is formed, based on the newly updated approximate RS mathematical model as the objective function along with the specified constraints. The solution of the optimization subproblem is sought through a mathematical programming model. As the genetic RS optimization progresses, a sequence of approximate solutions associated with the continuously updated RS mathematical models is constructed. The iterative process continues until convergence of the approximate solutions is attained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm, several thermal design problems associated with two types of MCMs with equal/unequal power are performed. The obtained results are compared with those derived using two conventional approaches-the GA-based and the RSM-based optimization techniques. Results show that the developed algorithm can provide good optimal solutions with much less computational effort, and the larger the scale of the design problems, the more significant the improvement in the computation cost.

TI  - Growth, mortality and fecundity in successive generations of Helix aspersa Muller cultured indoors and crowding effects on fast-, medium- and slow-growing snails of the same clutch
VL  - 64
SP  - 67-74
AB  - This paper examines the optimum conditions for edible snails Helix aspersa to be cultured indoors successfully in successive generations (originating from the crossing of snails coming from different clutches of a previous generation), and the effect of crowding on growth and reproduction in fast-, medium-, and slow-growing snails coming from the same clutches. The time needed for the snails to reach marketable size (25-32 mm) varied from 2.5 to 5 months up to the 7th generation. The time needed for the snails to mature and reproduce from 4 to 7 months until the fifth generation. After the F5 x F5 generation, the final size of the snails decreased. The number of eggs did not differ statistically among the different generations but the reproductive success (how many snails reproduced/cage) increased from F1 = F1 generation onwards to F5 X F5. In F6 x F6 only three (out of 26) snails reproduced and in F7 X F7 none, although the snails remained under controlled conditions for 15 more months. Mortality in the different generations varied from 0-10% up to F5 x F5 but from F6 x F6 onwards increased and reached 25%. Concerning the origin of snails, it was found that larger snails (originating from Kyparissia, Peloponnesos) lay statistically more eggs (138.40 +/- 29.60, N = 5) than smaller ones (77.38 +/- 40.42, N = 4) (originating from Hania, island of Crete). Hatching success was greater, too.

VL  - 197
AB  - In terrestrial ectotherms, body temperatures have a pronounced effect on their physiological processes and life history traits. This study was conducted to determine what the thermal preferences of adult female scorpions, Paruroctonus marksi, are and whether their body temperature influences their escape behavior. There was a significant difference between the mean diurnal (26.11 +/- 0.317 degrees C) and nocturnal (28.55 +/- 0.439 degrees C) body temperatures. Furthermore, each P. marksi sprint speed was tested at 18, 22, 28, 37 degrees C respectively. Ideal sprint speed fell within the range of chosen body temperatures. The highest sprint speed (8.42 +/- 0.483 cm/s) recorded in this study was at 28 degrees C; however, their sprint speed was slower at the higher temperature range (37 degrees C). We can conclude that these scorpions select temperatures that maximize their survival chances when it comes to sprinting abilities.

TI  - FEMALE-BIASED SEX-RATIOS IN A FACULTATIVELY SOCIAL BEE AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL EVOLUTION
VL  - 48
IS  - 5
SP  - 1684-1697
AB  - Montane populations of the Australian allodapine bee, Exoneura bicolor, are characterized by high levels of cooperative nesting and strongly female-biased sex ratios. A conspecific population from heathland shows much lower levels of cooperative nesting and lower levels of female bias. In both habitats, sex-ratio bias is greatest in the smallest brood sizes and becomes successively less biased in larger broods. Parity is approached in the largest heathland colonies, but not for any brood-size category in montane areas. Adult intracolony relatedness is moderately high for colonies in both reused and newly founded nests in the montane habitat, but probably low or zero for newly founded nests in heathland. Colony efficiency, measured as the number of brood per adult, increases with colony size in both habitats, suggesting that cooperation between females increases mean female fitness. It is argued that patterns of sex allocation are consistent with nonlinear fitness-return models, in which the mean reproductive value of daughters increases with the number of daughters produced in a brood. Such increases probably arise from a number of social interactions, including cooperative brood defense, increased task efficiency, and lower per capita costs in nest construction. The term ''local fitness enhancement'' is introduced here to describe these effects collectively. The female-biased ratios should lower selective thresholds for sib-directed altruism, at least in the earlier stages of colony development. It is argued that local fitness enhancement facilitates eusociality in allodapine bees and could also play a role in other haplodiploid taxa, provided cooperative nesting largely involves sisters, colony efficiency increases with colony size, and optimal colony sizes are only achieved after two or more generations after founding.

TI  - Sexual reproduction and short-term fitness advantage in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus: implications for the coexistence of sympatric clones
VL  - 31
IS  - 5
SP  - 987-993
AB  - Large numbers of rotifer eggs from sediment resting egg banks may hatch simultaneously under appropriate conditions; therefore, natural populations are likely to be multiclonal in a growing season. A recent field investigation showed that subordinate and ephemeral clones were able to establish populations in an environment with several strongly dominant clone populations. However, it was not clear how the subordinate populations maintained their growth under these conditions where the crowding signal would induce high levels of sexual reproduction in the dominant clone populations. In the present study, we conducted a continuous passage to 60 generations for new populations at three different temperatures (15A degrees C, 25A degrees C, and 35A degrees C). These populations emerged from resting eggs produced by a clone population. At the first, 30th, and 60th generations, the populations were sampled and fitness was assayed using the life-table method. We found a significant short-term fitness advantage for populations newly emerged from resting eggs produced by a clone population of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, followed by a significant decrease in relative fitness with long-term continuous passage. Our results suggested that the early short-term fitness advantage was important for later-hatched and subordinate clone populations in an environment with multiple sympatric clones. The early short-term fitness might also promote the coexistence of sympatric clones because it could help to offset the cost of early sexual reproduction.

TI  - Beneficial developmental acclimation in reproductive performance under cold but not heat stress
VL  - 90
AB  - Thermal plasticity can help organisms coping with climate change. In this study, we analyse how laboratory populations of the ectotherm species Drosophila subobscura, originally from two distinct latitudes and evolving for several generations in a stable thermal environment (18 degrees C), respond plastically to new thermal challenges. We measured adult performance (fecundity traits as a fitness proxy) of the experimental populations when exposed to five thermal regimes, three with the same temperature during development and adulthood (15-15 degrees C, 18-18 degrees C, 25-25 degrees C), and two where flies developed at 18 degrees C and were exposed, during adulthood, to either 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Here, we test whether (1) flies undergo stress at the two more extreme temperatures; (2) development at a given temperature enhances adult performance at such temperature (i.e. acclimation), and (3) populations with different biogeographical history show plasticity differences. Our findings show (1) an optimal performance at 18 degrees C only if flies were subjected to the same temperature as juveniles and adults; (2) the occurrence of developmental acclimation at lower temperatures; (3) detrimental effects of higher developmental temperature on adult performance; and (4) a minor impact of historical background on thermal response. Our study indicates that thermal plasticity during development may have a limited role in helping adults cope with warmer - though not colder - temperatures, with a potential negative impact on population persistence under climate change. It also emphasizes the importance of analysing the impact of temperature on all stages of the life cycle to better characterize the thermal limits.

TI  - Environmental heterogeneity does not affect levels of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations of three Drosophila species
VL  - 7
IS  - 8
SP  - 2716-2724
AB  - Adaptation of natural populations to variable environmental conditions may occur by changes in trait means and/or in the levels of plasticity. Theory predicts that environmental heterogeneity favors plasticity of adaptive traits. Here we investigated the performance in several traits of three sympatric Drosophila species freshly collected in two environments that differ in the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. Differences in trait means within species were found in several traits, indicating that populations differed in their evolutionary response to the environmental conditions of their origin. Different species showed distinct adaptation with a very different role of plasticity across species for coping with environmental changes. However, geographically distinct populations of the same species generally displayed the same levels of plasticity as induced by fluctuating thermal regimes. This indicates a weak and trait-specific effect of environmental heterogeneity on plasticity. Furthermore, similar levels of plasticity were found in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster with a common geographic origin but adapted to the laboratory conditions for more than 100 generations. Thus, this study does not confirm theoretical predictions on the degree of adaptive plasticity among populations in relation to environmental heterogeneity but shows a very distinct role of species-specific plasticity.

TI  - Synthesizing integrated ecosystem research to create informed stock-specific indicators for next generation stock assessments
VL  - 198
AB  - Over the past two decades, numerous ecosystem surveys and process studies have emerged to monitor and assess the large marine ecosystems of Alaska. Several regional collaborative integrated ecosystem research projects (IERPs) were conducted to gain understanding of fish population fluctuations in relation to the surrounding environment. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) IERP is one example of such an effort. Products of this program include a suite of in situ observations from fully integrated ecosystem surveys, laboratory experiments of physical thresholds for fish condition, and high-resolution oceanographic, planktonic, and habitat distribution models. When coupled, the synthesis products of this program can be utilized to understand system connectivity and highlight the primary ecosystem drivers of the GOA. Much of this information was included in annual GOA ecosystem status reports through individual indicator contributions. However, assimilation of these data into single-species stock assessments has remained limited. We provide a clear and direct avenue for including the products of these IERPs through the new ecosystem and socioeconomic profile (ESP) framework that identifies mechanistic relationships and tests ecosystem linkages within the stock assessment process. We present a case study using a data synthesis of the five commercially and ecologically valuable focal species of the GOAIERP (sablefish, pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific ocean perch). Information was organized along the categories of distribution, phenology, and condition by life history stage to develop life history narratives for each species. These narratives identified critical ecosystem processes that could impact survival of each species. We then used habitat distribution models, seasonal phenology, and energy allocation strategies to sequentially reduce two gridded temperature datasets to reflect the life experience of the stock. This method essentially aligns ecosystem information at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to a stock and creates informed indicators that could then be related to a stock assessment parameter of interest, such as recruitment. Informed temperature indicators differed in magnitude and variability when compared to non-informed indicators and demonstrating species and stage-specific thermal preferences. The difference between the informed indicators and the non informed indicators can also highlight thresholds and trends in habitat preference that could be further investigated with targeted process studies or laboratory experiments. The coordinated nature of the IERP allowed for the creation of these informed indicators that would not be possible with the results of any one process study. Both the stock-specific narratives and the informed indicators can be included into the ESPs for further monitoring and development. This integration ensures that the identified ecosystem linkages are evaluated concurrently with the stock assessment and ultimately transferred to fishery managers in an efficient and effective format for informing management decisions.

VL  - 8
AB  - The longevity of adult codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.) Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and obliquebanded leafroller (Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) held in shaded vials in the tree canopy was measured during the normal flight periods during 2004 and 2005. In both years all codling moths were dead by 130 degree-days (DD) (21 d) in the spring and 121 DD (8 d) in the summer. On a degree-day basis, data were similar across sex, generation, and year, and a common curve adequately predicted the survival distribution. For the obliquebanded leafroller, there were longevity differences between the sexes, but not between generations or years. Use of empirical quantile-quantile plots showed that the female obliquebanded leafroller lived an average of 32% longer than males. Maximum longevity observed in these studies for obliquebanded leafrollers was 117 DD (11 d) across both generations. The implications of these data for population biology studies and quarantine requirements are discussed.

TI  - Local adaptation and the potential effects of a contaminant on predator avoidance and antipredator responses under global warming: a space- for- time substitution approach
VL  - 7
IS  - 3
SP  - 421-430
AB  - The ability to deal with temperature-induced changes in interactions with contaminants and predators under global warming is one of the outstanding, applied evolutionary questions. For this, it is crucial to understand how contaminants will affect activity levels, predator avoidance and antipredator responses under global warming and to what extent gradual thermal evolution may mitigate these effects. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we assessed the potential for gradual thermal evolution shaping activity (mobility and foraging), predator avoidance and antipredator responses when Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae were exposed to zinc in a common-garden warming experiment at the mean summer water temperatures of shallow water bodies at southern and northern latitudes (24 and 20 degrees C, respectively). Zinc reduced mobility and foraging, predator avoidance and escape swimming speed. Importantly, high-latitude populations showed stronger zinc-induced reductions in escape swimming speed at both temperatures, and in activity levels at the high temperature. The latter indicates that local thermal adaptation may strongly change the ecological impact of contaminants under global warming. Our study underscores the critical importance of considering local adaptation along natural gradients when integrating biotic interactions in ecological risk assessment, and the potential of gradual thermal evolution mitigating the effects of warming on the vulnerability to contaminants.

TI  - Increased fitness of a key appendicularian zooplankton species under warmer, acidified seawater conditions
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Ocean warming and acidification (OA) may alter the fitness of species in marine pelagic ecosystems through community effects or direct physiological impacts. We used the zooplanktonic appendicularian, Oikopleura dioica, to assess temperature and pH effects at mesocosm and microcosm scales. In mesocosms, both OA and warming positively impacted O. dioica abundance over successive generations. In microcosms, the positive impact of OA, was observed to result from increased fecundity. In contrast, increased pH, observed for example during phytoplankton blooms, reduced fecundity. Oocyte fertility and juvenile development were equivalent under all pH conditions, indicating that the positive effect of lower pH on O. dioica abundance was principally due to increased egg number. This effect was influenced by food quantity and quality, supporting possible improved digestion and assimilation at lowered pH. Higher temperature resulted in more rapid growth, faster maturation and earlier reproduction. Thus, increased temperature and reduced pH had significant positive impacts on O. dioica fitness through increased fecundity and shortened generation time, suggesting that predicted future ocean conditions may favour this zooplankton species.

TI  - Environmental and genetic influences on pubertal development: Evolutionary life history traits?
SP  - 147-168
AB  - Precocious pubertal development has been observed among girls in single parent families and among girls exposed to family conflict. One explanation for their precocious puberty is that it is evolutionarily adaptive (called here the "life history theory" view). Another explanation is that mothers simply pass on genes for precocious puberty. Thus, family environmental circumstances are not causally determinative of rates of pubertal development. The evidence for these two views was evaluated using the genetically-informative sibling pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both menarcheal age and pubertal timing were heritable (h(2) = .44 and .40, respectively), with negligible shared environmental variation. However, in White girls, greater parental warmth delayed puberty, as did living in two parent families. A test of genetic influences underlying the correlation of warmth and pubertal timing was negative, however. Although some of these findings were inconsistent with the evolutionary life history theory, they did not disprove it decisively.

AB  - Experimental evolution has provided novel insight into a wide array of biological processes. Species in the genus Tetrahymena are proving to be a highly useful system for studying a range of questions using experimental evolution. Their unusual genomic architecture, diversity of life history traits, importance as both predator and prey, and amenability to laboratory culture allow them to be studied in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we review what we are learning from experimental evolution with Tetrahymena about mutation, adaptation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. We predict that future experimental evolution studies using Tetrahyemena will continue to shed new light on these processes.

TI  - Population differences in response to hypoxic stress in Atlantic salmon
VL  - 25
IS  - 12
SP  - 2596-2606
AB  - Understanding whether populations can adapt to new environmental conditions is a major issue in conservation and evolutionary biology. Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to environmental changes linked with human activities in river catchments. For instance, the clogging of bottom substratum by fine sediments is observed in many rivers and usually leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in gravel beds. Such hypoxic stress can alter the development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population. Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no population effect in both treatments. We also detected significant sire x treatment interactions in most populations and a tendency for heritability values to be lower under stressful conditions. Overall, these results reveal a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in salmon populations that nevertheless differ in their adaptive potential to hypoxia given the distinct reaction norms observed between and within populations.

VL  - 53
IS  - 6
SP  - 857-867
AB  - Cold storage of parasitoids to be used in biological control programs is desirable but risky for the performance of the stored parental generation as well as for its offspring. We studied the performance of cold stored and unstored parasitoids after release at different temperature regimes in the laboratory at the level of two subsequent generations in Hyssopus pallidus (Askew) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). This gregarious ectoparasitoid is a candidate biocontrol agent of Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Cydia molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larvae, two fruit pests of high economic significance in apple cultivation. Cold storage for 14 days at 4 degrees C imposed to the pupal stage of the parasitoid did not reduce the parasitism capacity of the parental generation, nor did it alter the female biased sex ratio of the progeny. Remarkably, this short-term storage of the parental generation exhibited a significant and consistently positive effect on offspring weight throughout all ambient temperature regimes, resulting in an increased offspring weight. Furthermore, offspring number was only reduced after release at low ambient temperatures, but not at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Irrespective of whether the parasitoids originated from the stored or unstored group, highest parasitism rate was achieved at temperatures above 20 degrees C. In conclusion, this candidate biocontrol agent can be cold stored for short periods without any measurable quality loss after release at most except at low ambient temperatures. Our findings suggest that H. pallidus is a thermophilous parasitoid that will perform best when applied at warm ambient temperatures in fruit orchards.

TI  - Sustainable Energy Use of a Geothermal Resource: The Case of the Luis Prieto Gomez Plant Dosing Room
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
AB  - Context: Water treatment as an industrial process requires energy for its operation, so, in order to supply the electrical energy that requires the heating of the room in which the dosing process of chemical products is performed, the exploration of alternative energies was proposed through the determination of the environmental and financial viability of a heating system, which uses the heat of the thermal water from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that reaches the Luis Prieto Gomez Plant. Method: A mixed type research was conducted by means of a field study to characterize the context of its use, a specialized advice to determine the heating system, and a bibliographic review to perform the financial analysis by cash flow, the environmental analysis by carbon footprint, and the sustainability of the proposal. Results: The context of the heat use was determined, and the thermal load required inside the room was characterized. Based on this characterization, it was established that a circuit system of tubular heat exchangers generated operational viability with an economic saving projection of 78 %, in comparison with a conventional system and a reduction of environmental impacts represented by a decrease of 3,25 annual tons of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere. Conclusions: The incorporation of energy sustainability for the generation of operating conditions for water treatment was achieved, starting from the conception of the use of thermal water as a renewable resource, together with the production of heat through a closed lifecycle, thus demonstrating a dialogue between the economic, environmental, and social spheres as required by sustainable development.

VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 49-77
AB  - A new multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm for continuous optimization problems is presented. The algorithm has an adaptive cooling schedule and uses a population of fitness functions to accurately generate the Pareto front. Whenever an improvement with a fitness function is encountered, the trial point is accepted, and the temperature parameters associated with the improving fitness functions are cooled. Beside well known linear fitness functions, special elliptic and ellipsoidal fitness functions, suitable for the generation on non-convex fronts, are presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown through five test problems. The parametric study presented shows that more fitness functions as well as more iteration gives more non-dominated points closer to the actual front. The study also compares the linear and elliptic fitness functions. The success of the algorithm is also demonstrated by comparing the quality metrics obtained to those obtained for a well-known evolutionary multiobjective algorithm.

TI  - Thermal experiments with the Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus) (Diptera: Culicidae) and implications for its distribution in Germany
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: As ectothermic animals, temperature influences insects in almost every aspect. The potential disease spreading Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus) is native to temperate East Asia but invasive in several parts of the world. We report on the previously poorly understood temperature-dependence of its life history under laboratory conditions to understand invasion processes and to model temperature niches. Results: To evaluate winter survival, eggs were exposed between 1 day and 14 days to low temperatures (5 degrees C, 0 degrees C, -5 degrees C and -9 degrees C). Hatching success was drastically decreased after exposure to 0 degrees C and -5 degrees C, and the minimal hatching success of 0% was reached at -9 degrees C after two days. We then exposed larvae to 14 temperatures and assessed their life trait parameters. Larval survival to adulthood was only possible between 10 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Based on this, we modelled the optimal (25 degrees C), minimal (7 degrees C) and maximal (31 degrees C) temperature for cumulative female survival. The time to adult emergence ranges from 12 days to 58 days depending on temperature. We used an age-at-emergence-temperature model to calculate the number of potential generations per year for the Asian bush mosquito in Germany with an average of 4.72 potential generations. At lower temperatures, individuals grew larger than at higher temperatures with female R1 length ranging from 3.04 +/- 0.1 mm at 31 degrees C to 4.26 +/- 0.2 mm at 15 degrees C. Conclusions: Reduced egg hatch after exposure to sub-zero temperatures prohibits the establishment of the Asian bush mosquito in large parts of Germany. Larval overwintering is not possible at temperature <= 5 degrees C. The many potential generations displayed per year may contribute to the species' invasion success. This study on the thermal ecology of the Asian bush mosquito adds to our knowledge on the temperature dependence of the species and data could be incorporated in epidemiological and population dynamic modelling.

VL  - 239
SP  - 307-318
AB  - The utilization of renewable biomass and the conversion of renewable energy are promising strategies for providing clean energy and meeting energy needs. In this work, a ternary phase change material gels (PCMGs) composed of octadecanol (OD), styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) are proposed to realize the biomass utilization and solar energy harvesting. As a kind of biomass, OD possesses the characteristics of high phase change latent heat, low cost, renewability, environmental friendliness and biosafety. SEBS provides the crosslinked network to load the OD and introduce the free-standing feature. The HCNTs can realize the highly-efficient solar harvesting through the solar-thermal conversion. The Van der Waals force between SEBS and OD, the 7C -7C interaction between SEBS and HCNTs and the hydrogen bond between OD and HCNTs enable the excellent form-stability. Taking advantages of the synergistic effect of the functional components, the proposed biomass-based PCMGs demonstrate high thermal energy storage capacity of 183.04 Jg(-1), high solar absorbance of 95.68%, high cost-effectiveness of 3.92 x 10-5$J(-1) and high cell viability of 117.9%. The biomass-based PCMGs are effectively applied in the thermoelectric power generation and personal thermal management. This work creates a state-of-the-art alternative for the next-generation solar-thermal materials devices.

SP  - 415-421
AB  - Population dynamics and production of the egg-carrying calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus marinus were studied for a year in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was perennial, with a large numerical peak in June and small peaks in September/October and November/December. During the study period, at least 11 generations could be detected. For each generation, the stage-specific survival from egg to Copepodite Stage (C) V was determined; it was very high during early life stages (egg to NIII), and gradually decreased beyond. On average, 94% of eggs recruited into NIII, which is strongly contrasted with very high (>ca. 90%) mortality during the corresponding stages for free-spawning copepods, i.e. Acastia omorii, Centropages abdominalis and Paracalans sp. This demonstrates that the egg-carrying strategy has a great advantage to reduce mortality in egg stage. The biomass of this species showed marked seasonal variations largely in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous somatic growth rate increased linearly with temperature. The population production rate was estimated as the sum of somatic growth of larval stages and egg production of adult females; the annual integration was 51.0 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) or 0.38 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

TI  - Biomass direct gasification for electricity generation and natural gas replacement in the lime kilns of the pulp and paper industry: A techno-economic analysis
VL  - 237
AB  - This study shows a comparative techno-economic analysis of the integration of biomass gasification for generation of producer gas to be used in electricity production and to replace natural gas in the lime kilns of the pulp and paper industry. Three study cases with alternative configurations of the energy system integrating biomass gasification were analysed, including or not the co-generation of electricity and thermal energy, namely: i) Case I, for generation of electricity from residual forest biomass (RFB) in an integrated gasification combined cycle system, ii) Case II, generation of producer gas by RFB gasification for replacement of natural gas in the burners of a lime kiln, and iii) Case III, as an integration of Cases I and II for combined production of electricity and heat. Residual forest biomass from eucalyptus logging activities for feedstock processing for the pulp and paper industry was considered as fuel for direct (air) gasification in bubbling fiuidized bed. The analysis made is supported on review reports, namely, the evaluation of the existing literature on investment projects in biomass power plants, and on experi-mental investigation for determining the composition of the producer gas from gasification of the selected feedstock. An economic model was developed that combines the net present value, internal rate of return and payback period. The main results of the energy system analysis show that the net electricity generation is between 72 and 83 GWh/year, while the production of CaO in the lime kiln supported by combustion of producer gas, is 82.12 kt/year, and a global energy efficiency between 21.70 and 34.17 % is achieved for the analysed configurations of the energy system. The results of the economic analysis show a positive NPV, an IRR greater than the discount rate and a PBP less than the useful life of the plant. The sensitivity analysis shows quite favorable investment projections given the low probability that the NPV will reach negative values and compromise the economic viability of the project.

TI  - Key biological responses over two generations of the sea urchin Echinometra sp. A under future ocean conditions
VL  - 637
SP  - 87-101
AB  - Few studies have investigated the effects of ocean warming and acidification on marine benthic organisms over ecologically relevant time scales. We used an environmentally controlled coral reef mesocosm system to assess growth and physiological responses of the sea urchin species Echinometra sp. A over 2 generations. Each mesocosm was controlled for temperature and pCO(2) over 29 mo under 3 climate change scenarios (present day and predicted states in 2050 and 2100 under RCP 8.5). The system maintained treatment conditions including annual temperature cycles and a daily variation in pCO(2). Over 20 mo, adult Echinometra exhibited no significant difference in size and weight among the treatments. Growth rates and respiration rates did not differ significantly among treatments. Urchins from the 2100 treatment had elevated ammonium excretion rates and reduced O-2:N ratios, suggesting a change in catabolism. We detected no difference in spawning index scores or oocyte size after 20 mo in the treatments, suggesting that gonad development was not impaired by variations in pCO(2) and temperature reflecting anticipated climate change scenarios. Larvae produced from experimentally exposed adults were successfully settled from all treatments and raised for 5 mo inside the mesocosm. The final size of these juveniles exhibited no significant difference among treatments. Overall, we demonstrated that the mesocosm system provided a near natural environment for this urchin species. Climate change and ocean acidification did not affect the benthic life stages investigated here. Importantly, in previous short-term (weeks to months) experiments, this species exhibited reductions in growth and gonad development, highlighting the potential for short-term experiments with non-acclimated animals to yield contrasting, possibly erroneous results.

TI  - Phenotypic variation in invasive and biocontrol populations of the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis
VL  - 53
IS  - 1
SP  - 89-102
AB  - Despite numerous releases for biological control purposes during more than 20 years in Europe, Harmonia axyridis failed to become established until the beginning of the 21st century. Its status as invasive alien species is now widely recognised. Theory suggests that invasive populations should evolve toward greater phenotypic plasticity because they encounter differing environments during the invasion process. On the contrary, populations used for biological control have been maintained under artificial rearing conditions for many generations; they are hence expected to become specialised on a narrow range of environments and show lower phenotypic plasticity. Here we compared phenotypic traits and the extent of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in two invasive populations and two populations commercialized for biological control by (i) measuring six phenotypic traits related to fitness (eggs hatching rate, larval survival rate, development time, sex ratio, fecundity over 6 weeks and survival time of starving adults) at three temperatures (18, 24 and 30 degrees C), (ii) recording the survival rate and quiescence aggregation behaviour when exposed to low temperatures (5, 10 and 15 degrees C), and (iii) studying the cannibalistic behaviour of populations in the absence of food. Invasive and biocontrol populations displayed significantly different responses to temperature variation for a composite fitness index computed from the traits measured at 18, 24 and 30 degrees C, but not for any of those traits considered independently. The plasticity measured on the same fitness index was higher in the two invasive populations, but this difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, invasive populations displayed significantly higher survival and higher phenotypic plasticity when entering into quiescence at low temperatures. In addition, one invasive population displayed a singular cannibalistic behaviour. Our results hence only partly support the expectation of increased adaptive phenotypic plasticity of European invasive populations of H. axyridis, and stress the importance of the choice of the environmental parameters to be manipulated for assessing phenotypic plasticity variation among populations.

VL  - 103
IS  - 1
SP  - 103-114
AB  - The outcome of hybridization can be impacted by environmental conditions, which themselves can contribute to reproductive isolation between taxa. In crosses of genetically divergent populations, hybridization can have both negative and positive impacts on fitness, the balance between which might be tipped by changes in the environment. Genetically divergent populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus have been shown to differ in thermal tolerance at high temperatures along a latitudinal gradient. In this study, a series of crosses were made between pairs of genetically divergent populations of T. californicus, and the thermal tolerance of these hybrids was tested. In most cases, the first-generation hybrids had relatively high thermal tolerance and the second-generation hybrids were not generally reduced below the less-tolerant parental population for high temperature tolerance. This pattern contrasts with previous studies from crosses of genetically divergent populations of this copepod, which often shows hybrid breakdown in these second-generation hybrids for other measures of fitness. These results suggest that high temperature stress could either increase the positive impacts of hybridization or decrease the negative impacts of hybridization resulting in lowered hybrid breakdown in these population crosses.

VL  - 41
SP  - 54-62
AB  - Overwintering is a serious challenge for insects, and winters are rapidly changing as climate shifts. The capacity for phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation will determine which species profit or suffer from these changes. Here we discuss current knowledge on the potential and evidence for evolution in winter-relevant traits among insect species and populations. We conclude that the best evidence for evolutionary shifts in response to changing winters remain those related to changes in phenology, but all evidence points to cold hardiness as also having the potential to evolve in response to climate change. Predicting future population sizes and ranges relies on understanding to what extent evolution in winter-related traits is possible, and remains a serious challenge.

VL  - 25
IS  - 7
SP  - 1376-1389
AB  - The joint effect of increasing temperature and pollution on aquatic organisms is important to understand and predict, as a combination of stressors might be more noxious when compared to their individual effects. Our goal was to determine the sensitivity of a model organism (Daphnia spp.) to contaminants at increasing temperatures, allowing prior acclimation of the organisms to the different temperatures. Prior to exposure, two Daphnia genotypes (Daphnia longispina species complex) were acclimated to three temperatures (17, 20, and 23 A degrees C). Afterwards, a crossed design was established using different exposure temperatures and a range of concentrations of two common fungicides (tebuconazole and copper). Daphnia life history parameters were analysed in each temperature x toxicant combination for 21 days. Temperature was the most influencing factor: Daphnia reproduced later and had lower fecundity at 17 A degrees C than at 20 and 23 A degrees C. Both copper and tebuconazole also significantly reduced the fecundity and survival of Daphnia at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Temperature-dependence was found for both toxicants, but the response pattern was endpoint- and genotype-specific. The combination of contaminant and high temperature often had severe effects on survival. However, unlike some literature on the subject, our results do not support the theory that increasing temperatures consistently foment increasing reproductive toxicity. The absence of a clear temperature-dependent toxicity pattern may result from the previous acclimation to the temperature regime. However, a proper framework is lacking to compare such studies and to avoid misleading conclusions for climate change scenarios.

TI  - Development of metal adaptation in a tropical marine zooplankton
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Tropical marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to pollution and climate change. It is relatively unknown how tropical species may develop an increased tolerance to these stressors and the cost of adaptations. We addressed these issues by exposing a keystone tropical marine copepod, Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, to copper (Cu) for 7 generations (F1-F7) during three treatments: control, Cu and pCu (the recovery treatment). In F7, we tested the "contaminant-induced climate change sensitivity" hypothesis (TICS) by exposing copepods to Cu and extreme temperature. We tracked fitness and productivity of all generations. In F1, Cu did not affect survival and grazing but decreased nauplii production. In F2-F4, male survival, grazing, and nauplii production were lower in Cu, but recovered in pCu, indicating transgenerational plasticity. Strikingly, in F5-F6 nauplii production of Cu-exposed females increased, and did not recover in pCu. The earlier result suggests an increased Cu tolerance while the latter result revealed its cost. In F7, extreme temperature resulted in more pronounced reductions in grazing, and nauplii production of Cu or pCu than in control, supporting TICS. The results suggest that widespread pollution in tropical regions may result in high vulnerability of species in these regions to climate change.

TI  - Slow inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster express as much inbreeding depression as fast inbred lines under semi-natural conditions
VL  - 139

SP  - 441-451
AB  - Selection may reduce the deleterious consequences of inbreeding. This may be due to purging of recessive deleterious alleles or balancing selection favouring heterozygote offspring. Such selection is expected to be more efficient at slower compared to at faster rates of inbreeding. In this study we tested the impact of inbreeding and the rate of inbreeding on fitness related traits (egg productivity, egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and behaviour) under cold and benign semi-natural thermal conditions using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. We used non-inbred control and slow and fast inbred lines (both with an expected inbreeding level of 0.25). The results show that contrary to expectations the slow inbred lines do not maintain higher average fitness than the fast inbred lines. Furthermore, we found that stressful environmental conditions increased the level of inbreeding depression but the impact of inbreeding rate on the level of inbreeding depression was not affected by the environmental conditions. The results do not support the hypothesis that inbreeding depression is less severe with slow compared to fast rates of inbreeding and illustrate that although selection may be more efficient with slower rates of inbreeding this does not necessary lead to less inbreeding depression.

TI  - Transgenerational effects and acclimation affect dispersal in guppies
VL  - 32
IS  - 7
SP  - 1819-1831
AB  - 1. Evolutionary theory predicts that intergenerational environmental fluctuations lead to transgenerational effects where offspring phenotypes are matched to conditions experienced by previous generations. However, in fluctuating environments, transgenerational effects can be detrimental by causing mismatches between ancestral and offspring environments. Acclimation in offspring could alleviate these negative effects. 2. We determined whether the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation affects locomotor performance and dispersal in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). In a fully factorial experiment, we tested the interaction between ancestral (22 or 30 degrees C for six to eight generations), acclimation (22 or 30 degrees C for 4weeks) and acute test temperatures (two to five temperatures across 18-34 degrees C). We predicted that matching ancestral and acclimation temperatures to acute environmental temperature maximises physiological capacities (swimming performance [U-crit] and metabolic enzyme activities), and dispersal in an artificial stream. Alternatively, when ancestral and acute temperatures were mismatched, we predicted that thermal acclimation compensates for this mismatch by shifting performance curves. Finally, we hypothesised that physiological capacities are positively related to dispersal. We measured dispersal as a combination of traits characterising the departure and transient phases of dispersal (time taken to leave the introductory pool, voluntary speed against the current, number of dispersal decisions taken) in an 8-m artificial stream. 3. As hypothesised, U-crit was greatest when ancestral, acclimation and acute temperatures matched. Cold acclimation reduced the decrement in U-crit resulting from a mismatch between ancestral and acute test temperatures. In both sexes, the interaction between ancestral and acclimation temperatures determined U-crit, but not metabolic enzyme activities, and it affected the number of dispersal decisions in males only. Contrary to our hypothesis, physiological capacities did not constrain dispersal. Males were more likely to initiate dispersal when the acute temperatures mismatched their ancestral temperature. After initiating dispersal, males moved at a greater voluntary speed and made more dispersal decisions in environments matching their ancestral environment. 4. Our findings imply that although the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation modulates locomotor capacities, these relationships do not necessarily translate to all ecologically relevant locomotor tasks. Instead, sex-specific life-history traits such as life span are more likely to influence dispersal, and males in particular may initiate dispersal to escape suboptimal conditions.

AB  - The use of solar energy in thermal desalination processes is one of the most promising applications of the renewable energies. Solar desalination can either be direct; use solar energy to produce distillate directly in the solar collector, or indirect; combining conventional desalination techniques, such as multistage flash desalination (MSF), vapor compression (VC), reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD) and electrodialysis, with solar collectors for heat generation. Direct solar desalination compared with the indirect technologies requires large land areas and has a relatively low productivity. It is however competitive to the indirect desalination plants in small-scale production due to its relatively low cost and simplicity. This paper describes several desalination technologies in commercial and pilot stages of development. The primary focus is on those technologies suitable for use in remote areas, especially those which could be integrated into solar thermal energy systems.

TI  - Augmented performance of tubular solar still integrated with cost-effective nano-based mushrooms
VL  - 228
SP  - 27-37
AB  - The current work aimed to enlarge freshwater production and improve tubular solar still (TSS) performance via pure and nano-coated (with carbon black nanoparticles) mushrooms. Pure mushrooms were used due to their structure that allows effective vapor generation through achieving good solar absorptivity, capillary effect, and heat localization on the surface. In addition, carbon black coating was proposed to improve surface absorptivity, heat localization, and thermal conductivity. The performance of the developed TSS (DTSS) was evaluated, compared to conventional TSS (CTSS), through a series of tests: first using pure mushrooms, and then via three quantities of carbon black (CB) nanocoating (25, 50, and 75 g/m2). Besides, the thermal performance was analyzed from the heat transfer coefficients, energy and exergy efficiencies points of view. Finally, a feasibility study was conducted by calculating the cost per liter of the yield for all cases. The results revealed that, compared to CTSS, the productivity increased by 59.05%, achieving a saving in production cost by 33.85 % using nanocoated mushrooms (DTSS with 50 g/m2). Besides, the thermal performance was enhanced by 55.38 and 129.95% for energy, and exergy efficiencies, respectively. Hence, the proposed work introduced an effective and feasible improvement in the field of TSSs.

TI  - Persistent shift of Calanus spp. in the southwestern Norwegian Sea since 2003, linked to ocean climate
VL  - 73
IS  - 5
SP  - 1319-1329
AB  - The southwestern Norwegian Sea is characterized by an inflow of warm and saline Atlantic water from the southwest and cold and less saline East IcelandicWater (EIW), of Arctic origin, from the northwest. These two water masses meet and form the Iceland-Faroe Front (IFF). In this region, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus plays a key role in the pelagic ecosystem. Time-series of C. finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus in May and September, extending back to the early 1990s, were studied in relation to phytoplankton bloom dynamics and hydrography. The main reproductive period of C. finmarchicus started consistently earlier south of the IFF, resulting in different life cycles and stage compositions in the twowater masses. In 2003, a sudden shift occurred north of the IFF, resulting in a similar phenology pattern to south of the IFF. Before this, only one generation of C. finmarchicus was produced in the Arctic water, but the earlier reproduction enabled the species to produce two generations after 2003. Simultaneously, C. hyperboreus, an expatriate in the EIW, largely disappeared. Food availability is unlikely the reason for the phenological differences observed across the front, as the typical pattern of the phytoplankton spring bloom showed an earlier onset north of the IFF. Temperature and salinity peaked at record high values in 2003 and 2004, and therefore possible links to oceanography are discussed. The dominant role of Calanus spp. and the potential linkages to water mass exchanges may herald strong effects on the ecosystem and pelagic fish in this subpolar Atlantic region under expected climate change.

The technique included developing a novel larval diet with no bulking agent. The mean life-cycle parameters for B. melanotus and B. xanthodes, respectively, at 26 +/- 1 degrees C were: egg hatch, 40 h and 44 h; egg to pupa, 10 days for both species; preoviposition period, 21 days and 12 days; egg to egg, 44 days and 35 days. Colonies were maintained in the laboratory for over 20 consecutive generations. Results are discussed in relation to production of eggs and various larval instars for postharvest disinfestation research.

An original iteration scheme was used to solve the system of nonlinear continuity equations and the Poisson equation. All quantities are expressed as functions of electric potential and Fermi quasi-levels. The results of calculations are presented as the maps showing spatial distribution of sensitivity and density of noise generation for 4 types of heterostructures. In addition, resulting parameters of the devices are summarized in the table. This approach may help to understand specific features of the heterostructural devices and optimize their performance. The simulations show viability of constructing devices with active region buried inside a wide gap material where existing potential barriers prevent adverse effects of both recombination of photogenerated carriers and thermal generation at surfaces, interfaces and contacts.

AB  - This paper traces the development of a software tool, based oil a combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and a few process equations. aiming to serve as a backup operation instrument in the reference generation for real-time controllers of a steel tandem cold mill By emulating the mathematical model responsible for generating presets under normal operational conditions, the system works as ail option to maintain plant operation in the event of a failure in the processing unit that executes the mathematical model. The system, built from the production data collected over six years of plant operation, steered to the replacement of the former backup operation mode (based oil a lookup table). which degraded both product quality and plant productivity. The study showed that ANN are appropriated tools for the intended purpose and that by this instrument it is possible to achieve nearly the totality of the presets needed by this land of process. The text characterizes the problem, relates the investigated options to solve it. justifies the choice of the ANN approach, describes the methodology and system implementation and, finally, shows and discusses the attained results.

SP  - 1943-1962
AB  - The growing understanding of the link between carbon emissions and global warming has been promoting a discussion on the environmental and safety viability of nuclear power generation. Current open fuel cycle reactors, however, result in low energy efficiency and produce large volumes of nuclear waste. More advanced nuclear reactors, which are currently under investigation, are expected to allow more efficient and safer use of nuclear energy. In all these cases, the fuel cladding is the most important safety barrier in fission nuclear reactors, as it restrains most of the radioactive fission products within its volume. The selection of fuel cladding material is based on many design constraints, such as neutron absorption cross section, service temperature, mechanical strength, toughness, neutron radiation resistance, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and chemical compatibility. The present paper reviews the selection of nuclear fuel cladding materials since the early reactors, illustrating some of the main failure modes and briefly discussing the challenges facing the development of fuel cladding materials for generation IV reactors.

SP  - 5182-5197
AB  - The sustainability of a small-scale self-consumption wood-energy chain for heat generation in central Italy was analyzed from a technical, economic and energetic point of view. A micro-chain was developed within the CRA-ING farm at Monterotondo (Rome, Italy): The purpose of this system was to produce biomass for supplying a heating plant within the CRA-ING property as a substitute for diesel fuel. A poplar short rotation coppice, established with clones AF2, AF6 and Monviso, fed the micro-chain. The rotation was biennial. The average plantation production (Mg-d.m.center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)) was 10.2, with a maximum of 13.53 for the twin-rows AF2 and a minimum of 8.00 for the single-row Monviso. The economic assessment was based on the Net Present Value (NPV) method and the equivalent annuity cost, and found an average saving of 15.60 euro center dot GJ(-1) of heat generated by the wood chips heating system in comparison with the diesel heating system over a 10 year lifetime of the thermal power plant. The energy assessment of the poplar plantation, carried out using the Gross Energy Requirements method, reported an energy output/input ratio of 12.3. The energy output/input ratio of the whole micro-chain was 4.5.

TI  - Support for the evolutionary speed hypothesis from intraspecific population genetic data in the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius
VL  - 283
IS  - 1825
AB  - The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) proposes a causal mechanism for the latitudinal diversity gradient. The central idea of the ESH is that warmer temperatures lead to shorter generation times and increased mutation rates. On an absolute time scale, both should lead to an acceleration of selection and drift. Based on the ESH, we developed predictions regarding the distribution of intraspecific genetic diversity: populations of ectothermic species with more generations per year owing to warmer ambient temperatures should be more differentiated from each other, accumulate more mutations and show evidence for increased mutation rates compared with populations in colder regions. We used the multivoltine insect species Chironomus riparius to test these predictions with cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data and found that populations from warmer regions are indeed significantly more differentiated and have significantly more derived haplotypes than populations from colder regions. We also found a significant correlation of the annual mean temperature with the population mutation parameter 0 that serves as a proxy for the per generation mutation rate under certain assumptions. This pattern could be corroborated with two nuclear loci. Overall, our results support the ESH and indicate that the thermal regime experienced may be crucially driving the evolution of ectotherms and may thus ultimately govern their speciation rate.

TI  - Experience from ABB's PFBC technology and its application to utility size power plants
SP  - 614-620
AB  - Almost 95,000 hours of operation have been accumulated on widely different coals in Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combined Cycle (PFBC) plants in Sweden, Spain, USA and Japan. Valuable feedback has been obtained from these P200 plants, in the 70-150 MWe range, and has been subsequently incorporated into the design of the world's first P800 PFBC plant. This 360 MWe plant is currently under construction at Karita in Japan for Kyushu Electric Power Co. by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy industries (IHI), one of ABB's licensees in Japan. The combined experience from ABB's existing PFBC plants has demonstrated the viability of ABB's PFBC technology and the general simplicity of the concept, as well as plant control principles and serviceability. As a result, this technology is now commercially offered worldwide by ABB Carbon, together with its licensees and partners, and PFBC is being recognized as a competitive solution for generation of power and for combined heat and power applications. The combined cycle feature makes PFBC highly efficient for power generation. When compared with conventional power plants, and for the same steam conditions, a PFBC plant typically produces 10% more electricity from the same amount of coal. Fuel flexibility is also a keystone of the PFBC technology. Even with a standard plant, PFBC can use a wide range of coals, and other solid fuels. This was a prerequisite for the Karita plant, which is designed to use any coal from a broad spectrum. This paper summarizes the operation experiences from the first P200 plants, Vartan in Sweden, Tidd in USA, Escatron in Spain and the next, improved design in Wakamatsu, Japan. The design principles used and risk mitigation for the utility sized P800 power plant are also discussed.

VL  - 208

SP  - 2615-2620
AB  - contrast to previous studies of rapid cold-hardening (RCH), which have investigated the responses of insects maintained under 'summer conditions' (20 degrees to 25 degrees C), this study focuses on the ability of low-temperature acclimated insects to undergo RCH. When the grain aphid Sitobion avenae Fabricus was low-temperature acclimated by rearing for three generations at 10 degrees C, the discriminating temperatures (temperature that results in approximately 20% survival after direct transfer from the rearing temperature to a sub-zero temperature for a period of 3 h), of first instar nymphs and adult aphids were -11.5 degrees and -12 degrees C, respectively. Maximum rapid cold-hardening was induced by cooling aphids at 0 degrees C for 2 h (nymphs) or 30 min (adults), resulting in survival at the respective discriminating temperatures increasing from 26% to 96% (nymphs) and 22% to 70% (adults). Cooling from 10 degrees to 0 degrees C at 1 degrees, 0.1 degrees and 0.05 degrees C min(-1) significantly increased survival of nymphs at the discriminating temperature, but not of adults. There were no 'ecological costs' associated with rapid cold-hardening at 0 degrees C, or with exposure of rapidly cold-hardened aphids to the discriminating temperatures; fecundity and longevity, in both nymphs and adults were either similar to control aphids or significantly increased. The study demonstrates that rapid cold-hardening ability is retained in aphids that have already undergone cold-acclimation, as would be the case in overwintering aphids. Both rapid cold-hardening and subsequent exposure at previously lethal temperatures can enhance fitness in surviving individuals.

TI  - THE REDUCING OF CO2 EMISSIONS OF THERMAL POWER PLANT THROUGH USING ENERGY MIX BIOMASS-COAL
SP  - 739-744
AB  - Environmental impact due to power generation through coal combustion sector is well known because inevitably interferes with the environment. Today, especially in the EU climate protection policies and the environment, especially trough measure to reduce CO2, are becoming more radical making the use of coal more difficult. This even more because in December 2015 was signed Paris Agreement which aims reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2 as a measure to combat climate change and global warming so that global warming be below 2 degrees C. One of the possibilities to achieve this target is use of biomass to electrical energy production. Biomass resource neutral in terms of carbon dioxide can be an important element of diversification of energy sources because it is very accessible and includes, apart from waste biomass and energy crops with high productivity calorific interesting that can also be used to restore degraded industrial land. The aim of the present study is to present a possibility of co-combustion biomass with lignite in large boiler of thermal power plants.

TI  - A hybrid PV/T and Kalina cycle for power generation
VL  - 42
IS  - 15
SP  - 4817-4829
AB  - This work introduces a novel hybrid system which uses the cooling water of a concentrated PV/T as a preheated water for lithium bromide-water-based Kalina cycle. The PV/T is a combination between solar photovoltaic cells and solar thermal collector. The solar cells convert the sunlight into electricity, and the remaining heat gets absorbed by the collector for additional power generation. As well as, extracting the excess heat from PV cells enhances its electrical efficiency. The Kalina power cycle is mainly driven by concentrated solar parabolic collectors (CSP). The advantage of combining these 2 systems is to employ the heat rejected from the concentrated solar-based PV cells for further electricity generation, thus increasing the system overall efficiency. The system of concentrated solar collectors is divided into 2 parts to avoid getting very high temperature for the PV cells: concentrated solar collectors with PV cells and without PV cells. Due to the high temperature of water which returns from the Kalina cycle, a cooling tower is employed to cool the water before entering the concentrated PV/T system. The mathematical model of the proposed system has been presented and simulated to investigate the effect of the main controlling variables on the proposed system performance: generator temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and the ambient temperature. The results show that the amount of solar radiation is the primary variable for the investigated system energy productivity, while the design temperature of generator is found to be the most parameter that affects the system overall efficiency. While the overall efficiency is around 18% to 23%, combining PV/T with the proposed solar Kalina cycle increases the system overall efficiency by 22% to 27%. The electrical conversion efficiency of the proposed system is 40% to 68% much more compared to PV/T alone system.

AB  - Physiological limits determine susceptibility to environmental changes, and can be assessed at the individual, population or species/lineage levels. Here I discuss these levels in Drosophila, and consider implications for determining species susceptibility to climate change. Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which traits are evaluated. At the population level, evidence from selection experiments particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high levels of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stresses and aridity. An exception is resistance to high temperatures, which reaches a plateau in selection experiments and has a low heritability/evolvability when temperatures are ramped up to a stressful level. In tropical Drosophila species, populations are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance. Population limits can arise from trait and gene interactions but results from different laboratory studies are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interactions under field conditions. Species and lineage comparisons suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extremes and other stresses. Plastic responses set individual limits but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila. There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limits and desiccation resistance compared with upper limits, which might reflect different selection pressures and/or low evolvability. When extremes are considered, tropical Drosophila species do not appear more threatened than temperate species by higher temperatures associated with global warming, contrary to recent conjectures. However, species from the humid tropics may be threatened if they cannot adapt genetically to drier conditions.

TI  - Hybrid Pressure Retarded Osmosis-Membrane Distillation System for Power Generation from Low-Grade Heat: Thermodynamic Analysis and Energy Efficiency
VL  - 48
IS  - 9
SP  - 5306-5313
AB  - We present a novel hybrid membrane system that operates as a heat engine capable of utilizing low-grade thermal energy, which is not readily recoverable with existing technologies. The closed-loop system combines membrane distillation (MD), which generates concentrated and pure water streams by thermal separation, and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), which converts the energy of mixing to electricity by a hydro-turbine. The PRO-MD system was modeled by coupling the mass and energy flows between the thermal separation (MD) and power generation (PRO) stages for heat source temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 degrees C and working concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mol/kg NaCl. The factors controlling the energy efficiency of the heat engine were evaluated for both limited and unlimited mass and heat transfer kinetics in the thermal separation stage. In both cases, the relative flow rate between the MD permeate (distillate) and feed streams is identified as an important operation parameter. There is an optimal relative flow rate that maximizes the overall energy efficiency of the PRO-MD system for given working temperatures and concentration. In the case of unlimited mass and heat transfer kinetics, the energy efficiency of the system can be analytically determined based on thermodynamics. Our assessment indicates that the hybrid PRO-MD system can theoretically achieve an energy efficiency of 9.8% (81.6% of the Carnot efficiency) with hot and cold working temperatures of 60 and 20 degrees C, respectively, and a working solution of 1.0 M NaCl. When mass and heat transfer kinetics are limited, conditions that more closely represent actual operations, the practical energy efficiency will be lower than the theoretically achievable efficiency. In such practical operations, utilizing a higher working concentration will yield greater energy efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates the theoretical viability of the PRO-MD system and identifies the key factors for performance optimization.

VL  - 45
IS  - 5
SP  - 1172-1179
AB  - 1. Understanding the conditions that allow for the occurrence of an additional generation in populations that are usually univoltine is important under the present climate warming. In temperate areas, a second generation is enabled through the emergence of a time window that opens when first-generation individuals are ready to reproduce and closes when second-generation individuals cannot complete development before the onset of winter. 2. The conditions that limit the width of this window were studied inPyrrhocoris apterus(Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae), a ground-inhabiting heteropteran overwintering in facultative adult diapause, whose populations in Central Europe have typically been univoltine until the 1980s. 3. The frequency of females of the first generation that started to lay eggs decreased from 70% in June to zero in early August, but oviposition of these females continued until the end of August. Using thermal constants for egg-adult development and temperature data, this study found that the development of most second-generation individuals could only be completed before the start of winter if hastened through behavioural thermoregulation. 4. Consequences of temperature increase on the width of the thermal window were calculated. Increasing temperature causes the time window to open earlier and close later by accelerating maturation of first-generation females and improving conditions for maturing of the second-generation individuals in late summer and autumn. 5. Climate warming will create conditions that facilitate the occurrence of a second generation in a year in typically univoltine populations of this species.

VL  - 156
IS  - 4
SP  - 1973-1982
AB  - Using multilocus individual heterozygosity, a method is developed to estimate the outcrossing rates of a population over a few previous generations. Considering that individuals originate either from outcrossing or from n successive selfing generations from an outbred ancestor, a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator is described that gives estimates of past outcrossing rates in terms of proportions of individuals with different n values. Heterozygosities at several unlinked codominant loci are used to assign n values to each individual. This method also allows a test of whether populations are in inbreeding equilibrium. The estimator's reliability was checked using simulations for different mating histories. We show that this ML estimator can provide estimates of outcrossing rates for the final generation outcrossing rate (t(0)) and a mean of the preceding rates (t(p)) and can detect major temporal variation in the mating system. The method is most efficient foe low to intermediate outcrossing levels. Applied to nine populations of wheat, this method gave estimates of t(0) and t(p). These estimates confirmed the absence of outcrossing (t(0) = 0) in the two populations subjected to manual selling. For free-mating wheat populations, it detected lower final generation outcrossing rates (t(0) = 0-0.06) than those expected from global heterozygosity (t = 0.02-0.09). This estimator appears to be a new and efficient way to describe the multilocus heterozygosity of a population, complementary to Fis and progeny analysis approaches.

AB  - Biodiesel was generated through whole cell catalyzed transesterification of acid oil, to the extent of up to 92%. The fuel properties of biodiesel (B100) and its blend (B20) were determined and compared with standard biodiesel as per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard (ASTM D6751). B100 and B20 showed good pour point of -26 degrees C and -29 degrees C, respectively, indicating their operation viability in colder environment. Other properties of biodiesel are quite similar to petroleum diesel and ASTM standard. The results of this study reveal the potential use of acid oil as feedstock for generation of fuel grade biodiesel through biocatalyzed transesterification.

VL  - 14
SP  - 16-30
AB  - The 2022 World Cup creates great opportunities for the country of Qatar, but also poses significant challenges. In this study the main challenge of maintaining thermal comfort conditions within the football arenas is presented, with respect to the heat stress index (HSI) and the aero-thermal comfort thresholds established for opened stadiums. Potential cooling strategies for delivering tolerant comfort levels are introduced, followed by their functional strengths and limitations for the hot-humid climate of Qatar. An estimation of the cooling load for semi-outdoor stadiums in Qatar is also presented. The results, produced by dynamic thermal modelling, indicated that a load of 115 MW h per game should be at least consumed in order to provide both indoor and outdoor thermal comfort conditions. Finally, the use of solar energy technologies for the generation of electricity and cooling are evaluated, based on their viability beyond the 2022 World Cup event, towards the nation's targets for sustainability and lasting legacy.

VL  - 24
IS  - 5
SP  - 1115-1127
AB  - Oviposition-site choice has profound fitness consequences for both a mother and her offspring. The adaptive significance of oviposition behaviour for both generations depends on two rarely considered assumptions: (1) the fit of maternal oviposition preferences with local phenotypic optimum (adaptive accuracy) and (2) the predictability of future conditions for developing offspring based on conditions at the time of oviposition. We examined both assumptions using temperature oviposition preferences (T (p,o)) previously measured under laboratory conditions in the alpine newt, Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris. Analyses of temperature time series in the newt natural environment revealed, in agreement with oviposition-site choice of female newts, that T (p,o) were closer to phenotypic optima at the water surface than at the maximal depth (bottom). Temperature time series in both depths contained a high proportion of predictable variation, though bottom thermal conditions were more predictable than those at the water surface. We concluded that female newts have to trade the adaptive accuracy of T (p,o) for the predictability of future thermal conditions at the time of oviposition.

TI  - Climate change reduces offspring fitness in littoral spawners: a study integrating organismic response and long-term time-series
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 373-386
AB  - Integrating long-term ecological observations with experimental findings on species response and tolerance to environmental stress supports an understanding of climate effects on population dynamics. Here, we combine the two approaches, laboratory experiments and analysis of multi-decadal time-series, to understand the consequences of climate anomalies and ongoing change for the population dynamics of a eurythermal littoral species, Carcinus aestuarii. For the generation of cause and effect hypotheses we investigated the thermal response of crab embryos at four developmental stages. We first measured metabolic rate variations in embryos following acute warming (16-24 degrees C) and after incubation at 20 and 24 degrees C for limited periods. All experiments consistently revealed differential thermal responses depending on the developmental stage. Temperature-induced changes in metabolic activity of early embryonic stages of blastula and gastrula suggested the onset of abnormal development. In contrast, later developmental stages, characterized by tissue and organ differentiation, were marginally affected by temperature anomalies, indicating enhanced resilience to thermal stress. Then, we extended these findings to a larger, population scale, by analyzing a time-series of C. aestuarii landings in the Venice lagoon from 1945 to 2010 (ripe crabs were recorded separately) in relation to temperature. Landings and extreme climatic events showed marked long-term and short-term variations. We found negative relationships between landings and thermal stress indices on both timescales, with time lags consistent with an impact on crab early life stages. When quantitatively evaluating the influence of thermal stress on population dynamics, we found that it has a comparable effect to that of the biomass of spawners. This work provides strong evidence that physiological responses to climatic anomalies translate into population-level changes and that apparently tolerant species may be impacted before the ontogeny of eurythermy. These ontogenetic bottlenecks markedly shape population dynamics and require study to assess the effects of global change.

AB  - In the present research, an air-suspension fluidized-bed technique for generation of core and shell microcapsules containing probiotic Lactobacillusparacasei cells was evaluated. The air-suspension process was performed in a Wurster coater system with a bottom-spraying atomizer. In the first stage, a solution containing trehalose, maltodextrin, and probiotic cells was spray-coated onto and absorbed by the inert carrier microcrystalline cellulose to produce nonagglomerating dry coated particles with high probiotic cell viability (10 9 colony-forming units [cfu]/g particles). The effect of inlet air temperature, spray flow rate, solids concentration, cell concentration, and encapsulation formulation on survival was investigated. The inlet air temperature had the most pronounced effect; a 15 degrees C increase in inlet air temperature led to a 250-fold decrease in survival percentage. There was no agglomeration of the coated adsorbed particles at spray flow rates of 1 to 3.5 mL/min. Spray-coating was performed with both laboratory-and pilot-scale Wurster systems. Scaling up the equipment from the lab scale to the pilot scale did not affect cell survival percentage. Low solids concentration (<20%) and low probiotic cell concentration (6%) resulted in a fair survival percentage (35-40). Spraying a solution formulation of trehalose-maltodextrin with dextrose equivalent (DE) 3 at a 1: 1 ratio provided the best protection in terms of cell viability during the spray-coating process as well during storage. Layering with ethylcellulose (ETHOCEL) provided some protection in a low acidic environment (12%); however, the nonuniform coating and cracks detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging were the main reasons for the layering's relatively poor protection of the cells against humidity, oxygen, and acid environment.

VL  - 46
IS  - 4
SP  - 978-987
AB  - Ontsira mellipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a North American parasitoid species that develops on the invasive pest, Anoplophora glabripennis (Moltschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), under laboratory conditions and is currently being considered as a potential new-association biocontrol agent. To develop mass-rearing protocols and field-release strategies for this parasitoid, information on its reproductive biology in relation to temperature is needed. We determined the effect of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) on development, survivorship, and sex ratio, and its effect on the longevity, fecundity, and host attack rates (parasitism) of adults. Developmental time for parasitoid eggs to pupae decreased from 26.7 d to 6.1 d as temperature increased from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C. While no pupae eclosed as adults at 10 degrees C, time of adult emergence from pupae decreased from 39.7 d to 12.2 d as temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Based on estimated lower development temperature threshold (11.1 degrees C), the degree-days required for one generation was estimated at 342.9. When female parasitoids were provided with host larvae, parasitism occurred at all temperatures and was maximized at 25 degrees C. Additionally, increasing temperatures significantly reduced the preoviposition period and longevity of female O. mellipes. In addition, combining these results with temperature data from areas in the United States currently infested with A. glabripennis, we estimated that O. mellipes can complete 1.2-3.7 generations per year. Findings from this study may be considered for the future development of effective mass rearing and augmentative release strategies of O. mellipes for biological control of A. glabripennis.

VL  - 178
SP  - 46-50
AB  - Changes in temperature across geographic gradients can occur on a wide temporal range, from fluctuations within hours as a result of day-night to those over many years. These events will drive many organisms towards their physiological limits of thermal tolerance. Recently, many reports support a limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses to high temperatures, meaning a conserved heat tolerance among ectotherms in general. We address this problem and tested the heat and cold tolerance invariant-variant hypotheses in terrestrial isopods. We studied five different populations of Porcellio laevis and three populations of Porcellio scaber, spanning 30 degrees S latitudinal gradient in Chile. The heat tolerance of woodlice was conserved with little variation along latitude and environmental temperatures, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with environmental temperatures and latitudes. Indeed, a significant and negative correlation was observed between cold tolerance and latitude. Also, significant and positive correlations were observed among cold tolerance and environmental temperatures. Conversely, heat tolerance was not significantly correlated with any of the environmental temperatures tested neither with latitude. This macrophysiological pattern indicated that heat and cold-tolerances of species and populations not always change across geographical gradients meaning that thermal tolerance responses to high temperatures may be evolutionary constrained.

SP  - 128-133
AB  - Mayfly nymphs are among the most sensitive taxa to neonicotinoids. The present study presents the acute and chronic toxicity of 3 neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) to a mayfly species (Cloeon dipterum) and some notes on the seasonality of the toxicity of imidacloprid to C. dipterum and 5 other invertebrate species. Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam showed equal acute and chronic toxicity to a winter generation of C. dipterum, whereas thiacloprid was approximately twice as toxic. The acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid was much higher for the C. dipterum summer generation than for the winter one. The acute toxicity differs by a factor of 20 for the 96-h 50% effective concentration (EC50) and by a factor of 5.4 for the chronic 28-d EC50. Temperature had only a slight effect on the sensitivity of C. dipterum to imidacloprid because we only found a factor of 1.7 difference in the 96-h EC50 between tests performed at 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C. The difference in sensitivity between summer and overwintering generations was also found for 3 other insect species. The results indicate that if the use and environmental fate of the 3 neonicotinoids are comparable, replacing imidacloprid by another neonicotinoid might not reduce the environmental impact on the mayfly nymph C. dipterum. The results also show the importance of reporting which generation is tested because sensitivity values of insects in the summer might be underestimated by the experiments performed with neonicotinoids and an overwintering population.

TI  - Connecting thermal performance curve variation to the genotype: a multivariate QTL approach
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 155-168
AB  - Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are continuous reaction norms that describe the relationship between organismal performance and temperature and are useful for understanding trade-offs involved in thermal adaptation. Although thermal trade-offs such as those between generalists and specialists or between hot- and cold-adapted phenotypes are known to be genetically variable and evolve during thermal adaptation, little is known of the genetic basis to TPCs - specifically, the loci involved and the directionality of their effects across different temperatures. To address this, we took a multivariate approach, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for locomotor activity TPCs in the fly, Drosophila serrata, using a panel of 76 recombinant inbred lines. The distribution of additive genetic (co)variance in the mapping population was remarkably similar to the distribution of mutational (co)variance for these traits. We detected 11 TPC QTL in females and 4 in males. Multivariate QTL effects were closely aligned with the major axes genetic (co)variation between temperatures; most QTL effects corresponded to variation for either overall increases or decreases in activity with a smaller number indicating possible trade-offs between activity at high and low temperatures. QTL representing changes in curve shape such as the generalist-specialist' trade-off, thought key to thermal adaptation, were poorly represented in the data. We discuss these results in the light of genetic constraints on thermal adaptation.

VL  - 11

SP  - 14217-14230
AB  - The contribution of phenotypically plastic traits to evolution depends on the degree of environmental influence on the target of selection (the phenotype) as well as the underlying genetic structure of the trait and plastic response. Likewise, maternal effects can help or hinder evolution through affects to the response to selection. The sacoglossan sea slug Alderia willowi exhibits intraspecific variation for developmental mode (= poecilogony) that is environmentally modulated with populations producing more yolk-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae during the summer, and more planktonic-feeding (planktotrophic) larvae in the winter. I found significant family-level variation in the reaction norms between 17 maternal families of A. willowi when reared in a split-brood design in low (16 ppt) versus high (32 ppt) salinity, conditions which mimic seasonal variation in salinity of natural populations. I documented a significant response to selection for lecithotrophic larvae in high and low salinity. The slope of the reaction norm was maintained following one generation of selection for lecithotrophy. When the maternal environment was controlled in the laboratory, I found significant maternal effects, which reduced the response to selection. These results suggest there is standing genetic variation for egg-mass type in A. willowi, but the ability of selection to act on that variation may depend on the environment in which the phenotype is expressed in preceding generations.

VL  - 365
IS  - 1555
SP  - 3161-3176
AB  - Climate change alters phenological relations between interacting species. We might expect the historical baseline, or starting-point, for such effects to be precise synchrony between the season at which a consumer most requires food and the time when its resources are most available. We synthesize evidence that synchrony was not the historical condition in two insect-plant interactions involving Edith's checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha), the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and their host plants. Initial observations of phenological mismatch in both systems were made prior to the onset of anthropogenically driven climate change. Neither species can detect the phenology of its host plants with precision. In both species, evolution of life history has involved compromise between maximizing fecundity and minimizing mortality, with the outcome being superficially maladaptive strategies in which many, or even most, individuals die of starvation through poor synchrony with their host plants. Where phenological asynchrony or mismatch with resources forms the starting point for effects of anthropogenic global warming, consumers are particularly vulnerable to impacts that exacerbate the mismatch. This vulnerability likely contributed to extinction of a well-studied metapopulation of Edith's checkerspot, and to the skewed geographical pattern of population extinctions underlying a northward and upward range shift in this species.

TI  - Sex-dependent effects of maternal stress: Stressed moms invest less in sons than daughters
VL  - 329
IS  - 6
SP  - 317-322
AB  - Multigenerational effects can have important and sex-dependent effects on offspring. Sex allocation theory predicts that females should differentially invest in sons and daughters depending on sex-specific fitness returns and costs of investment. Maternal stress-relevant (glucocorticoid) hormones may be one mechanism driving this effect. We investigated how maternal stress hormones differentially affected sons and daughters by manipulating levels of the glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), in gravid female eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) and quantifying reproductive investment and sex ratio of resulting clutches, and the mass, snout-vent length, and body condition of sons versus daughters at hatching. We found no effect of maternal CORT-treatment on the number or size of eggs laid or on the sex ratio of resulting offspring, but sons of CORT-treated mothers were shorter, lighter, and of poorer body condition at hatching than were sons of control mothers. We found no difference in size or condition of daughters with maternal treatment. Our results suggest that maternal stress, mediated by elevations in maternal CORT concentrations, can have sex-specific effects on offspring manifesting as lower investment in sons.

VL  - 90

SP  - 2447-2457
AB  - In this study, the effect of temperature on the growth of the European pepper moth, Duponchelia fovealis (Zeller). was assessed at five constant temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27 and 30 degrees C). The European pepper moth was observed to complete its developmental stages (from egg to adult) at all the temperatures evaluated. From the results, it was evident that temperature affected the rate and development time of all the growth stages, to a significant degree. The length in time of the embryonic, larval, pupal and total (egg-adult) stages was observed to drop as the temperature rose from 18 to 24 degrees C, but remained constant between 27 and 30 degrees C. The developmental time in the pre-pupal stage dropped between 18 and 30 degrees C. The European pepper moth takes 454 degree-days to complete development at 11.7 degrees C temperature threshold. The D. fovealis survival was thus inversely proportional to temperature over range of 18 to 30 degrees C. On assessing the number of annual generations for the five largest strawberry-producing municipalities in Espirito Santo State, an average of 5.5 generations per year was estimated. This is a first report of temperature on D. fovealis development.

TI  - Ruthenium immobilized on Al2O3 pellets as a catalyst for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis and methanolysis of sodium borohydride
VL  - 2
IS  - 5
SP  - 2073-2079
AB  - Ru immobilized Al2O3 pellets were synthesized as a catalyst for hydrogen generation in NaBH4 solutions. Under the Ru/Al2O3 catalysis, the hydrogen generation rate from the hydrolysis and methanolysis of NaBH4 in alkaline solution was explored as a function of NaBH4 concentration and temperature. Meanwhile, the borate byproducts derived from the NaBH4 hydrolysis were characterized by XRD and NMR. The results showed that the hydrogen generation rate depended on NaBH4 concentration for the hydrolysis, but did not for the methanolysis. 10 wt% NaBH4 hydrolysis containing 1 wt% NaOH catalyzed with 0.5 g Ru/Al2O3 could generate hydrogen with a rate of about 65.5 ml min(-1) g(-1). The productivity and activation energy of hydrogen generation from the NaBH4 hydrolysis were 93% and 41.8 kJ mol(-1), and from the NaBH4 methanolysis were 97% and 51.0 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The XRD and NMR analyses showed that the species from the hydrolysis byproducts varied with the NaBH4 concentration could be the borax (Na2B4O7 center dot H2O) and sodium borate hydrate (NaBO2 center dot H2O).

TI  - Somaclonal variation and improvement in chilling tolerance in rice: Changes in chilling-induced electrolyte leakage
VL  - 115
IS  - 4
SP  - 268-272
AB  - Excised leaves of four rice varieties, 'Facagro 57', 'Facagro 76', 'Kirundo 3', 'Kirundo 9', were chilled for six days at 10/5 degrees C day/night, along with 11 somaclonal families arising from three of these varieties, which had been selected over four generations for improved chilling tolerance. At the end of the chilling treatment, electrolyte leakage from leaf pieces was followed for 12 h and compared with an unchilled control. With unchilled leaves, no varietal differences nor a rise in Leakage over time were observed. Chilling induced higher leakages in all varieties, except in 'Kirundo 3' at the time of first measurement, and a continuous rise over time was found in all varieties. Varietal differences were detected, 'Kirundo 3' being the least affected, followed by 'Kirundo 9' and 'Facagro 76', and finally 'Facagro 57', which coincides with their ranking for chilling tolerance established through chilling survival tests. The leakages were generally lower in the somaclonal families than in the variety they originated from in 'Kirundo 9' and 'Facagro 76', while the opposite was observed in 'Kirundo 3'. The significance and usefulness of electrolyte leakage measurement for chilling tolerance screening, and the potentials of somaclonal variation for chilling tolerance improvement are discussed.

VL  - 18
SP  - 429-446
AB  - The social development, economic growth and booming population have caused aggravated water pollution, making clean water shortage an urgent issue to be solved. In recent decades, researchers have aroused upsurge studies of direct solar steam generation (DSSG) system for the production of clean water, in which solar thermal conversion materials (STCM) can strongly transform absorbed solar light into thermal energy, tremendously speeding the evaporation of water under sunlight irradiation. DSSG system has been considered an efficient, sustainable, low-cost and environment-friendly way to solve water shortage crisis of practical importance. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive summary of the recent development of DSSG system for clean water production. The introduction about categories of DSSG, principle of solar thermal conversion on STCM and efficiency calculation in DSSG system will first demonstrate the fast water evaporation mechanism. Then strategies for high performance water evaporation in DSSG are detailed including sunlight absorption regulation on STCM for efficient light utilization, system optimization of DSSC for minimizing the heat loss, water transport adjustment for adequate water supply and so on. Benefiting from the basic understanding and effective strategies of DSSG system, the quality of produced clean water, pollutants disposal in remaining water body and various designs of solar stills for high clean water productivity are further presented. Finally, we outline the current challenges and crucial issues of recent DSSG system, aiming to provide guidances and pointers to speed the development of DSSG in clean water production for practical applications.

TI  - Measuring the performance of thermal power firms in China via fuzzy Enhanced Russell measure model with undesirable outputs
VL  - 102
SP  - 237-245
AB  - Thermal power has accounted for the major part of the electricity generation over recent several decades in China. It plays an important role in supporting China's economic development while it also brings great pressure to the environment protection because of a large amount of pollution generated during its production. In order to solve or alleviate the environmental problem caused by thermal power firms, efficiency evaluation is the first important step. As thermal power firm is a complex system with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, usually including fuzzy data and undesirable outputs in the productions, in this paper, we build an integrated Enhanced Russell measure model based on data envelopment analysis for evaluating the performance of decision making units in the presence of the undesirable outputs in fuzzy circumstance. Then, this new model is applied to analyze the environmental performance and provide the benchmarks for the thermal power firms in China which can guide the decision makers to make suitable future production plans for improving their performance.

TI  - A productivity bottleneck in the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras): Early life-history processes and recruitment variability
VL  - 177
AB  - Exogenous anomalies induced by contemporary climate change may severely impact dynamics of early life stages of fish. Here, we modelled how growth rate and abundance of postflexion larvae, and recruitment of Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus membras) in the Parnu Bay, Gulf of Riga (GoR) may respond to shifting climate variables. Higher larval growth rates were aligned with later seasonal emergence of yolk-sac larvae, while lower abundance of postflexion larvae occurred in years of earlier seasonal seawater warming. Cooler temperatures (< 16 degrees C) in spring expanded the optimal thermal window for first-feeding herring larvae, attributable to the absence of early seasonal water temperature warming. Higher recruitment levels emerged in years of seasonally delayed warming and were associated with higher abundance of post flexion larvae. In recent decades, the trend towards earlier warming of the Baltic Sea in spring threatens to create a bottleneck to successful recruitment of herring. The existing paradigm that abundant Baltic herring year-classes occur only in the years following mild winters no longer stands as environmental conditions undergo rapid change. The relative contribution of Parnu Bay larval nursery areas to recruitment has diminished as the suitable thermal window has been dramatically reduced in recent decades. Evolving thermal dynamics in the GoR have developed relatively recently and in future present a bottleneck for herring production.

VL  - 80
IS  - 4
SP  - 370-385
AB  - Fifteen populations of Escherichia coli were propagated for 150 freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) cycles in order to study the phenotypic and genetic changes that evolve under these stressful conditions. Here we present the phenotypic differences between the evolved lines and their progenitors as measured by competition experiments and growth curves. Three FTG lines evolved from an ancestral strain that was previously used to start a long-term evolution experiment, while the other 12 FTG lines are derived from clones that had previously evolved for 20,000 generations at constant 37 degrees C. Competition experiments indicate that the former FTG group improved their mean fitness under the FTG regime by about 90% relative to their progenitor, while the latter FTG group gained on average about 60% relative to their own progenitors. These increases in fitness result from both improved survival during freezing and thawing and more rapid recovery to initiate exponential growth after thawing. This shorter lag phase is specific to recovery after freezing and thawing. Future work will seek to identify the mutations responsible for evolutionary adaptation to the FTG environment and use them to explore the physiological mechanisms that allow increased survival and more rapid recovery.

TI  - Adult fish predation on freshwater limnetic fish larvae: A mesocosm experiment
VL  - 130
IS  - 2
SP  - 189-203
AB  - We demonstrated that predation by adult bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and white crappies Pomoxis annularis may be a major source of mortality for freshwater larval fish. In 5.3-m(3)-mesocosms, we compared the survival of larval bluegill prey (19 larvae/m(3); mean standard length [SL], 8.6 mm; range, 3-22 mm) in the presence of adult bluegills, adult white crappies, or adult izzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum with the survival of predator-free controls. The duration of the experiments was 3.7 h for bluegills, 3.2 h for white crappies, 5.5 h for gizzard shad, and 4.3 h for the predator-free controls. Larval fish survival in both the bluegill and white crappie predator treatments was lower than that of the predator-free controls, whereas larval fish survival in the gizzard shad treatments did not differ from that of the controls. The instantaneous hourly mortality rate attributable to predation was 0.11 for bluegill (9.8 larvae consumed/predator each hour) and 0.05 for white crappie (4.8 larvae consumed/predator each hour). Larval fish mortality in bluegill treatments was related positively to water clarity. Furthermore, bluegills were size-selective predators, with neutral selection for small larvae (<8 mm SL), positive selection for intermediate larvae (8-12 mm SL), and negative selection for large larvae (>12 mm SL). Despite a slight trend towards positive selection of small larvae, white crappies were not size-selective predators. Our concurrent stomach content analysis of predators failed to accurately quantify predation rates or detect any consumption of small larvae, which partly explains the dearth of published evidence linking adult fish predators to larval fish prey in freshwater systems. Thus, predation on limnetic freshwater fish larvae by adult fish (both cannibalism and predation on other species) may be a major mortality source that varies with predator type, larval size, and water clarity. These findings suggest that in addition to competition, predation may greatly affect larval survival in freshwater fishes.

TI  - Thermal Requirements of Ooencyrtus submetallicus (Hym.: Encyrtidae) and Telenomus podisi (Hym.: Platygastridae) Parasitizing Euschistus heros Eggs (Hem.: Pentatomidae)
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Simple Summary The brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, is the most abundant species infesting Brazilian soybean crops, causing significant yield losses. This stink bug is controlled with chemical insecticides, although the use of biological control with the egg parasitoids Ooencyrtus submetallicus and Telenomus podisi is increasing. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the development of O. submetallicus and T. podisi in E. heros eggs at different temperatures, and to estimate the number of annual generations for seven representative soybean-producing regions in Brazil. In the comparative biology study, the sex ratio and individuals per egg were higher for O. submetallicus in all regions. In the study of thermal requirements, the temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 33 & DEG;C were tested. The base temperature (Tb) for O. submetallicus and T. podisi was found to be 9.3 and 6.7 & DEG;C, and the thermal constant (K) was 336.9 and 272.7 degree-days, respectively. The average number of annual generations was estimated from the average temperatures of the last ten years in each region; based on these results, both parasitoids presented a higher number of generations than the host in all regions. O. submetallicus and T. podisi have the same ability to parasitize and develop in the eggs of E. heros under the conditions studied; in addition, both exhibited development and satisfactory parasitism at temperatures between 19 and 31 & DEG;C. The development of the two parasitoids was faster than E. heros, and the number of generations was higher for the seven studied localities. Temperature is one of the abiotic factors that strongly influences the biology and behavior of insects. In this study, we assessed the development of egg parasitoids Ooencyrtus submetallicus and Telenomus podisi parasitizing Euschistus heros eggs at different temperatures, and estimated the average number of generations for seven representative soybean-producing regions in Brazil. A comparative biology study was conducted, where the percentage of parasitism and emergence, life cycle duration (egg-adult), and longevity were found to be similar between O. submetallicus and T. podisi. The sex ratio and the number of individuals emerged from parasitized egg were higher in O. submetallicus in all regions. In the study of thermal requirements, temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 33 & DEG;C were tested. O. submetallicus and T. podisi developed at temperatures between 16 and 31 & DEG;C. The base temperature (Tb) for O. submetallicus and T. podisi was 9.3 and 6.7 & DEG;C, respectively; the thermal constant (K) was 336.9 and 272.7 degree-days, respectively. The estimated average number of annual generations of both parasitoids was higher than the host. O. submetallicus and T. podisi have the same ability to parasitize and develop in eggs of E. heros under the conditions studied. Both parasitoids exhibited satisfactory development and parasitism at temperatures between 19 and 31 & DEG;C. The development of both parasitoids was faster than their host, and the number of generations was higher for the seven studied localities.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A MICRO-SCALE ORC-BASED CHP ENERGY SYSTEM FOR DOMESTIC APPLICATIONS
SP  - 323-332
AB  - Because of the renewed interest in renewable energy as well as increased emphasis on alternative technologies, micropower-generating systems have attracted considerable research interest over the last decade. However, micro-scale power generation for low grade heat recovery applications, i.e. as low as 1-3 kW - for domestic use, are characterized by very low efficiencies and relatively high specific cost. For economic viability, these factors make it imperative that the heat source remains "free", such as solar or geothermal energy. In this paper, a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is presented. The small-scale ORC module was built and tested at San Diego State University lab, aimed at producing electricity and hot water from ultra-low grade heat source that can be tapped from solar collectors and low temperature exhaust heat. The system was built for economic viability and flexibility, tailored for a domestic use. The tests demonstrated that the system offered CHP capability, with electric and thermal power output suitable for a domestic application. It also offered high operational flexibility, since the scroll expander could work with a high temperature range, accommodating an even-significant drop of the heat source temperature. Therefore, it can be conveniently used to capture solar and low-temperature energy sources. The system could be produced at an overall cost of less than $3,000 (USD 2010).

TI  - Plastic and Evolutionary Gene Expression Responses Are Correlated in European Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) Subpopulations Adapted to Different Thermal Environments
VL  - 107
IS  - 1
SP  - 82-89
AB  - Understanding how populations adapt to changing environmental conditions is a long-standing theme in evolutionary biology. Gene expression changes have been recognized as an important driver of local adaptation, but relatively little is known regarding the direction of change and in particular, about the interplay between plastic and evolutionary gene expression. We have previously shown that the gene expression profiles of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) populations inhabiting different thermal environments include both plastic and evolutionary components. However, whether the plastic and evolutionary responses were in the same direction was not investigated in detail, nor was the identity of the specific genes involved. In this study, we show that the plastic changes in protein expression in response to different temperatures are highly correlated with the evolutionary response in grayling subpopulations adapted to different thermal environments. This finding provides preliminary evidence that the plastic response most likely facilitates adaptation during the early phases of colonization of thermal environments. The proteins that showed significant changes in expression level between warm and cold temperature treatments were mostly related to muscle development, which is consistent with earlier findings demonstrating muscle mass differentiation between cold and warm grayling populations.

TI  - Thermal Optimization Formulation Strategies for Multi-Constraints Electronic Devices Placement on PCB
SP  - 2440-+
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for thermal optimization formulation strategies for multi-heat generation of integrated circuit (IC) on printed circuit board (PCB). Weighted-sum approach for multi-objective genetic algorithm (WMOGA) with formulated initial placement and multi-constraints parameters (FIPMCP) are presented. FIPMCP is used for the components selection and components to PCB placement mapping procedures for random initial population. The objectives are to optimize thermal distribution f(T) of electronic components on PCB and the PCB area f(A) needed simultaneously. For multi-objective optimization process, non-dominated optimal solutions and the best fitness WMOGA over iterations are plotted for both cases in order to obtain the best PCB optimal design solution. The results show that the best solution of f(T),f(A) and F(T,A) are minimized by 1.80%, 8.54% and 4.97% respectively.

TI  - LARVAL RESPONSE TO PARENTAL LOW pH EXPOSURE IN THE PACIFIC OYSTER CRASSOSTREA GIGAS
VL  - 38
IS  - 3
SP  - 743-750
AB  - As negative effects of ocean acidification are experienced by coastal ecosystems, there is a growing trend to investigate the effect ocean acidification has on multiple generations. Parental exposure to ocean acidification has been shown to induce larval carryover effects, but whether acute exposure to a stressor as an adult can influence the larval generation long after the stress has been removed has yet to be tested. To assess how a temporary exposure to experimental ocean acidification affects the ecologically and commercially relevant Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, adult oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 +/- 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 +/- 0.02) conditions for 7 wk. Oysters were then held for 8 wk in ambient conditions, and subsequently reproductively conditioned for 4 wk at ambient pH. After conditioning, the oysters were strip-spawned to create four families based on maternal and paternal ocean acidification exposure. The number of D-hinge larvae was counted 18 h postfertilization. A sex-specific brood stock response was observed, where female exposure to low pH conditions resulted in fewer D-hinge larvae. This study demonstrates that the effects of ocean acidification can last beyond the time from when the environmental perturbation is experienced. Broadening the understanding of environmental memory will be valuable when considering organismal ability to persist in the face of environmental change.

TI  - Oseltamivir Expands Quasispecies of Influenza Virus through Cell-to-cell Transmission
VL  - 5
AB  - The population of influenza virus consists of a huge variety of variants, called quasispecies, due to error-prone replication. Previously, we reported that progeny virions of influenza virus become infected to adjacent cells via cell-to-cell transmission pathway in the presence of oseltamivir. During cell-to-cell transmission, viruses become infected to adjacent cells at high multiplicity since progeny virions are enriched on plasma membrane between infected cells and their adjacent cells. Co-infection with viral variants may rescue recessive mutations with each other. Thus, it is assumed that the cell-to-cell transmission causes expansion of virus quasispecies. Here, we have demonstrated that temperature-sensitive mutations remain in progeny viruses even at non-permissive temperature by co-infection in the presence of oseltamivir. This is possibly due to a multiplex infection through the cell-to-cell transmission by the addition of oseltamivir. Further, by the addition of oseltamivir, the number of missense mutation introduced by error-prone replication in segment 8 encoding NS1 was increased in a passage-dependent manner. The number of missense mutation in segment 5 encoding NP was not changed significantly, whereas silent mutation was increased. Taken together, we propose that oseltamivir expands influenza virus quasispecies via cell-to-cell transmission, and may facilitate the viral evolution and adaptation.

TI  - Laboratory studies of the effect of temperature on growth, moulting and reproduction in the co-occurring mysids Neomysis integer and Praunus flexuosus
VL  - 235
SP  - 177-188
AB  - The growth and reproduction of 2 co-occurring mysids (Neomysis integer Leach, 1814 and Praunus flexuosus F. Muller, 1776) were investigated against the background of their life cycle with individual-based experiments in the laboratory at 2 temperatures (10 and 15degreesC). The response of postmarsupial growth in relation to age in N. integer followed a sigmoid curve, based on an increase in both intermoult periods and growth factors. Maturity occurred after 15 to 16 moults and an age of 110 d at 10degreesC. At 15degreesC, the mean age was 45 d and mean length was 8 mm at maturity. Up to this stage they had moulted 9 to 10 times, In adults, growth rates decreased with increasing length. In post-larval and juvenile individuals of N. integer (3 to 7 mm), growth strongly depended on temperature as shown by high temperature coefficients (Q(10) = 4.0 to 7.4). The impact of temperature, on the growth of P. flexuosus was markedly different, the intermoult periods decreased while the growth factors increased with increasing temperature. At 15degreesC they needed 3.5 mo to mature and averaged 16 to 18 mm. P. flexuosus needed more than twice as long as N. integer to reach maturity, long enough for 2 generations of N. integer. In addition, temperature coefficients were markedly lower in juvenile P. flexuosus (Q(10) = 1.0 to 3.1) than in juvenile N. integer, The reproduction rate of N, integer was twice that of P. flexuosus. Incubation time for P. flexuosus was longer, fewer post-larval individuals emerged, and juveniles were 1 to 1.5 mm longer than juvenile N. integer. There were clear differences in the sequence of generations of N. integer and P. flexuosus, based on the development, time to maturity, number, and length of offspring, These interspecific differences in growth and reproduction enable a better insight into the life history strategies of N. integer and P. flexuosus and help to interpret the different distribution patterns, population structures, and the coexistence of these 2 species.

TI  - Anticipatory parental effects in a subtropical lizard in response to experimental warming
VL  - 15
AB  - Parental effects may produce adaptive or maladaptive plasticity that either facilitates persistence or increases the extinction risk of species and populations in a changing climate. However, empirical evidence of transgenerational adaptive plastic responses to climate change is still scarce. Here we conducted thermal manipulation experiments with a factorial design in a Chinese lacertid lizard (Takydromus septentrionalis) to identify the fitness consequences of parental effects in response to climate warming. Compared to present climate conditions, a simulated warming climate significantly advanced the timing of oviposition, depressed the immune capability of post-partum females, and decreased the hatching success of embryos, but did not affect female reproductive output (clutch size and egg mass). These results indicate that maternal warming negatively affects female health, and embryonic hatchability. More interestingly, we found that offspring from parents exposed to warming environments survived well under a simulated warming climate, but not under a present climate scenario. Accordingly, our study demonstrates anticipatory parental effects in response to a warming climate in an ectothermic vertebrate. However, the fitness consequences of this parental effect will depend on future climate change scenarios.

AB  - 1. When first instar nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphidiae) were maintained in long-term cultures (> 6 months) at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, the LT50 decreased from -8 and -8.8 degrees C to -16.0 and -13.5 degrees C, respectively. 2. When aphids from the 20 degrees C culture were transferred to 10 degrees C, there was a progressive increase in cold tolerance through three successive generations. Transfer of newly moulted pre-reproductive adults reared at 10 degrees C for three generations back to 20 degrees C resulted in a rapid loss of cold hardiness in their nymphal offspring. 3. In all generations reared at 10 degrees C, first born nymphs were more cold hardy than those born later in the birth sequence. The LT50 of nymphs produced on the first day of reproduction in the first, second and third generations maintained at 10 degrees C were -14.8, -17.0 and -16.6 degrees C, respectively. Thereafter, nymphal cold hardiness decreased over the subsequent 14 days of reproduction in each generation at 10 degrees C with mean LT50 values of -10.3, -12.6 and -14.8 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, the cold tolerance of first born nymphs of aphids reared continuously at 20 degrees C did not differ in comparison with later born siblings. The LT50 of adult aphids was also unaffected by ageing. 4. The ecological relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the overwintering survival of aphids such as S. avenae.

TI  - A numerical analysis of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle power plant for power generation from low-temperature geothermal sources
VL  - 180
SP  - 834-848
AB  - The Kalina cycle is believed to be one of the most promising technologies for power generation from low temperature heat sources such as geothermal energy. So far, most Kalina cycle power plants are designed with a working fluid mixture having a fixed composition, and thus normally operate at a fixed condensing temperature. However, the ambient temperature (i.e., heat sink) varies over a large range as the season changes over a year, particularly in continental climates. Recently, a new concept, i.e., composition adjustable Kalina cycle, was proposed to develop power plants that can match their condensing temperature with the changing ambient conditions, aiming at improving the cycle's overall thermal efficiency. However, no detailed analysis of its implementation and the potential benefits under various climate conditions has been reported. For this reason, this paper carried out a comprehensive numerical research on its implementation and performance analysis under several different climate conditions. A mathematical model is firstly established to simulate the working principle of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle, based on which a numerical program is then developed to analyse the cycle's performance under various climate conditions. The developed numerical model is verified with some published data. The dynamic composition adjustment in response to the changing ambient temperature is simulated to evaluate its effect on the plant's performance over a year. The results show that a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle could achieve higher annual-average thermal efficiency than a conventional one with a fixed mixture composition. However, such an improvement of thermal efficiency strongly depends on the heat source temperature, climate conditions, etc. The composition-adjusting system introduces extra capital and operation costs. The economic viability of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle power plant depends on the balance between these extra costs and the increase of thermal efficiency. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF RESISTANCE TO HIGH-TEMPERATURE IN ECTOTHERMS
VL  - 142
SP  - S21-S46
AB  - Body temperature influences the performance and fitness of ectotherms. How thermal sensitivity responds to selection for resistance to high temperature is broadly relevant in evolutionary physiology and also has practical implications. We review several complementary approaches to studying the evolution of thermal sensitivity. First, we analyze comparative data that illustrate the historical evolution of thermal sensitivity of locomotion in iguanid lizards. Taxa that experience high body temperatures in nature have evolved high optimal temperatures for sprinting. Critical thermal maxima are coadapted with optimal temperatures but not with critical thermal minima. Thus some but not all aspects of thermal sensitivity are coadapted. Second, we describe selection experiments that help reveal potential genetic constraints on the future evolution of thermal sensitivity in Drosophila. Thermal sensitivity responds rapidly both to laboratory natural selection and artificial selection, and tolerance of extreme high temperature appears genetically correlated with performance at intermediate temperature. Third, applying a recent model by Lynch and Lande, we describe how the shape of thermal performance curves may affect evolutionary responses of thermal sensitivity to a gradual shift in the thermal environment. Our theoretical predictions depend crucially on the relationship-between the genetic variation in optimal temperature and the performance breadth. If genetic variation is independent of breadth, then populations with an intermediate value of performance breadth will tolerate the greatest rate of environmental change. Moreover, if a trade-off exists between maximum performance and breadth of performance, then thermal specialists will be favored over thermal generalists in a rapidly changing environment. On the other hand, if genetic variation increases with increasing breadth, then populations of thermal generalists will tolerate the greatest rates of environmental change.

AB  - Outdoor personal thermal comfort is of substantial significance to ameliorate the health conditions of pedestrian and outdoor laborer. However, the uncontrollable sunlight, substantial radiative loss, and intense temperature fluctuations in the outdoor environment present majestic challenges to outdoor personal thermal management. Here, we report an eco-friendly passive nanostructured textile which harvests energy from the sun and the outer space for optional localized heating and cooling. Compared to conventional heating/cooling textiles like black/white cotton, its heating/cooling mode enables a skin simulator temperature increase/decrease of 8.1 degrees C/6 degrees C, respectively, under sunlight exposure. Meanwhile, the temperature gradient created between the textile and human skin allows a continuous electricity generation with thermoelectric modules. Owing to the exceptional outdoor thermoregulation ability, this Janus textile is promising to help maintain a comfortable microclimate for individuals in outdoor environment and provide a platform for pervasive power generation.

TI  - Numerical analysis and machine learning for battery thermal performance cooled with different fluids
AB  - A system of parallelly placed Li-ion batteries placed at different spacings and cooled by different coolants is analyzed. The prime focus is on the effect of spacings between the batteries on battery thermal performance. The temperature and heat flux at the coolant and battery interface is taken as continuous. Coolants used belong to thermal oils, gases, conventional oils, liquid metals, and nanofluids. Finite volume method-based numerical analysis is performed upon validation with experimental work reported in the literature, by developing a code in the C language. The simultaneous effect of battery aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, Reynolds number (Re-f), and heat generation at different battery spacings for each coolant on average Nusselt number (Nu(H)) is explored. An analytical model is developed and artificial neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) prediction of Nu(H) is carried out later. Battery aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, and heat generation for any given coolant do not affect the Nu(H). However, the coolant Prandtl number at different battery spacings has a prominent effect on Nu(H). Thermal oils and liquid metal coolants show a significant and non-linear variation of Nu(H) with increased battery spacings. The effect of Re-f on Nu(H) was linear as expected for all the coolants at different battery spacings. However, Nu(H) variations for liquid metal at different Re-f were highly non-linear. The mathematical model developed and ANFIS regression analysis indicated a very comfortable prediction of Nu(H). The R-squared value of the mathematical model is up to 0.98 while from ANFIS it is up to 0.985 showing a very good fitness of these models.

VL  - 17

SP  - 709-716
AB  - Breeding and rearing the offspring through successive generations are mandatory in order to study evolutionary responses to anthropogenic impact in marine organisms. However, fish offer a limited number of marine model species that allow performing multigenerational experimental approaches. Here, we propose a novel breeding and rearing experimental model based on the marbled goby Pomatoschistus marmoratus (Risso 1810) which is representative of small (up to 65 mm total length), benthic species with a short life cycle. We devised a 'full-sib/half-sib' breeding design, and the resulting offspring were reared in captivity using a complex feeding protocol and a creative design of the tanks. Three families survived up to 160 days post-hatching (dph); one was reared at 24 degrees C and two at 18 degrees C. The families reared at 18 degrees C reached sexual maturity and spawned. The size range at sexual maturity of individuals reared in captivity was consistent with the one observed in nature. The possibility to complete the entire life cycle, from hatching to sexual maturity and spawning in P. marmoratus offers great perspectives for experimental evolution and quantitative genetics studies aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes in response to global changes.

AB  - The generation of electricity from solar thermal source has continued to garner more attention due to the very attractive environmental performance, the applicability to small distributed users and as alternative to the fossil fuels power generation. Indeed, solar thermal energy, through the coupling with ORC systems, becomes fit for electric power generation as well and, with a proper thermal storage, can deliver more equivalent hours than other residential systems. The paper analyses, by means of system modelling simulation, a small solar power plant composed by a CPC heat pipe solar collector device feeding a thermal storage, an ORC and an absorber unit. Beside the analysis of configuration and design, this paper proposes an economic analysis taking into consideration the applicable incentive. The evaluation highlights the economic viability of the proposed system and tries to define a roadmap to optimize results consisting in acceptable PBT and positive NPV.

AB  - The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has been actively involved in development of biomass gasifier system for thermal and power generation use. Though the basic science of gasification is well established, there have not many efforts in the past on product development. By continuous interaction with users, silk experts and consultants, TERI could able to develop a gasifier based silk reeling oven. A major thrust on this development work was to evolve marketable product by continued efforts to gain an insight of the actual process and user feedback through an extended presence and interaction at field level, and then translating this experience in product design. The present paper gives a summary of design, development and testing of gasifier based cottage basin system for cocoon cooking in silk reeling industry in order to achieve higher fuel efficiency and increase productivity of the process. The paper describes in detail the approach of different technology development stages, its testing both at laboratory and field and economic viability of the system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Cost-minimised design of a highly renewable heating network for fossil-free future
VL  - 152
SP  - 613-626
AB  - This research presents technical and cost-minimised design to decarbonise the heating network by using large-scale heat pump and thermal heat storage. In this paper, real hourly heat-consumption and heat production cost data for the city of Aarhus, Denmark are used for calculating techno-economic feasibility of coupling the heating network with electrical grid. An optimum solution is suggested for the entire network with least amount of backup generation capacity, thermal heat storage capacity, natural gas boiler capacity and levelised cost of energy. Aarhus constitutes 5% of the Denmark's total heat demand and 4% of electrical load demand. This can be fulfilled with 160 MW of rated wind generation capacity, 35 MW of solar PV generation capacity, 45 MW of backup generation capacity, 221 MW of natural gas boiler capacity and 3.4 GWh of thermal heat storage capacity. The levelised cost of energy shows that, the coupling between the electrical grid and heating sector reduces the cost by more than 50% to 45 /MWh. However, the cost-minimised design is possible with wind/solar mix of 85% and renewable energy penetration of 100%. Sensitivity analysis concedes that, the 100% decarbonisation of heating sector relies heavily upon the cost assumed for wind generation and solar PV generation, instead of the operation and maintenance cost for heat pump. Furthermore, the reduction in cost for wind generation and solar PV generation leads to the decrease in levelised cost of energy. Whereas, the reduction in cost for heat pump, thermal heat storage capacity and natural gas boiler capacity leads to an increase in renewable energy penetration. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that, increasing thermal heat storage capacity and the cost of selling excess renewable energy does not have major impact upon the levelised cost of energy and can be instrumental for the economic viability of fossil-free future.

AB  - The growth responses of Yersinia enterocolitica as affected by NaCl concentration, pH value and storage temperature were studied in laboratory medium. Growth curves at concentrations of NaCl in the range 0.5-6.5% (w/v), pH Values in the range 4.0-7.0 and storage temperatures in the range 5-30 degrees C were fitted using the Gompertz routine and the derived parameters modelled. Growth curves could then be regenerated for any set of conditions within the matrix studied and values for growth rate, generation time, lag time and time to 1000-fold increase predicted. The model was validated against data from the literature and was found to give realistic estimates for generation time in media and a range of foods including meat and meat products, milk, eggs, fish and tofu. All predictions were consistently 'fail-safe'.

TI  - A method for techno-economic analysis of supercritical carbon dioxide cycles for new generation nuclear power plants
VL  - 226
SP  - 372-383
AB  - The energy generation industry faces new challenges and requirements. The fourth generation of nuclear power plants is developed to meet the future clean energy demand by 2030. The supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton closed cycle features compactness and high efficiency, combined with short construction time, standing for higher profitability when compared to current steam cycles. In this article, a method for assessing overall viability of direct and indirect carbon dioxide cycles is described. This method comprises both thermodynamic and economic analyses. Thermodynamic and economic models have been developed to assess several cycle designs in terms of overall viability that includes thermodynamic performance and financial outcome. Each cycle has been calculated through an iterative process that takes into account the variation of the properties of the working fluid and returns temperatures, pressure, efficiency, and power generation for the given design characteristics. The economic model, on the other hand, includes the calculation of overnight cost, which is a function of the cycle choice, through the cost of the components. Furthermore, plant profitability is calculated over a given period, which depends on both overnight cost and power plant efficiency. The method has been applied on an indicative parametric analysis of two S-CO2 cycles (direct and indirect) where the capability of identifying optimum areas has been case shown. In terms of overall pressure ratio, it was found that a thermodynamically optimized cycle would not coincide with an economically optimized one, due to the effect of component costing. On the other hand, turbine entry temperature appeared to considerably improve both power output and economic outcome, even though a maximum value is dictated by thermal and mechanical resistances of materials. In overall, even though power generation train is only a subsystem in a nuclear plant, it has been demonstrated that thermodynamic cycle design can have a significant impact on maximizing the earning capacity of the plant, especially through the implementation of a novel highly dense fluid, such as the S-CO2, which bears the potential of high compactness.

TI  - Biomass briquette manufacturing system model for environment
VL  - 686
SP  - 859-865
AB  - India depends mainly on indigenous coal for its power generation and imported oil for its transportation needs. Most of the energy needs of rural poor are met by burning wood and other biomass in the least efficient manner adding to the GHG emissions. A comprehensive system of utilizing biomass energy to replace or supplement coal usage in power generation and industrial heating systems is a pressing need. Converting rural population to better fuels or efficient biomass burners will also help in reducing the growth of GHG emissions. An efficient network of Biomass Briquette Manufacturing system could help addressing most of these issues in a sustainable manner. The briquettes made from biomass can be mixed with coal for co-firing, used in gasifiers to produce syngas used for small scale power plants established in remote regions. This paper discusses the elements and needs of briquetting system and proposes ways to improve the productivity of the biomass briquetting system by eliminating bottlenecks and improving processes.

TI  - Microbial Mats in the Mesoproterozoic Carbonates of the North China Platform and Their Potential for Hydrocarbon Generation
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SP  - 549-566
AB  - The well-preserved Mesoproterozoic succession in the North China platform consists mainly of three lithological associations including peritidal quartz sandstone, shallow marine and lagoonal dark to black shales, and shallow epeiric carbonates, with a total thickness of up to 8 000 m. In addition to well-documented microplants, macroalgae, and microbial buildups, abundant microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) and mat-related sediments have been recognized in these rocks. Intensive microbial mat layers and MISS are especially well preserved in the carbonates of the upper Gaoyuzhuang (ca. 1.5 Ga) and lower Wumishan (ca. 1.45 Ga) formations, indicating diversified microbial activities and a high organic production. In these petrified biomats, putative microbial fossils (both coccoidal and filamentous) and framboidal pyrites have been identified. The abundance of authigenic carbonate minerals in the host rocks, such as, acicular aragonites, rosette barites, radial siderites, ankerites, and botryoidal carbonate cements, suggests authigenic carbonate precipitation from anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) under anoxic/euxinic conditions. Warm climate and anoxic/euxinic conditions in the Mesoproterozoic oceans may have facilitated high microbial productivity and organic burial in sediments. Although authigenic carbonate cements may record carbonate precipitation from anaerobic methane oxidation, gas blister (or dome) structures may indicate gas release from active methanogenesis during shallow burial. Bituminous fragments in mat-related carbonates also provide evidence for hydrocarbon generation. Under proper conditions, the Mesoproterozoic mat-rich carbonates will have the potential for hydrocarbon generation and serve as source rocks. On the basis of petrified biomats, a rough estimation suggests that the Mesoproterozoic carbonates of the North China platform might have a hydrocarbon production potential in the order of 10 x 10(8) t.

VL  - 21

SP  - 1418-1427
AB  - The maintenance of genetic variation for infection-related traits is often attributed to coevolution between hosts and parasites, but it can also be maintained by environmental variation if the relative fitness of different genotypes changes with environmental variation. To gain insight into how infection-related traits are sensitive to environmental variation, we exposed a single host genotype of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna to four parasite isolates (which we assume to represent different genotypes) of its naturally co-occurring parasite Pasteuria ramosa at 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found that the cost to the host of becoming infected varied with temperature, but the magnitude of this cost did not depend on the parasite isolate. Temperature influenced parasite fitness traits; we found parasite genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions for parasite transmission stage production, suggesting the potential for temperature variation to maintain genetic variation in this trait. Finally, we tested for temperature-dependent relationships between host and parasite fitness traits that form a key component of models of virulence evolution, and we found them to be stable across temperatures.

TI  - RELATIVE FITNESS OF HERBICIDE-RESISTANT AND SUSCEPTIBLE BIOTYPES OF WEEDS
VL  - 75
SP  - 37-49
AB  - In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of herbicide-resistant weed species (over 100), as well as an increase in the types of herbicides to which resistance has evolved. This paper reviews evidence for differential fitness of herbicide-resistant and susceptible biotypes. Fitness estimates are required to produce reliable population models. Fitness measures describe the potential evolutionary success of a genotype based on survival, competitive ability and ultimately reproductive success. Differences in relative fitness between resistant and susceptible biotypes are usually inferred from measures of relative plant productivity or competitiveness. For triazine-resistant weed species, studies have indicated that resistant plants were generally less fit than susceptible plants, although exceptions did exist. Although less data are available on the fitness of plants resistant to non-triazine herbicides, information is summarized for sulfonylureas, substituted ureas, dinitroanilines, paraquat, diclofop, and organic arsenicals. No consistent differences in relative fitness were observed for non-triazine resistant and susceptible biotypes. In general, studies have indicated that the relative fitness of susceptible and resistant biotypes of a single species depends upon biological conditions, including genotype and population variation, intra- and inter-biotype competition, and environmental conditions such as temperature, light quality, and management practices. Future needs for relative fitness studies are discussed.

TI  - A new systematic synthesis of ultimate nickel nanocatalysts for compact hydrogen generation
VL  - 5
IS  - 7
SP  - 1218-1223
AB  - Nickel (Ni)-based materials have been shown as good catalysts for hydrogen production by steam reforming of methane, but the hydrogen productivity has been restricted due to agglomeration among particles on Ni loaded catalysts. A new strategy is demonstrated by which to produce ultimate nickel nanocatalysts with high particle dispersion and high metal loading by using automated and systematic synthesis tools based on a simple melt-infiltration process and thermal treatment. The systematic sequence can yield highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (4.5 nm) with high metal loading (25 wt%) on porous alumina (u-Ni/Al2O3) as an ultimate catalyst.

AB  - Fertility schedules of Unaspis yanonensis on citrus leaves were investigated from 1962 to 1971 for the first generation and from 1964 to 1971 for the second generation, at the Okitsu Branch of the Fruit Tree Research Station in Shizuoka Prefecture. The fertility curves were commonly characterized by a first major peak and a few subsequent minor peaks, although their shapes differed from year to year. Models estimating these fertility curves of each generation were constructed in relation to the fluctuations in average daily temperature, on the assumption that the curve was composed of two peaks, i.e., bimodal. Estimated curves were well fitted to observed ones.

VL  - 25
IS  - 1
SP  - 33-39
AB  - Genetic mechanisms of increase, persistence, decrease and decline of major acaricide resistance in citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McG.), were studied. Dicofol resistance in P. citri was mainly due to a single, incompletely recessive major gene. The result of the experiments on fitness indicated that the reproduction rate of the resistant strain was lower than that of the susceptible one, in particular under a high temperature condition (30-degrees-C) or under a special feeding condition such as seriously damaged leaves of host trees. This was caused by a lower rate of egg production in the resistant mites. The dicofol susceptibility in a mite population originally composed of a 1:1 mixture of resistant and susceptible strains from the same origin was examined in 17 generations at 25-degrees-C. After 13 generations, susceptibility of the mixed population increased remarkably. The result indicates that the resistant mites (RR) have lower fitness values than the susceptible mites (SS, RS) under either favorable (25-degrees-C) or unfavorable conditions for reproduction of the spider mites in an acaricide-free environment. Amitraz resistance was due to a single, incompletely dominant major gene. The values of fitness of benzomate and amitraz resistant mites were almost equal to those of susceptible mites in an acaricide-free environment.

TI  - Conversion of steel mill waste into nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) particles for hydrogen generation via metal-steam reforming
VL  - 33

SP  - 1232-1242
AB  - The proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most preferred and efficient energy conversion devices for automotive applications but demand high purity hydrogen which comes at a premium price. The currently pursued hydrogen generation methods suffer from issues such as, low efficiency, high cost, environmental non-benignity, and, in some cases, commercial non-viability. Many of these drawbacks can be overcome by resorting to metal-steam reforming using iron from steel industry's mill-scale waste. A novel solution-based room temperature technique using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent has been developed that produces highly active nanoscale (30-40nm) iron particles. A slightly modified version of this technique using a surfactant and water-oil microemulsion resulted in the formation of 5 nm spherical Fe particles. By using hydrazine as an inexpensive and more stable (compared to NaBH4) reductant, body centered cubic iron particles with edge dimensions similar to 5nm were obtained under mild solvothermal conditions in ethanol. The nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) powder showed improved kinetics and greater propensity for hydrogen generation. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 8

SP  - 1905-1922
AB  - Presently lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the dominant Li-salt used in commercial rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite anode and a 3-4 V cathode material. While LiPF6 is not the ideal Li-salt for every important electrolyte property, it has a uniquely suitable combination of properties (temperature range, passivation, conductivity, etc.) rendering it the overall best Li-salt for LIBs. However, this may not necessarily be true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries, for example lithium-metal (Li-metal), lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2), and lithium-sulfur (Li-S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical and chemical reactions and conditions within such cells. This review explores the critical role Li-salts play in ensuring in these batteries viability.

TI  - Endocrine disrupting effects, at different temperatures, on Moina micrura (Cladocera: Crustacea) induced by carbendazim, a fungicide
VL  - 668
IS  - 1
SP  - 155-170
AB  - Pesticide-induced effects in non-target organisms are a worldwide environmental problem and cladocerans have been used as test organisms to quantify the toxicity effects. However, little is known about the true risks of acceptable levels, when non-traditional end points such as sex determination, egg maturation, and teratogenesis are considered. Aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of sublethal concentrations of the fungicide carbendazim taking into account the above-mentioned endpoints and to evaluate their sensitivity to an environmental factor such as temperature, known to influence growth rates and sex determination in cladocerans. We quantified the effect on the life history variables of Moina micrura at two different temperatures using the life table demographic approach, starting with neonates. The median lethal concentration of carbendazim for M. micrura was 0.12 +/- A 0.01 mg l(-1). The impacts of carbendazim were assessed in experiments conducted at 20A degrees C (experiment 1) and 30A degrees C (experiment 3) using four sublethal concentrations of carbendazim (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) and controls. An additional experiment (experiment 2) on the next generation (F1) was conducted at 20A degrees C, using the offspring of the second clutches of M. micrura from each of the corresponding treatments of the experiment 1. The increase in temperature from 20 to 30A degrees C significantly reduced always the average lifespan and life expectancy at birth, while raised the rate of population increase, net reproductive rate, and reproductive effort, in controls but not in carbendazim treatments. Higher temperature also increased male/female ratio. The patterns of survivorship curves were weakly affected by carbendazim exposure, but increase in concentration of this fungicide reduced offspring production, reproductive rates, and the rate of population increase, more noticeable at the higher temperature. These detrimental effects were much more striking in the F1 experiment, in which females were unable to produce viable offspring in the two highest carbendazim concentrations, although survival and swimming behavior were not significantly affected. This indicates that sensitivity to the toxicant is greater during egg development and that the fungicide acts as an endocrine disruptor. The presence of carbendazim in the medium resulted in higher male production as compared with controls, indicating also its effect on egg development. We also encountered a few individuals, with abnormal sexual secondary characters (males with reduced antennule length, similar to female antennules) at the highest carbendazim concentration. The role of carbendazim on the demography of cladocerans in natural systems, subject to temperature increase, is discussed taking into account the persistence of this chemical and its elevated impact in the successive generations (through the higher sensitivity of the developing eggs to the chemical at high temperatures). Cladoceran bioassays starting with neonates, which usually utilize offspring as sublethal endpoints should include the first generation to evaluate fecundity responses.

AB  - Mahanarva finibriolata (Stal) (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) is the most important pest of sugarcane harvested without the use of fire to burn leaf trash. Its biology was studied for three generations in order to obtain basic information about its life cycle. A fertility life table was used to evaluate the quality of laboratory-reared insects. Data were obtained at a temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, RH of 70 +/- 10%, and a 14-hour photophase. The incubation period lasted 21 days with a viability of 81%; the nymph,stage had a duration of 37 days, with a 94% viability; the male and female longevities were 18 and 23 days, respectively, with a pre-oviposition period of 5 days and an oviposition period of 16 days, with a fecundity of 342 eggs, with a life-cycle (egg-adult) of 60 days. A net reproductive rate (Ro) of 131 females produced per female per generation was measured, with a finite rate of increase (lambda) of 1.085. The fertility life table proved to be adequate to be evaluate the quality of laboratory-reared M. fimbriolata populations.

TI  - Simulation accuracy enhancement with automatic parameters identification for femtosecond laser ablation
VL  - 74
SP  - 426-440
AB  - Femtosecond laser processing is a non-thermal process with less heat effect on a target material and is applied to dielectric and difficult-to-machine materials, such as titanium alloy and diamond. Femtosecond laser processing has been used for 3-dimensional shape generation in recent years, and increasing accuracy and productivity are required for such generation by femtosecond lasers. However, a 2.5-dimensional computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system, which is mainly used in femtosecond laser processing, does not satisfy the requirement for complicated 3-dimensional shape generation. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a 3-dimensional CAM system for high-precision and productive 3-dimensional processing. Furthermore, for the 3-dimensional CAM system, quantitative identification of a 3-dimensional removal shape through ablation is necessary. This study proposes the development of a simulation method to accurately predict the 3-dimensional removal shape through femtosecond laser processing, including the piecewise approximation of the ablation rate and absorptance correction. At the same time, a similar 3-dimensional shape as that found through the experimental results was obtained during the simulation by considering the mechanical errors of the laser processing machine in the simulation model. Furthermore, an on-machine measurement system was developed to efficiently identify the ablation parameters.

VL  - 6
IS  - 12
SP  - 4159-4167
AB  - Ni and Co as active metals, supported on Al2O3, ZnO and AlZnOx were tested in partial oxidation and the steam reforming processes. The effect of catalysts for syngas production by catalytic reforming of bioethanol and acetic acid for power generation of SOFC was studied. Single supported Ni or Co catalysts, showed high activity but different product distribution. The Al2O3 supported catalysts were quickly deactivated by carbon deposition because of ethylene and acetone formation over the strong acidic sites of alumina. The ZnO supported catalysts showed a remarkable higher syngas productivity compared to the Al2O3 supported samples. The catalysts supported over mixed oxide, showed higher activity in partial oxidation and the steam reforming in comparison to single oxide samples. In partial oxidation of ethanol NiAlZnOx sample was more active, however in steam reforming of acetic acid CoAlZnOx sample showed better performance. In situ XRD study of ZnO and AlZnOx supported samples showed that both series have similar phase composition, which is determined by the properties of ZnO, especially its oxygen mobility at high temperature. Alloy structure formation and the reduction of active metals under the reaction conditions provided high performance of these catalysts in partial oxidation and steam reforming with high production to syngas.

TI  - Linking reproduction and predation parameters, which determine the success of predators of Tetranychus urticae (Koch), with climatological data of different strawberry culture systems
SP  - 667-670
AB  - Strawberries are produced in Belgium with different cultivation methods (glasshouse/plastic tunnel/open field, June/ever bearing varieties, early/retarded,...). In each cultivation system different climatological conditions like temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and duration of the light period (L) occur. These climatological differences have important influences on the fitness and success of beneficial fauna which is introduced in strawberry fields to control phytophageous pests. So far, too many failures have occurred in biological or integrated pest management due to inappropriate development of the beneficial fauna followed by an insufficient control of the pest. For two beneficial species Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) that control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), predation and reproduction parameters were studied under different T-RH-L combinations. Predation success was recorded as the amount of consumed eggs. The studied reproduction parameters included fecundity, egg hatch, larval and nymphal survival, sex ratio and generation time. For each condition, an eventual preference (or the absence of a preference) for a beneficial species was determined. Moreover, 'in crop' climatological conditions were followed using 15 minute recordings of T and RH in the most important strawberry culture systems from planting till harvest.

TI  - Thermal kinetics on adsorption heat transformation based on activated biocarbon and ethanol as working pairs
VL  - 311
AB  - Cooling systems and refrigerators based on adsorption heat transformation processes (AHT) are a green alter -native to compression cooling systems. Considering the increasing demand for human comfort, there is a crucial need for next-generation energy-efficient technologies, where the modeling and understanding of all parameters is a milestone. The viability and performance of the technology rely on the selected pair adsorbent/working fluid, but further from their pure thermodynamic performance, processing, and its derivates kinetic factors are depicted high relevant. In this work, ethanol adsorption kinetics on classic commercial adsorbents (activated carbon, AC) are predicted and further determined. The adsorptive phenomenon was investigated by means of computational simulation based on implemented Linear Driving Force (LDF) and the results were compared with experimental adsorption isotherms modeled by using Dubinin-Astakhov equation. The specific cooling effect (SCE) was studied by temperature monitoring during ethanol vapor adsorption experiments in a transient regime.

TI  - Next-generation, affordable SO2 abatement for coal-fired power generation - A comparison of limestone-based wet flue gas desulphurization and Sulfacid (R) technologies for Medupi power station
VL  - 120
IS  - 10
SP  - 581-589
AB  - Synopsis Coal is used to generate more than three-quarters of South Africa's electricity, while numerous coal-fired boilers are employed for steam generation in industrial processes. However, coal-fired power generation is responsible for the release of the largest quantities of SO2 emissions to the atmosphere and leads to detrimental health and welfare effects in communities in the proximity of coal-fired plants. The classical industrial SO2 abatement solution for the coal-fired power generation industry is wet flue gas desulphurization, which uses a limestone adsorbent and produces a gypsum by-product (WFGD L/G). In South Africa, due to the poor quality of the limestone the gypsum product is unsaleable and is co-disposed with coal ash. In comparison, the Sulfacid (R) process technology converts SO2 contained in industrial flue gas into saleable sulphuric acid using a catalytic process requiring only water and air. This process does not require limestone. The scale of the latest commercial applications of the Sulfacid (R) SO2 abatement technology in the chemical, fertilizer, and copper mining industries demonstrates the potential and readiness of this technology to be employed in the coal-fired electricity and steam production sectors. This paper provides a first-order direct comparison between the techno-economic aspects of the WFGD (L/G) and Sulfacid (R) technologies using the requirements specified for the 6 x 800 MWe Eskom coal-fired Medupi power station. The results indicate that affordable flue gas desulphurization technology exists that could be adopted by the South African industry to reduce SO2 emissions to legislative limits and beyond.

TI  - In vivo molecular evolution reveals biophysical origins of organismal fitness
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SP  - 441-449
AB  - In nature, evolution occurs through the continuous adaptation of a population to its environment. At the molecular level, adaptive changes in protein sequence and expression impact organismal fitness and, consequently, dictate population dynamics. Here, we have used a "weak link" method to favor variations in one gene, allowing adaptation to thermostability to be studied in molecular detail as bacteria were grown continuously for similar to 1500 generations. Surprisingly, only six mutant alleles, representing less than 1% of the possible missense mutations, were observed, suggesting a highly constrained molecular landscape during protein evolution. The changes in organismal fitness were linked directly to incremental increases in enzyme stability and activity maxima and corresponded to the narrow temperature ranges where each mutant enjoyed success within the overall population. Thus, continuous evolution of a single gene permits a quantitative approach that extends from the phenotypes of the microbial populations to their underlying biophysical basis.

TI  - Low-Concentration Solar-Power Systems Based on Organic Rankine Cycles for Distributed-Scale Applications: Overview and Further Developments
AB  - This paper is concerned with the emergence and development of low-to-medium-grade thermal-energy-conversion systems for distributed power generation based on thermodynamic vapor-phase heat-engine cycles undergone by organic working fluids, namely organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). ORC power systems are, to some extent, a relatively established and mature technology that is well-suited to converting low/medium-grade heat (at temperatures up to similar to 300-400 degrees C) to useful work, at an output power scale from a few kilowatts to 10s of megawatts. Thermal efficiencies in excess of 25% are achievable at higher temperatures and larger scales, and efforts are currently in progress to improve the overall economic viability and thus uptake of ORC power systems, by focusing on advanced architectures, working-fluid selection, heat exchangers and expansion machines. Solar-power systems based on ORC technology have a significant potential to be used for distributed power generation, by converting thermal energy from simple and low-cost non-concentrated or low-concentration collectors to mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical energy. Current fields of use include mainly geothermal and biomass/biogas, as well as the recovery and conversion of waste heat, leading to improved energy efficiency, primary energy (i.e., fuel) use and emission minimization, yet the technology is highly transferable to solar-power generation as an affordable alternative to small-to-medium-scale photovoltaic systems. Solar-ORC systems offer naturally the advantages of providing a simultaneous thermal-energy output for hot water provision and/or space heating, and the particularly interesting possibility of relatively straightforward onsite (thermal) energy storage. Key performance characteristics are presented, and important heat transfer effects that act to limit performance are identified as noteworthy directions of future research for the further development of this technology.

TI  - Temperature-dependent energy gain of bifacial PV farms: A global perspective
VL  - 276
AB  - Bifacial solar panels are perceived to be the technology of choice for next-generation solar farms for their increased energy yield at a marginally increased cost. As the bifacial farms proliferate around the world, it is important to investigate the role of temperature-dependent energy-yield and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of bifacial solar farms relative to monofacial farms, stand-alone bifacial modules, and various competing bifacial technologies. In this work, we integrate existing irradiance and light collection models with experimentally validated physics-based temperature-dependent efficiency models to compare the energy yield and LCOE of various bifacial technologies across the world. We find that temperature-dependent efficiency changes the energy yield and LCOE by approximately - 10 to15%. Indeed, the results differ significantly depending on the location of the farm (defines the illumination and ambient temperature), the elevation of the module (increases light collection), as well as the temperature-coefficients of various bifacial technologies. The analysis presented in this paper will allow us to realistically assess location-specific relative advantage and economic viability of the next generation bifacial solar farms.

TI  - Distributed generation and water production: A study for a region in central Italy
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 218-225
AB  - This study examines the use of distributed power plants coupled to desalination systems to achieve combined production of electrical energy and of water for drinking and similar purposes in Marches, an Adriatic region in central Italy. To reduce Marches' large electricity deficit, the regional government has drawn up an environmental and energy plan promoting distributed generation through power plants built right where the electricity is consumed. At the same time, the region's abundant water resources are increasingly threatened by aquifer pollution, due particularly to fertilizers and to the phenomenon of saltwater intrusion near the coast. Distributed electrical energy generation combined with water production can help meet the goal of reducing the electrical deficit while at the same time improving ground-water quality and reducing the hydrogeological risk. The solution is also efficient, since the more the useful heat recovered by the energy system, the higher its global efficiency. Furthermore, coupling power plants to desalination units is also an excellent application of cogeneration systems, allowing useful recovery of thermal energy in the summer. The study examines different sized plants for the distributed generation of water and power in Marches, from small units to thermal desalination systems that can be coupled to existing power plants. It shows that although endowing existing large power plants with MED (multiple effect distillation) units makes it possible to meet 58% of the freshwater demand in Marches, it further increases the electricity deficit, whereas coupling small or medium-sized distributed power plants to reverse osmosis systems allows meeting 75% of the demand for freshwater and reduces the electrical energy demand by up to 50% in the more energy-intensive districts.

IS  - 1
SP  - 62-66
AB  - Despite the potential constraints imposed by cutaneous; respiration and nocturnality, some salamanders actively thermoregulate when conditions permit. We measured substrate temperature selection in two species of Desmognathus in a moist thermal gradient in the laboratory. Desmognathus monticola selected significantly higher temperatures than Desmognathus quadramaculatus. Although the substrate temperatures selected by D. quadramaculatus did not vary over time (mean +/- 1 SE = 13.6 +/- 1.1 C), D. monticola selected significantly higher temperatures at night than during the day. Mean temperatures selected by D. monticola were 14.0 +/- 1.5 C from 12001600 and 19.7 +/- 1.6 C from 2000-0000 h. This difference in temporal patterns is consistent with field behavior, because A monticola is more frequently found away from water at night than is D. quadranzaculatus.

TI  - Thermal aberration control in projection lens
VL  - 6924
AB  - In order to respond to the constant demand for more productivity in the manufacture of IC devices, higher throughput and higher resolution are fundamental requirements for each new generation of exposure tools. However, meeting both requirements lead to unwanted aberration we refer to as "thermal aberration". In our experience, the problem of the thermal aberrations does not correlated only to the duration of heavy use. It depends very strongly on both the optical settings and the mask patterns, also even on the specific interaction between the two. So, even if using the same illumination settings, there is a possibility to observe different distribution of thermal aberrations. In this paper, we define and investigate various patterns to be used as targets for thermal aberrations compensation. These patterns are identified as the "weak patterns" of the thermal aberration. We assess several cases of thermal aberrations, and show how the optimized compensation for each is determined and then applied on the actual exposure tools.

TI  - Flying too close to the Sun - The viability of perihelion-induced aqueous alteration on periodic comets
VL  - 351
AB  - Comets are typically considered to be pristine remnants of the early solar system. However, by definition they evolve significantly over their lifetimes through evaporation, sublimation, degassing and dust release. This occurs once they enter the inner solar system and are heated by the Sun. Some comets (e.g. 1P/Halley, 9P/Tempel and Hale-Bopp) as well as chondritic porous cosmic dust - released from comets - show evidence of minor aqueous alteration resulting in the formation of phyllosilicates, carbonates or other secondary phases (e.g. Cu-sulphides, amphibole and magnetite). These observations suggest that (at least some) comets experienced limited interaction with liquid water under conditions distinct from the alteration histories of hydrated chondritic asteroids (e.g. the CM and CR chondrites). This synthesis paper explores the viability of perihelion-induced heating as a mechanism for the generation of highly localised subsurface liquid water and thus mild aqueous alteration in periodic comets. We draw constraints from experimental laboratory studies, numerical modelling, spacecraft observations and microanalysis studies of cometary micrometeorites. Both temperature and pressure conditions necessary for the generation and short-term (hour-long) survival of liquid water are plausible within the immediate subsurface (<0.5 m depth) of periodic comets with small perihelia (<1.5 A.U.), low surface permeabilities and favourable rotational states (e.g. high obliquities and/or slow rotational periods). We estimate that solar radiant heating may generate liquid water and perform aqueous alteration reactions in 3-9% of periodic comets. An example of an ideal candidate is 2P/Encke which has a small perihelion (0.33 A.U.), a high obliquity and a short orbital period. This comet should therefore be considered a high priority candidate in future spectroscopic studies of comet surfaces. Small quantities of phyllosilicate generated by aqueous alteration may be important in cementing together grains in the subsurface of older dormant comets, thereby explaining observations of unexpectedly high tensile strength in some bodies. Most periodic comets which currently pass close to the Sun are dormant, having experienced surface heating, significant cometary activity and dust release in the past. These bodies may be responsible for the partially hydrated cometary micrometeorites we find at the Earth's surface and their aqueous alteration histories may have been produced by perihelion-induced subsurface heating. This is in contrast to radiogenic and impact heating that operated during the early solar system on asteroids. This study has implications for the alteration history of the active asteroid Phaethon, the target of JAXA's DESTINY+ mission.

TI  - Genetic constraints for thermal coadaptation in Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Behaviour has been traditionally viewed as a driver of subsequent evolution because behavioural adjustments expose organisms to novel environments, which may result in a correlated evolution on other traits. In Drosophila subobscura, thermal preference and heat tolerance are linked to chromosomal inversion polymorphisms that show parallel latitudinal clines worldwide, such that "cold-climate" ("warm-climate") chromosome arrangements collectively favour a coherent response to colder (warmer) settings as flies carrying them prefer colder (warmer) conditions and have lower (higher) knock out temperatures. Yet, it is not clear whether a genetic correlation between thermal preference and heat tolerance can partially underlie such response. Results: We have analyzed the genetic basis of thermal preference and heat tolerance using isochromosomal lines in D. subobscura. Chromosome arrangements on the O chromosome were known to have a biometrical effect on thermal preference in a laboratory temperature gradient, and also harbour several genes involved in the heat shock response; in particular, the genes Hsp68 and Hsp70. Our results corroborate that arrangements on chromosome O affect adult thermal preference in a laboratory temperature gradient, with cold-climate O-st carriers displaying a lower thermal preference than their warm-climate O3+4 and O3+4+8 counterparts. However, these chromosome arrangements did not have any effect on adult heat tolerance and, hence, we putatively discard a genetic covariance between both traits arising from linkage disequilibrium between genes affecting thermal preference and candidate genes for heat shock resistance. Nonetheless, a possible association of juvenile thermal preference and heat resistance warrants further analysis. Conclusions: Thermal preference and heat tolerance in the isochromosomal lines of D. subobscura appear to be genetically independent, which might potentially prevent a coherent response of behaviour and physiology (i.e., coadaptation) to thermal selection. If this pattern is general to all chromosomes, then any correlation between thermal preference and heat resistance across latitudinal gradients would likely reflect a pattern of correlated selection rather than genetic correlation.

TI  - VIABILITY OF CERAMIC HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT EXCHANGERS FOR NGNP APPLICATIONS
SP  - 435-443
AB  - The recent developments in the energy industry have kindled renewed interest in producing energy more efficiently. This has motivated the development of higher temperature cycles and their associated equipment. In this paper we will discuss several design configurations coupled with the inherent properties of preferred ceramic materials to assess the viability and design reliability of ceramic heat exchangers for next generation high temperature heat exchangers. These analyses have been extended to conceptually compare the traditional shell and tube heat exchanger with shell and plate heat exchangers. These analyses include hydrodynamic, heat transfer, mechanical stress and reliability models applicable to an Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) and Process Coupling Heat Exchangers. It was found that ceramic micro-channel heat exchanger designs proved to have the greatest reliability due to their inherent mechanical properties, minimal thermo-mechanical stresses while improving the performance efficiency in a compact footprint.

TI  - Thermal stabilization of digesters of biogas plants by means of optimization of the surface radiative properties of the gasometer domes
VL  - 45
SP  - 1344-1353
AB  - A new incentive scheme for power generation from biogas is favoring in Italy the construction of small plants. These ones, however, have poorer financial viability and biological stability than larger plants. In order to ensure adequate performance and a reasonable payback period it is therefore essential that every aspect of their operations is carefully designed. In this respect, summer overheating of anaerobic digesters due to solar gains must be prevented. A solution relies upon the implementation of a 'cool' gasometer dome with properly chosen solar reflectance, whose effectiveness was assessed through the use of a calculation code specifically built and validated by comparison with experimental data.

TI  - Adaptive maternal and paternal effects: gamete plasticity in response to parental stress
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 724-733
AB  - Transgenerational phenotypic plasticity is increasingly recognized as an important buffer of environmental change - many studies show that mothers alter the phenotype of their offspring so as to maximize their performance in their local environment. Fewer studies have examined the capacity of parents to alter the phenotype of their gametes to cope with environmental change. In organisms that shed their gametes externally, gametes are extremely vulnerable to local stresses and transgenerational plasticity in the phenotypes of gametes seems likely in this group. In a marine tubeworm, Hydroides diramphus, we manipulated the salinity environment that mothers and fathers experienced before reproduction and then examined the phenotype of their gametes, as well as the performance of those gametes and the resultant larvae in different salinities. We found strong evidence for gamete plasticity - both mothers and fathers adaptively adjust the phenotype of their gametes to maximize the performance of those gametes in the salinity regime experienced by their parents. Parents were quite flexible in the phenotype of gametes that they produced: they could switch the salinity tolerance of their gametes back and forth depending on their most recent experience. Gamete plasticity was not without risks, however. We observed strong trade-offs in performance when gametes experienced an environment that did not match that of their parents. These effects of the parental environment persist for the duration of the larval phase such that larvae may not be able to disperse to environments that do not match their parents. Gamete plasticity may therefore represent an important source of phenotype-environment mismatches. Gamete plasticity may represent an important mechanism for coping with environmental change and an important source of maternal and paternal effects in species with external fertilization. Studies that seek to predict the impacts of stresses that persist across generations (e.g. ocean acidification) should include parental exposures to the stress of interest.

TI  - Amphibian population declines: Evolutionary considerations
VL  - 57

SP  - 437-444
AB  - Numerous factors, such as global environmental changes, habitat destruction, introduced species, diseases, and chemical pollution, appear to be contributing to amphibian population declines. Moreover, the life history characteristics and behavior of many amphibian species appear to be placing them in jeopardy. Such behaviors and ecological attributes were molded over evolutionary time under selection pressures that acted on amphibians in a variety of ways. Many biologists who study amphibian population declines, however, have failed to consider some of these evolutionary aspects. Better understanding of amphibian population declines requires that scientists and policy makers consider the ecological processes associated with the declines in light of evolutionary principles such as these: Evolution is limited by historical constraints; not all evolution is adaptive; adaptations are often compromises; evolution can only alter existing variations; and evolution takes time.

TI  - Semi-Interpenetrating Polymer Network Biomimetic Structure Enables Superelastic and Thermostable Nanofibrous Aerogels for Cascade Filtration of PM2.5
VL  - 30
IS  - 14
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) has taken heavy tolls on the global economy and public health, calling for air filters that can remove PM from high-temperature emission sources. However, creating desirable filter media capable of capturing polydisperse fine particles (PFPs) effectively and enduringly, while also withstanding high speed airstream, is extremely challenging. Here, a biomimetic and bottom-up strategy to prepare superelastic, strong, and thermostable nanofibrous aerogels (NFAs) as cascade filters by assembling semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN)-based nanofibers into a gradient architecture is reported. Inspired by the robust loofah sponges originating from stiff cellulose networks, the mechanical property of NFAs is enhanced via tailoring the chain flexibility of heat-resistant semi-IPNs. Further constructing a gradient cellular architecture endows NFAs with a versatile cascade filtration behavior for capturing polydisperse fine particles. The resultant semi-IPN-based gradient NFAs exhibit temperature-invariant superelasticity, a high compressive stress (7.9 kPa) and modulus (12 kPa), high filtration efficiency (>99.97%, PM0.3), low pressure drop (approximate to 50% that of membranes), and ultrahigh dust-holding capacity (114 g m(-2)). The fabrication of this attractive material paves the way for designing next-generation air filters for industrial dust removal.

TI  - Local adaptation of stress related traits in Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila simulans in spite of high gene flow
VL  - 22
IS  - 5
SP  - 1111-1122
AB  - We addressed the question if local adaptation to a thermal gradient is possible in spite of a high gene flow among closely spaced populations of two species of Drosophila from the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands). Variation in multiple traits related to stress resistance in different life stages was measured in both species in flies collected from five localities at different altitudes and thereby with different climatic conditions. Based on microsatellite loci, the populations were not genetically differentiated. However, 18 of the 24 independent traits measured showed significant differentiation among populations of Drosophila buzzatii, but only nine of 25 for Drosophila simulans. This difference in the number of traits might reflect higher habitat specificity and thus higher potential for local adaptation of D. buzzatii than D. simulans. We found clinal variation, as some traits showed significant linear regressions on altitude, but more on altitude cubed.

TI  - Temperature responses in a subarctic springtail from two geothermally warmed habitats
VL  - 78
AB  - Common-garden experiments with populations sampled along natural thermal gradients help to reveal local adaptation, disentangle environmental and genetic effects, and ultimately predict, by analogy, future biotic responses to climate change. In this regard, geothermal habitats are useful model systems as they exhibit dramatic changes in soil temperature. The springtail Protaphorura pseudovanderdrifti has apparently coped with such local geothermal warming in Iceland, as this species occurs along a more than half-century-old geothermal gradient in a grassland and persists along a newly emerged temperature gradient in a previously non-geothermal planted spruce forest. We measured thermal reaction norms for development and walking speed and acute cold shock tolerance of P. pseudovanderdrifti originating from the grassland and forest geothermal gradients. Temperature-dependent juvenile development showed little variation among subpopulations from the recently warmed forest, probably due to insufficient evolutionary time, but springtails from the warmed grassland plots had significantly steeper reaction norms than their counterparts from the corresponding unwarmed plot. In contrast, cold tolerance and locomotory activity showed no conclusive clinal pattern despite significant within-habitat variation. There appeared to be significant differences between habitats, as springtails from the forest had more temperature-sensitive developmental rate and locomotory activity, walked faster, and exhibited more variable cold tolerance than grassland springtails did. The planting of a forest, therefore, seems to have exerted a stronger effect on the thermal phenotype of P. pseudovanderdrifti than the emergence of a geothermal gradient. Thus, habitat properties may be no less important in shaping thermal reaction norms than the mean temperature. These local-scale findings suggest that, in addition to warming per se, global transformation of communities may drive the evolution of thermal phenotypes to an extent comparable with the effect of rising environmental temperature.

TI  - A continuous compact model for cascaded hydro-power generation and preventive maintenance scheduling
VL  - 73
SP  - 702-710
AB  - This paper proposes a new nonlinear model for cascaded hydro-power generation and preventive maintenance scheduling. The reservoir level and the maintenance scheduling are optimized, simultaneously, to minimize the thermal generation complement and to maximize the future water value. To achieve better accuracy, the productivity was modeled considering the head effect. Since the model considers individualized plants, the water flow balance must be taken into account. By means of a transformation, this constraint can be modeled only with the reservoir volume. Also, by means of a simple nonlinear transformation, the maintenance scheduling was modeled as continuous variable, instead of the usual binary models. The maintenance start date is a continuous variable, so, it allows the maintenance to begin within the time period. These simplifications altogether define a compact continuous nonconvex problem. The proposed model was successfully solved by a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm in Brazilian cascades. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 24

SP  - 995-1003
AB  - Niger (Guizotia abyssinica) is an economically important edible oilseed crop with a wide variation in seed oil content and fatty acid composition between populations. This study sought to determine the extent of this variation among the Ethiopian niger populations and to analyze the inheritance of high oil and oleic acid (C18:1) contents. The analysis of 153 niger populations revealed a twofold variation in seed oil content (27-56%) with 7% of the populations having more than 50% oil. These high oil content populations came from different regions and a wide altitudinal range (1400-2590 m asl). There was also a high variation in oleic acid content between populations (3.3-31.1%). Interestingly, the populations with more than 13% oleic acid were entirely collected from elevations of less than 2000 m asl. Breeding of selected genotypes for two generations revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the parents and their progenies both in oil and oleic acid contents. The study also suggests a significant contribution of environmental factors to the variation in both traits suggesting a moderate heritability. We conclude that there is a highly significant variation both in oil content and fatty acid composition in the niger populations that can be used for its improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As part of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Power Electronics and Electric Machines program area, the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently leading a national effort to develop next-generation cooling technologies for hybrid vehicle electronics. Spray cooling has been identified as a potential solution that can dissipate 150-200 W/cm(2) while maintaining the chip temperature below 125 degrees C. This paper explores the viability and implementation of this cooling scheme. First, commercial coolants are assessed for their suitability to this application in terms of thermal, environmental, and safety concerns and material compatibility. In this assessment, HFE-7100 is identified as the optimum coolant in all performance categories. Next, spray models are used to determine the HFE-7100 spray conditions that meet such stringent heat dissipation requirements. These findings are verified experimentally, demonstrating that spray cooling is a viable thermal management solution for hybrid vehicle electronics.

TI  - Mediterranean and Northern Iberian gene pools of wild Castanea sativa Mill. are two differentiated ecotypes originated under natural divergent selection
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
AB  - Nine wild Iberian provenances of Castanea sativa Mill. grouped in two gene pools, North Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean, were evaluated for several adaptive traits in two provenance-progeny trials with the aim of evaluating the role of natural selection in shaping adaptive variation and increasing our understanding of the genetic structure of this species, as well as reporting complete information on the genetic variation among and within the studied populations. An annual growth rhythm experiment was evaluated during the first 3 years after establishment for phenology, growth, stem form and survival, and a periodic drought-stress experiment was evaluated for dry weight, growth, survival and other related drought traits in both well-watered and drought-stress treatments. The high genetic variability reported in both trials is largely due to the genetic variation among populations. The significant differences reported between quantitative genetic and neutral marker differentiation indicated the local adaptation of these populations through directional selection, mainly for phenology, growth and biomass allocation. A clinal variation among populations was determined through correlations of phenology with latitude and xerothermic index of the provenances, showing that central and southern Mediterranean populations had earlier phenology than northern populations and that drought played a relevant role in this differentiation. The significant correlation between phenological traits and the ancestry values in the Mediterranean gene pool supported the different pattern of behavior between both gene pools and also indicated the existence of two ecotypes: xeric and mesophytic ecotypes, corresponding to Mediterranean and North Iberian gene pools, respectively. The results obtained in the drought-stress experiment confirmed that, in general terms, xeric populations showed a greater adaptability to drought, with more developed root systems and higher survival than northern populations. Moreover, the genetic variability observed within populations indicated the potential response capacity of Iberian C. sativa populations to undergo fast adaptive evolution.

TI  - Cytochrome P450 metabolic resistance (CYP6P9a) to pyrethroids imposes a fitness cost in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus
VL  - 124
IS  - 5
SP  - 621-632
AB  - Metabolic resistance threatens the sustainability of pyrethroid-based malaria control interventions. Elucidating the fitness cost and potential reversal of metabolic resistance is crucial to design suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we deciphered the fitness cost associated with the CYP6P9a (P450-mediated metabolic resistance) in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus. Reciprocal crosses were performed between a pyrethroid susceptible (FANG) and resistant (FUMOZ-R) laboratory strains and the hybrid strains showed intermediate resistance. Genotyping the CYP6P9a-R resistance allele in oviposited females revealed that CYP6P9a negatively impacts the fecundity as homozygote susceptible mosquitoes (CYP6P9a-SS) lay more eggs than heterozygote (OR = 2.04: P = 0.01) and homozygote resistant mosquitoes. CYP6P9a also imposes a significant fitness cost on the larval development as homozygote resistant larvae (CYP6P9a-RR) developed significantly slower than heterozygote and homozygote susceptible mosquitoes (chi(2) = 11.2; P = 0.0008). This fitness cost was further supported by the late pupation of homozygote resistant than susceptible mosquitoes (OR = 2.50; P < 0.01). However, CYP6P9a does not impact the longevity as no difference was observed in the life span of mosquitoes with different genotypes (chi(2) = 1.6; P = 0.9). In this hybrid strain, a significant decrease of the resistant CYP6P9a-RR genotype was observed after ten generations (chi(2) = 6.6; P = 0.01) suggesting a reversal of P450-based resistance in the absence of selection. This study shows that the P450-mediated metabolic resistance imposes a high fitness cost in malaria vectors supporting that a resistance management strategy based on rotation could help mitigate the impact of such resistance.

TI  - Designing a bioinspired synthetic tree by unidirectional freezing for simultaneous solar steam generation and salt collection
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Solar steam generation with thermal localization was recently proposed for highly efficient solar-thermal desalination. However, to achieve high steam productivity with long term stability remains a critical challenge due to salt accumulation at the evaporation surface. Here, we designed a T-shaped synthetic tree that could simultaneously achieve high steam productivity and salt collection with the structure characteristics of interfacial thermal evaporation, ambient energy harvesting and edge-preferential crystallizing. Under 1sun, the synthetic tree exhibited a steady water evaporation rate of 2.03kgm(-2) hours(-1) over 60hours, achieving solar thermal efficiency of 75%. Salt was continuously rejected at the edge of the evaporator with a steady collection rate of 59.879gm(-2) hours(-1), which did not affect water evaporation. This new design principle to simultaneously harvest water and salt provides a new avenue for solar energy utilization.

TI  - Contemporary climate change and terrestrial invertebrates: evolutionary versus plastic changes
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SP  - 56-67
AB  - To forecast the responses of species to future climate change, an understanding of the ability of species to adapt to long-term shifts in temperature is crucial. We present a review on evolutionary adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of temperature-related traits in terrestrial invertebrates. The evidence for adaptive evolution in melanization is good, but we caution that genetic determination needs to be tested in each individual species, and complex genetic correlations may exist. For phenological traits allochronic data sets provide powerful means to track climate-induced changes; however, rarely are responses deconstructed into evolutionary and plastic responses. Laboratory studies suggest climate change responses in these traits will be driven by both. For stress resistance, the evidence for shifts in traits is poor. Studies leaning heavily on Drosophila have demonstrated potential limits to evolutionary responses in desiccation and heat resistance. Quantifying the capacity for these species to respond plastically and extending this work to other taxa will be an important next step. We also note that, although not strictly speaking a species trait, the response of endosymbionts to heat stress requires further study. Finally, while clearly genetic, and possibly adaptive, the anonymous nature of latitudinal shifts in clines of genetic markers in Drosophila prevents further interpretation.

TI  - MODEL-BASED OPTIMIZATION OF THE OPERATION OF THE COKE CALCINING KILN
VL  - 31

SP  - 1139-1147
AB  - A mathematical model was recently developed to simulate the calcination process of regular petroleum coke suitable for aluminum industry applications. The model is made of 14 ordinary differential equations describing energy and mass conservation in the gas and in the coke bed, and complemented by correlations and algebraic equations. It calculates temperature and concentration profiles in the kiln, and also yields other information important to kiln operation, such as calcined coke recovery factor and coke loss through the generation of dust. In this paper it is demonstrated that the model is an efficient tool for the optimization of kiln operation. The model is used to study the effect of key control variables upon kiln operation and productivity. Further, it is shown that higher kiln productivity may be obtained with optimized kiln control and without loss of satisfactory kiln operating condition.

AB  - Five Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains and one nonpathogenic E. coli strain were used. All strains were cultured in brain heart infusion broth and were inoculated in 16-well disposable module cassettes of a Bactometer impedance system. Two initial concentrations were obtained in the wells: 1.37 x 10(3) and 1.36 x 10(5) CFU/ml. The impedance measurements were monitored for 72 h at 5, 10, or 15 degrees C, 48 h at 20 degrees C, and 24 h at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or 55 degrees C. The lag time and the generation time of each culture were calculated from the detection time data. The coefficients of variation between the strains' growth parameters were low (0.009 to 0.105 for generation time and 0.074 to 0.475 for lag time). An F test showed no significant differences between strains at 5 or 1% confidence levels.

SP  - 662-665
AB  - The target of our study is the Monarch Butterfly, which is known for its multi-generational migration behavior: it migrates between southern Canada and Mexico over the course of one year within three to four generations. We approach this subject by using an evolutionary simulation that is an ecosystem consisting of artificial agents and five areas. We focus on the metamorphosis and the reproductive diapause, which are the ecological characteristics of the Monarch, and we design a model of agent which has the state as its inner parameter. We simulate under the environmental condition that the average annual temperature rises every year, which is modeled on the current global temperature rise. Our agents emerge the migration behavior similar to the multi-generational migration behavior of the actual Monarch. The migration process of the agents and their genetic factors are discussed, and our proposed model and the previous model are compared.

TI  - Entropy generation theory for characterizing the freezing and thawing injury of biological materials
VL  - 71
IS  - 3
SP  - 125-134
AB  - As an important approach for long-term preservation of biological material, cryopreservation has been widely studied and applied in clinics. However, one of the most critical issues involved-the injury of biology material induced during freezing and thawing process still remains to be incompletely answered due to complexity of the problem itself. In this paper, we proposed for the first time to interpret the freezing or thermal injury by using the irreversible thermodynamics theory which is generalized in concept and has wide applicability. Comprehensive entropy generation analysis was performed on several typical freezing/thawing processes of biological tissues subject to cryopreservation. Particularly, variation of entropy generation rate due to injury induced change of thermal properties of the biological materials was investigated. Several useful indexes were suggested to quantify the freezing injury or viability of the biological material, through a combination with certain specific measurements. This study may possibly open a new theoretical strategy for evaluating the final output of either cryobiology or hyperthermia practices.

TI  - Dynamics of Cadmium Acclimation in Daphnia pulex: Linking Fitness Costs, Cross-Tolerance, and Hyper-Induction of Metallothionein
VL  - 53
IS  - 24
SP  - 14670-14678
AB  - Acclimation increases tolerance to stress in individuals but is assumed to contribute fitness costs when the stressor is absent, though data supporting this widely held claim are sparse. Therefore, using clonal (i.e., genetically identical) cultures of Daphnia pulex, we isolated the contributions of acclimation to the regulation of the metal response gene, metallothionein 1 (MT1), and defined the reproductive benefits and costs of cadmium (Cd)-acclimation. Daphnia pulex were exposed for 50 parthenogenetic generations to environmentally realistic levels (1 mu g Cd/L), and tolerance to Cd and other metals assessed during this period via standard toxicity tests. These tests revealed (1) increased tolerance to Cd compared to genetically identical nonacclimated cultures, (2) fitness costs in Cd-acclimated Daphnia when Cd was removed, and (3) cross-tolerance of Cd-acclimated Daphnia to zinc and silver, but not arsenic, thereby defining a functional role for metallothionein. Indeed, Cd-acclimated clones had significantly higher expression of MT1 mRNA than nonacclimated clones, when Cd exposed. Both the enhanced induction of MT1 and tolerant phenotype were rapidly lost when Cd was removed (1-2 generations), which is further evidence of acclimation costs. These findings provide evidence for the widely held view that acclimation is costly and are important for investigating evolutionary principles of genetic assimilation and the survival mechanisms of natural populations that face changing environments.

TI  - Intraspecific geographic variation in thermal limits and acclimatory capacity in a wide distributed endemic frog
VL  - 69
SP  - 254-260
AB  - Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (T-pref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and T-pret, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3% for CTmin) 10% for CTmax and T-pref and 1% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions.

VL  - 31
IS  - 2
SP  - 299-305
AB  - We found that variation in temperature and humidity significantly affected mortality rates and population dynamics of the spittlebug Deois flavopicta Stal by monitoring cohorts of diapausing eggs and nymphs for three generations. Cohorts of quiescent eggs, when exposed to increasing periods of high moisture (free water), produced higher proportions of eggs resuming embryonic development in laboratory experiments. The accumulated number of eggs resuming development as a function of (lays of exposure to moist conditions was modeled using a 0 distribution. Periods of drought and high temperatures after the beginning of postdiapause development increased embryonic and nymphal mortality. Mortality was modeled with a linear function, and in combination with the development model allowed the simulation of varying mortality rates in the newly emerged nymphal population. Comparisons with field data demonstrated a close fit to the observed and expected proportion of nymphs hatching daily. By accurately simulating natural mortality, hatching distribution and population dynamics, the model promises to be useful for managing the spittlebug in the field.

TI  - Multigenerational and transgenerational side-effects of an insecticide on eggs of Folsomia candida (Collembola)
VL  - 65
IS  - 1
SP  - 110-121
AB  - Environmental toxicants such as insecticides are able to provoke epigenetic alterations which can be inherited to future generations. The aim of the current study was to assess whether the insecticide Trebon lop (containing the active ingredient etofenprox) causes multigenerational and/or transgenerational effects on the egg traits of the collembolan Folsomia candida. The parent generation was kept in soil treated with three concentrations of the insecticide. The hatched offspring from each treatment were divided into two groups and were treated in the same manner as their parents (multigenerational effect), or remained untreated (transgenerational effect). The parents reacted with smaller eggs to the insecticide in a concentration dependent manner. Both multigenerational and transgenerational effects were detected in the offspring generations. While neither the number of eggs nor the ratios of the egg diameters (shortest/longest diameter) changed, the egg size increased as the Trebon lop concentration increased. This is an indication that parents living under insecticide stress transmit this information to their offspring, who react with higher quality egg production. Such alterations in egg traits may have important consequences on the F. candida population dynamic.

TI  - Movement Dynamics and Survival of Stocked Colorado River Cutthroat Trout
VL  - 150
IS  - 6
SP  - 679-693
AB  - The ability of native fish to establish self-sustaining populations when reintroduced to vacant habitats is variable. We evaluated factors that potentially affect the reintroduction success of juvenile Colorado River Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus that were reintroduced to an isolated watershed and were experiencing suboptimal survival and recruitment. We conducted a 3-year mark-recapture study to model annual apparent survival probability as it related to (1) different ex situ rearing strategies and (2) initial release among different habitat types. The use of PIT tags also enabled the quantification of loss via emigration. Apparent survival was highest for small fish that were minimally exposed to ex situ rearing conditions, stocked in small, headwater stream reaches. However, maximum estimates of apparent survival remained low (<= 0.38 +/- 0.05 [estimate +/- SE]) regardless of rearing treatment, stocking location, or interactive effects between covariates. Emigration of stocked fish (<1%) from the study area did not appear to limit their establishment. Our results suggest that variation in stocking and rearing strategy may have some effect on translocation success and the interaction between rearing and stocking strategy highlights the importance of considering the life history stage of stocked individuals when identifying stocking sites. Consistently low annual survival values may be indicative of a larger issue, requiring in-depth evaluation of adaptive potential within our brood source and other factors that potentially limit population persistence.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-69
AB  - Age is known to have a large effect upon fertility and survival. Here we study the impact of maternal and grandmaternal age on wing size and developmental instability (DI) in offspring using a parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum. This enabled us to cancel out any genetic variance between individuals. The mean centroid size of the wings was estimated in offspring from four maternal/grandmaternal age groups. Further, DI was calculated by measuring phenotypic variability and correcting this index for the bias produced by the environmental variability. The offspring developed from eggs laid by mothers belonging to four different age groups with young (Y) or old (O) mothers and grandmothers. The age groups are: YY, YO, OY and OO, with the first letter referring to the age of the grandmother and the second letter to the age of the mother. We consider flies between three to six days of age as young and flies between 15 and 18 days of age as old. We found that environmental variability was present in this study and therefore the correction for its bias on phenotypic variability was shown to be necessary for a correct interpretation of the results. DI displayed, for most of the traits investigated, a significantly higher level in the OY and OO age groups, as compared to the YY and YO age groups. The mean centroid size of the wings were in almost all cases significantly different among the age groups with the highest mean value in the OY group for all traits. This investigation shows that offspring are affected by maternal age and that this effect can be transmitted maternally across more than one generation.

TI  - Case Study of a Californian Brewery to Potentially Use Concentrating Solar Power for Renewable Heat Generation
SP  - 560-571
AB  - A case study for a proposed concentrating solar power (CSP) integration into an existing Californian brewery is highlighted. Using the System Advisor Model (SAM), the modelled annual thermal yield from the 1 MWth solar field (SF) was approximately 2,636 MWh(th). The economics considered the viability of the project where different variables such as the installed SF cost were changed to determine the effect on the Net Present Value (NPV) and payback period. With a 15-year project life, changing the tax rate from 35% to 21% (which occurred in 2018), flips the Base Case from economically viable with an NPV > 0 (i.e. +$9k), to economically unattractive, i.e. with an NPV = -$7k. For the Base Case, without the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), and with a Federal tax rate of 21%, the project's NPV reached $0 (i.e., the project becomes viable), when the installed SF cost reached $146/m(2). The biggest influences on project viability measured by NPV were the project life, Federal tax rate, and the SF cost. For viability, solar industrial process heat (SIPH) projects, need SF costs of $150 to $200/m(2) in California.

VL  - 2

SP  - 1122-1131
AB  - Natural gas has become the largest fuel source for electricity generation in the United States and accounts for a third of energy production and consumption. However, the environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the supply chain and over the boom-and-bust cycle have not been comprehensively characterized. To provide insight for long-term decision-making for energy transitions, we estimate the cumulative effects of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016 on air quality, climate change and employment. We find that air quality effects (1,200 to 4,600 deaths; US$23 billion +99%/-164%) and employment effects (469,000 job-years +/- 30%; US$21 billion +/- 30%) follow the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts (US$12 billion to 94 billion) persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. Employment effects concentrate in rural areas where production occurs. However, almost half of cumulative premature mortality due to air pollution is downwind of these areas, occurring in urban regions of the northeast. The cumulative effects of methane and carbon dioxide emissions on global mean temperature over a 30-yr time horizon are nearly equivalent but over the long term, the cumulative climate impact is largely due to carbon dioxide. We estimate that a tax on production of US$2 per thousand cubic feet (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain.

VL  - 61

SP  - 1725-1734
AB  - This study uses the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental system to examine evolutionary responses of bacteria to an environmental acidic-alkaline range between pH 5.3 and 7.8 (15-5000 nM [H+]). Our goal was both to test general hypotheses about adaptation to abiotic variables and to provide insights into how coliform organisms might respond to changing conditions inside and outside of hosts. Six replicate lines of E. coli evolved for 2000 generations at one of four different constant pH conditions: pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, or 7.8. Direct adaptation to the evolutionary environment, as well as correlated changes in other environments, was measured as a change in fitness relative to the ancestor in direct competition experiments. The pH 5.3 group had the highest fitness gains, with a highly significant increase of 20%. The pH 7.8 group had far less significant gains and much higher variance among its lines. Analysis of individual lines within these two groups revealed complex patterns of adaptation: all of the pH 5.3 lines exhibited trade-offs (reduced fitness in another environment), but only 33% of the pH 7.8 lines showed such trade-offs and one of the pH 7.8 lines demonstrated exaptation by improving fitness in the pH 5.3 environment. Although there was also prevalent exaptation in other groups to the acidic environment, there were no such cases of exaptation to alkalinity. Comparison across the entire experimental pH range revealed that the most acidic lines, the pH 5.3 group, were all specialists, in contrast to the pH 6.3 lines, which were almost all generalists. That is, although none of the pH 5.3 lines showed any correlated fitness gains, all of the pH 6.3 lines did.

TI  - Changes in Functional and Numerical Responses of the Parasitoid Wasp Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) Over 45 Generations of Rearing on Ephestia kuehniella
VL  - 115
IS  - 4
SP  - 326-335
AB  - We assessed the functional and numerical responses of Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko under long-term rearing (45 generations, G5-G45) on eggs of a common factitious host, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Under such long-term mass rearing, the function response of this parasitoid shifted from Type III (from G5 to G20) to Type II (from G25 to G45). The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) (33.62 hosts/day) and the shortest handling time (0.7138 +/- 0.0272 h) were recorded in G5. Also, G45 had the lowest attack rate (21.67 hosts/day) and longest handling time (1.1076 +/- 0.0689 h). The handling time increased gradually over the generations (P- reg <0.01, R-2 = 0.903). The number of eggs laid by the parasitoid increased significantly with increased host density, but reached a plateau at very high densities. While no significant differences in daily parasitism were observed over 45 generations at densities of 2, 4, 8, and 16 available host eggs per wasp, there were significant differences in parasitism at host densities of 32, 64, and 128 eggs per wasp. T. brassicae females were more active and foraged more frequently in earlier generations (G5 to G20), which allowed wasps to parasitize more E. kuehniella eggs compared to later generations. Also, continuous mass rearing of T. brassicae negatively affected foraging behavior and the quality of wasps after G20. However, rejuvenation of the colony by adding field-collected parasitoids or rearing wasps on more suitable factitious hosts is strongly recommended to lower the negative effects of long-term mass rearing on quality of this parasitoid.

The geothermal reservoir contains a two-phase zone between the cap rock and hot water zone. The target for production was designated in the deep zone, in the high temperature southern area. The production and reinjection areas have been separated to recover thermal energy efficiently during the recycling of reinjection fluid; the wells have been spaced as far apart as possible to reduce well interference. To improve productivity and injectivity, cold-water well stimulation was applied, and this experiment reduced the number of wells required for 50 MWe power generation. (C) 2000 CNR.

VL  - 102
IS  - 1
SP  - 43-48
AB  - Oligonychus litchii Lo and Ho (Arachnida: Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the primary pests in the litchi orchard and causes serious damage. We studied the effects of temperature on development and reproduction of O. litchii and constructed experimental population life tables at 5 constant temperatures (20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 degrees C) under laboratory conditions. The results showed that development, reproduction, and life table parameters of O. litchii were significantly affected by different temperatures. The egg stage had the longest period of development, and survival or development time decreased significantly with rising constant temperatures. Duration of the larva, protonymph, and deutonymph stages, and total generation time, tended to decline as the temperature increased, but development time at 26, 29, and 32 degrees C did not differ significantly. The longest generation time (egg to death of the adult) was 34.3 d at 20 degrees C, followed by 21.9 d at 23 degrees C, and it was shortest at 32 degrees C (10.7 d). There is a positive linear correlation between the temperature (T) and developmental rate (V). The developmental threshold temperature and effective accumulated temperatures for the entire generation were 13.4 degrees C and 172.41 degree-d, respectively. The highest number of eggs laid per female was 77.2 eggs at 26 degrees C, while the lowest was 30.0 eggs at 20 degrees C. The maximum population growth rate (r(m)) values increased from 20 degrees C (0.04) to 29 degrees C (0.17), then decreased at 32 degrees C (0.12). The finite rates of increase (lambda) were over 1.00 at all 5 constant temperatures. Temperature had a great effect on the development and reproduction of O. litchi, and the optimal temperature for the mite is around 26 degrees C.

VL  - 39

SP  - 1652-1658
AB  - The influence of generation (under field conditions) and photoperiod (under laboratory conditions) on Lobesia botrana larvae development was studied. Some larvae were collected during three annual generations in two grape-growing areas of northeastern Italy, and others were individually reared in the laboratory from egg to pupa on an artificial diet under two different photoperiod conditions (respectively, daylight 16 h/d [long day {LD}] and 14 h/d [short day {SD}]). The mandible lengths of collected larvae were measured and the data analyzed morphometrically to determine the number of larval instars. In the laboratory study, the number of larval moultings, the mandible length of each instar, the development time from hatching larva to pupa, and the pupal weight were considered. The measurement of mandible lengths of larvae collected in the field indicated the existence of five larval instars in all three annual generations, but the size of the two oldest larval instars was significantly higher for third-generation larvae than for the previous generations. Under laboratory conditions, the larvae usually exhibited five instars, but the mandible lengths of larvae and the pupa size were greater for individuals reared under SD. These also took a greater number of days to develop from hatching larvae to pupae. Because a larger size of the final larval instar occurs in individuals that produce diapausing pupae under SD in both the laboratory and the field, a positive association between larval size and the probability of surviving the winter can be inferred.

TI  - Experimental tests of genetic divergence of farmed from wild Atlantic salmon due to domestication
VL  - 54
IS  - 6
SP  - 1051-1063
AB  - The genetic response of Atlantic salmon to culture is important in predicting the success of these fish in nature and their impacts on wild populations through competition and interbreeding. We compared a seventh-generation strain of farmed Atlantic salmon from Sunndalsora, Norway, with its principal founder population from the wild, the River Namsen. The fish were reared from eggs in a common environment and assessed for the extent of genetic divergence in several fitness-related traits. Morphology had diverged, as farmed juveniles showed more robust bodies and smaller rayed fins than the wild juveniles. Ecologically important aspects of behaviour also differed. Farmed juveniles were more aggressive in a tank environment typical of culture facilities, while wild juveniles dominated in a stream-like environment. Farmed juveniles were also more risk-prone, reappearing from cover sooner after a simulated predator attack. It was not surprising that growth performance was higher in farmed than wild juveniles, as the former had been subjected to intentional selection for this trait. Correlated responses to this selection may also explain the higher rate of smelting and lower rate of male parr maturity in the farmed than the wild salmon. Competition with wild juveniles, however, negatively affected the growth of the farmed juveniles, particularly under semi-natural conditions. Our results indicate that fanning of Atlantic salmon generates rapid genetic change, as a result of both intentional and unintentional selection in culture, that alters important fitness-related traits.

VL  - 22

SP  - 481-492
AB  - Power generation processes are major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have been linked to the global warming phenomenon, and by relying on solar photovoltaics (PV) for power generation, GHG emissions can be minimized. However, current and future power supply scenarios in Nigeria are heavily dependent on natural-gas-fired plants. Whereas the solar energy resource available in Nigeria is adequate for PV power generation, concurrent evaluations of its technoeconomic feasibility and GHG mitigation effectiveness are lacking. In this study, 100-MW solar PV stations were proposed for 25 locations in Nigeria and analyzed for profitability and GHG mitigation effectiveness. Using the RETScreen software, energy and cost models were developed for each location, and GHG emissions the base (gas-fired plants) and proposed cases (solar PV plants) were analyzed. The systems proposed for high-latitude locations were found to be more profitable than those for low-latitude locations. Of the 25 locations, the proposed 100-MW PV plant in Gusau (lat. 11.88 degrees N, lon. 6.65 degrees) had the highest annual energy production of 167,307 MWh of electricity, a cumulative cash flow (CCF) of US$795.3 million, an energy production cost of US$66.74/MWh, a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$215 million, and a GHG reduction potential of 41,195.2 tCO(2) /year. Port Harcourt (lat. 4.75 degrees N, lon. 7.00 degrees E) was the least favorable location with electricity production estimated at 108,309 MWh per annum, CCF at US$389.7 million, energy production cost at US$103.10/MWh, NPV at US$40 million, and GHG reduction potential estimated at 26, 668.5 tCO(2)/year. The huge initial costs required for installing the systems could be recovered within 10.6 to 14 years at the locations considered, the estimated simple payback periods being between 11.6 and 18 years. An average GHG reduction payment of US$265/tCO(2) is recommended to improve the profitability of the solar PV plants in Nigeria.

TI  - Designing of the Integral, Cascade and Hybrid Use Scheme, for the Kozani-8 Geothermal Water; Some Thermal and Economical Calculations
VL  - 3
SP  - 291-298
AB  - Albania is relatively rich with low up to the middle enthalpy, geothermal resources. Their temperature varies from 34 degrees C up to 65.5 degrees C to Kozani-8, the most important among the Albanian geothermal wells. It had been drilled in 1989. The well is located on the hills, 26km SE of Tirana. It encounters limestone strata at 1819m, penetrating 10m into the section. The yield of the well is 10.3 l/s, and is stable from more than 23 years. The geographical position of the well, placed in the middle of a village, very close to the corridor 8, are the basic parameters on choosing these waters for our designs and calculations. The design provides the cascade and integral use, but not only. It also provide the electricity generations, through a hybrid system. The centre will be also equipped with SPA, open and closed pools, fitness, massages, and greenhouse & also aquaculture pools. The economic analyses shows that this resource is completely competitive, and is unjustified it's further "waste". It will also help on improving the living standards for the local community.

TI  - Contribution of the wood-processing industry for sustainable power generation: Viability of biomass-fuelled cogeneration in Sub-Saharan Africa
VL  - 120
SP  - 324-331
AB  - Energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains a challenging issue at the midway point to the United Nations' development goals. From the perspective of energy efficiency and diversification of power-generation sources, this paper investigates the capacity of the wood-processing industry to contribute to the decentralised power generation by performing a techno-economic analysis of the use of wood residues for cogeneration. Using a survey performed in Cameroon as a case study, a biomass-fuelled cogeneration scheme and a model analysing its viability are proposed for the specific context of SSA. A sensitivity analysis indicates for a given process efficiency of the industry, the attractiveness of cogeneration as the processing capacity and feed-in tariffs of electricity increase. More specifically, the threshold of feed-in tariffs ensuring the economic viability of CHP in the sub-region is estimated at $0.15 per kWh for mills where the output capacities of sawn timber products are of 5000 cubic metre per annum and more. The power-generation potential from the primary processing of timbers in the sub-region is about 388 kWh per cubic metre of sawn wood, while the energy intensity of the sawing process is estimated at 132 kWh per cubic metre. Therefore, the industry can generate up to 2472 GWh of electricity in the three sub-regions of East, West and Central Africa if a total of US$ 2.5 billion is invested, allowing a substantial increase of 1% of the current electricity-generation capacity for the geographic location which has the most important forestry resources on the continent.

TI  - Viability analysis of centralized hydrogen generation plant for use in mobility sector
VL  - 43
IS  - 26
SP  - 11793-11802
AB  - Nowadays, the use of renewable energy sources is one of the keys to achieve the sustainable development of societies. The intensive use of fossil fuels has caused effects in the environment and the human health. Greenhouse gas emissions and the carcinogenic effect of diesel are widely demonstrated. The production of clean energy based on renewable sources and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector in general and as an alternative fuel in particular represent a technically feasible reality. However, it is necessary to study the economic variables of centralized or distributed production of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. The aim of this paper is to analyze the technical and economic viability of a centralized generation hydrogen plant for mobility use. It was performed a sensitivity analysis of main parameters such as size of hydrogen production plant, operating hours of the plant, investment costs of the main equipment and electricity price. A NPV of 1,272,692 and a 9-year pay-back were obtained for a centralized hydrogen production plant of 2 MW, considering commercial values of the main evaluation parameters. The sensitivity analysis determines that the main variables affecting the NPV are the price of electricity and the operating hours of the plant. With 95% of confidence, the NPV will be positive with an 80.19% of certainty. Therefore, centralized hydrogen production represents a technically viable, environmentally friendly and economically attractive process that can rapidly position hydrogen as an alternative fuel for mobility.

TI  - Increased anthocyanin content in purple pericarp x blue aleurone wheat crosses
VL  - 132
IS  - 6
SP  - 546-552
AB  - Due to their antioxidant activity, anthocyanins are of increasing interest for nutritionists, food scientists and plant breeders. Anthocyanins in wheat grains are expressed in either the pericarp or aleurone layer. Previous studies revealed that different anthocyanins are present in wheat varieties carrying genes for either the purple pericarp or the blue aleurone trait. Progeny from crosses between red-, purple- and blue-grained wheat varieties were selected over several cycles for grain colour by visual scoring. Bulked F-5 grains were evaluated for their total anthocyanin content by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and HPLC-MS. The results demonstrate that it is possible to increase the anthocyanin content by the combination of the different genetic backgrounds for purple pericarp and blue aleurone, even though the majority of progeny were within the range of the purple- and blue-grained check varieties. Visual scoring for grain colour is efficient, reliable and fast for selection in early breeding generations. Advanced breeding lines with high anthocyanin content can be identified by simple extraction methods and spectrophotometric measurements.

TI  - Eggsac development rates and phenology of agrobiont linyphiid spiders in relation to temperature
VL  - 109
IS  - 2
SP  - 89-100
AB  - Spider densities are often low after winter in annual crops, and crop management decimates spider populations several times per year. Population recovery rates and phenology depend on reproductive and development rates, which in turn are driven largely by temperature. We aimed to quantify the relationships between eggsac development rates and temperature in order to understand the relative value of different linyphiid species for the biological control of agricultural pests. Female adults of nine linyphiid species were collected from winter wheat in the UK over 3 years; Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall), Erigone atra ( Blackwall), Erigone dentipalpis ( Wider), Erigone promiscua O. P.- Cambridge), Tenuiphantes tenuis ( Blackwall) [ formerly Lepthyphantes tenuis ( Blackwall)], Meioneta rurestris ( C. L. Koch), Oedothorax apicatus ( Blackwall), Oedothorax fuscus ( Blackwall), and Oedothorax retusus (Westring). These are agrobiont species that are dominant in agroecosystems. We tested how well development in the field can be predicted on the basis of laboratory experiments. We also built a simple phenology simulation model to test whether spider phenology in the field can be predicted by a general knowledge of the relationship between temperature and development rate. The relationships between temperature and development rates of eggsacs were not linear as described by a day-degree model, but exponential as described by a biophysical model. Duration of the eggsac development period in the field was predicted accurately from laboratory experiments. We only found minor differences between development thresholds of eggsacs at constant temperatures compared with fluctuating temperatures. The phenology model predicted the phenology of L. tenuis and E. atra well, but the number of generations predicted for O. fuscus was not realised in the field. This suggests that development of this species may be affected by factors other than temperature. The methods used here could also be applied to other natural enemies, to determine whether their thermal biology is conducive to a role as biocontrol agents in disturbed agricultural systems.

AB  - This work is alined at evaluating the optimal location of three discrete heat Sources Which Could be placed anywhere inside a ventilated cavity and cooled by forced convection. The computational domain involves a square cavity with adiabatic walls, diagonally opposite inlet and outlet, with a heat flux of 1000 W/m(2) oil the heat sources and constant velocity of 4 m/s at the inlet. The two dimensional flow and temperature fields are obtained by performing simulations oil FLUENT 6.3. The micro genetic algorithm (MGA) using the six coordinates of the heat sources as input parameters and 5 individuals in it population is used for the optimization, with the objective function as minimizing the maximum temperature oil any of the heat sources. Initially for 66 generations, simulations were repeatedly done to evaluate the objective function. This data was used to train a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) using the Bayesian regularization algorithm to predict the fitness from the Six inputs. This trained ANN was integrated with the micro genetic algorithm to evolve the Population for 1000 generations to arrive at the global optimum. Sensitivity studies have been carried out oil the optimal solution by varying file Reynolds number. This study shows that by integrating ANN with GA, the computational time call be reduced substantially in problems of this class. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gene pleiotropy constrains gene expression changes in fish adapted to different thermal conditions
VL  - 5
AB  - Understanding the factors that shape the evolution of gene expression is a central goal in biology, but the molecular mechanisms behind this remain controversial. A related major goal is ascertaining how such factors may affect the adaptive potential of a species or population. Here we demonstrate that temperature-driven gene expression changes in fish adapted to differing thermal environments are constrained by the level of gene pleiotropy estimated by either the number of protein interactions or gene biological processes. Genes with low pleiotropy levels were the main drivers of both plastic and evolutionary global expression profile changes, while highly pleiotropic genes had limited expression response to temperature treatment. Our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms by which natural populations can adapt to changing environments. In addition to having important implications for climate change adaptation, these results suggest that gene pleiotropy should be considered more carefully when interpreting expression profiling data.

TI  - Photoperiod is an important seasonal selection factor in Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae)
VL  - 135
IS  - 2
SP  - 277-290
AB  - Most organisms respond and can adapt to photoperiodic changes. This affects measurable end points like developmental time, survival and fertility. For ectotherms like Chironomus riparius, temperature is the most studied environmental cue regulating their life cycle, whereas photoperiodic influence is neglected. However, the developmental speed between summer and winter seasons of a field population could not be explained solely by temperature variations. Therefore, to have a comprehensive view on how photoperiods influence chironomid's life cycle, we investigated if it plays a role in their development and if it acts as an important selective pressure on developmental time speed. To this end, first emerged C. riparius were artificially selected for seven generations. Pre-selected and unselected organisms could develop and breed independently under three light regimes: constant light (24:0 L:D), long days (16:8 L:D) and short days (8:16 L:D). Adult emergence, mean and median emergence time and fertility were integrated into the population growth rate to compare fitness. Our findings show that although developmental time is extended under short days, this same condition may exert a selective pressure towards a shorter development. Moreover, by also using photoperiodic clues to anticipate environmental changes, chironomids can potentially adapt to alterations in climate.

TI  - Biology, thermal requirements, and estimation of the number of generations of Zaprionus indianus (Diptera : Drosophilidae) for the main fig producing regions of Brazil
VL  - 90
IS  - 3
SP  - 495-501
AB  - The African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, was first recorded in fig orchards in Brazil in 1999, at the Valinhos region, in the State of Sao Paulo. In view of the scarcity of biological data on this insect in Brazil, the objective of this research was to study the biology, temperature requirements, and to estimate the number of Z. indianus annual generations for the main fig producing regions of Brazil, aimed at controlling the pest. The insects were reared on artificial diet at constant temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, and 32 degrees C, relative humidity 80 +/- 10%, and 14-h photophase. Duration of the development stages was variable with temperature, being longer at the lower temperatures. Temperature also influenced viability during the larval and pupal stages and the egg-adult biological cycle, with significant differences between 32 degrees C and the other temperature conditions. The lower temperature development threshold (TT) and thermal constant (K) values for the egg, larval, and pupal stages were 9.7 and 10.5; 9.2 and 148.6, and 10.7 degrees C and 66.25 DD, respectively, for a total thermal constant of 262.2 DD for the egg-adult biological cycle. Based on a lower temperature development threshold of 7.9 degrees C., Z. indianus may have up to 16.6, 12.4, and 12.7 annual generations in the regions of Valinhos-SP, Pelotas-RS, and Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso-MG, respectively, which are traditionally known as fig producing regions in the country.

AB  - Development of molecular genetic markers provides aquaculture with tools for a number of research and practical applications. Genetic marking of experimental groups allows their evaluation in the same rearing units, increasing statistical power within limited research infrastructure. Parentage can be inferred for individuals in mixed-progeny groups, quantifying the contributions of individual parents and supporting the estimation of sire and dam effects. Building upon parentage assignment, walk-back selection entails retention of the best members of each family as broodstock for the next generation. Molecular markers can be used to detect the segregation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and knowledge of such linkages can be used for marker-assisted selection. Gene expression profiling can identify genes affecting traits of interest, providing candidates for QTL or functional analysis. Purposeful genetic marking can be used to identify proprietary stocks, marketed products, and fish out-planted or escaping into natural ecosystems. Although each application has been demonstrated, genetic markers are not routinely used in commercial aquaculture. The limited practical application can be explained by the limited development of broodstocks; for most aquaculture species, the small size and limited scope of most aquaculture operations, and the costs of genetic screening.

TI  - Framework of model selection criteria approximated genetic programming for optimization function for renewable energy systems
VL  - 59
AB  - For the realization of complex renewable energy systems (such as nano-fluids based direct absorption solar collector), an evolutionary system identification method such as genetic programming (GP) can be applied to develop mathematical models/functional relationships between the process parameters. The system complexity is attributed to interaction among the design variables influencing the outputs. There are also uncertainties in the system due to random and unknown variations in the design and response variables. GP suffers from the higher complexity structure of its solutions and non-optimal convergence, which leads to poor fitness values. Therefore, to address these uncertainties and problems, the framework based on the model selection criteria approximated genetic programming (MSC-GP) is proposed for the formulation of geometry design based thermal efficiency and entropy generation optimization function for direct absorption solar collector (DASC) system. In this proposed method, the four mathematical model selection criteria are used as an approximation for objective functions in GP framework for the evaluation of fitting degree and structure of the model. The results based on statistical measures (best fitness, mean fitness, standard deviation of fitness, number of nodes) show that models obtained from the mathematical selection criteria, Predicted Residual error sum of squares (PRESS), have performed the best. Based on Pareto front analysis of PRESS function, it is found that the best objective values and the number of nodes of models (complexity) follows more or less gradually slow increasing trend which is a good symbolic desirable sign of minimal increase of complexity of model with a decrease in objective values as the values of generation increases. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the main factor affecting the efficiency of DASC is its geometry of the structure. 3-D interaction analysis shows that increasing the thickness, length and reducing the width of the collector can make the system maintain its higher thermal efficiency and a smaller entropy generation, which is useful for the optimized operation of DASC. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied in the acquisition of the optimal geometric settings of DASC system based on the selected models. The optimal settings achieved is 5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 2 cm in thickness. Systems when operated using these settings results in a satisfactory performance with 77.8117% in thermal efficiency and 6.0004E + 3 in entropy generation).

VL  - 24

SP  - 430-439
AB  - Variation in climate, particularly temperature, is known to affect the genetic composition of populations. Although there have been many studies of latitudinal variation, comparisons of populations across altitudes or seasons, particularly for animal species, are less common. Here, we study genetic variation (microsatellite markers) in populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected along altitudinal gradients and in different seasons. We found no differences in genetic variation between 2 years or between seasons within years. However, there were numerous cases of significant associations between allele frequencies or expected heterozygosities and altitude, with more than half showing nonlinear relationships. While these associations indicate possible selection and local altitudinal adaptation, direct tests gave strong evidence for selection affecting two loci and weaker evidence for five other loci. Two loci that are located within an inversion (including the one with strongest evidence for selection) show a linear increase in genetic diversity with altitude, likely due to thermal selection. Parallel associations with altitude here and with latitude in Australian populations indicate that selection is operating on chromosomal regions marked by some of the loci.

TI  - Thermal adaptation in the intertidal snail Echinolittorina malaccana contradicts current theory by revealing the crucial roles of resting metabolism
VL  - 214
IS  - 21
SP  - 3649-3657
AB  - Contemporary theory for thermal adaptation of ectothermic metazoans focuses on the maximization of energy gain and performance (locomotion and foraging). Little consideration is given to the selection for mechanisms that minimize resting energy loss in organisms whose energy gain is severely constrained. We tested a hypothetical framework for thermal performance of locomotor activity (a proxy for energy gain) and resting metabolism (a proxy for energy loss) in energetically compromised snails in the littoral fringe zone, comparing this with existing theory. In contrast to theory, the thermal ranges and optima for locomotor performance and metabolic performance of Echinolittorina malaccana are mismatched, and energy gain is only possible at relatively cool temperatures. To overcome thermal and temporal constraints on energy gain while experiencing high body temperatures (23-50 degrees C), these snails depress resting metabolism between 35 and 46 degrees C (thermally insensitive zone). The resulting bimodal relationship for metabolism against temperature contrasts with the unimodal or exponential relationships of most ectotherms. Elevation of metabolism above the breakpoint temperature for thermal insensitivity (46 degrees C) coincides with the induction of a heat shock response, and has implications for energy expenditure and natural selection. Time-dependent mortality is initiated at this breakpoint temperature, suggesting a threshold above which the rate of energy demand exceeds the capacity for cellular energy generation (rate of ATP turnover). Mortality in a thermal range that elevates rather than limits aerobic metabolism contrasts with the hypothesis that cellular oxygen deficiency underlies temperature-related mortality. The findings of this study point to the need to incorporate aspects of resting metabolism and energy conservation into theories of thermal adaptation.

VL  - 23

AB  - The ability of populations to adapt to environmental change and the spatial scale at which this adaptation occurs are fundamentally important issues in evolutionary biology, and ones that may benefit greatly from the study of genetic variability in reaction norms, which represent the plasticity of phenotypic traits across an environmental gradient. Therefore variable reaction norms can reflect genetic differences in the ability of individuals, families, populations, and species to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Fishes are ideal organisms in which to study plasticity because of their remarkable intraspecific morphological, physiological, behavioural, and life history variation. Here, we review studies demonstrating genetic variability in reaction norms in fishes. Genetic variability in plasticity among full- and half-sib families suggests potential for some populations to develop an adaptive norm of reaction (recalling that plasticity need not be adaptive). Reaction norm variability among populations suggests that adaptive genetic divergence can occur rapidly when selection pressures are strong and that the spatial scale of adaptation is much smaller than previously believed for some species with high dispersal capabilities. These studies demonstrate the potential of using reaction norms to study the evolution of novel phenotypes and the influence of temporal environmental variability and gene flow on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which can then be used to predict how populations will respond to directional environmental change. To promote future research into genetic variability in reaction norms, we propose questions that would benefit from such an approach and discuss some important considerations for designing experiments to investigate questions related to genetic variation in plasticity and phenotypic evolution.

TI  - Stress for invasion success? Temperature stress of preceding generations modifies the response to insecticide stress in an invasive pest insect
VL  - 6
IS  - 2
SP  - 313-323
AB  - Adaptation to stressful environments is one important factor influencing species invasion success. Tolerance to one stress may be complicated by exposure to other stressors experienced by the preceding generations. We studied whether parental temperature stress affects tolerance to insecticide in the invasive Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Field-collected pyrethroid-resistant beetles were reared under either stressful (17 degrees C) or favourable (23 degrees C) insecticide-free environments for three generations. Then, larvae were exposed to pyrethroid insecticides in common garden conditions (23 degrees C). Beetles were in general tolerant to stress. The parental temperature stress alone affected beetles positively (increased adult weight) but it impaired their tolerance to insecticide exposure. In contrast, offspring from the favourable temperature regime showed compensatory weight gain in response to insecticide exposure. Our study emphasizes the potential of cross-generational effects modifying species stress tolerance. When resistant pest populations invade benign environments, a re-application of insecticides may enhance their performance via hormetic effects. In turn, opposite effects may arise if parental generations have been exposed to temperature stress. Thus, the outcome of management practices of invasive pest species is difficult to predict unless we also incorporate knowledge of the evolutionary and recent (preceding generations) stress history of the given populations into pest management.

TI  - Sex-Dependent Cold Tolerance at the Northern Invasive Range Limit of Gambusia affinis on Cape Cod, Massachusetts
VL  - 108
IS  - 3
SP  - 670-678
AB  - Many invasive species may be constrained in their ability to invade high latitude or elevation habitats due to limits of cold tolerance. However, isolated populations at the edge of these species' geographic ranges may face a combination of strong selection and lack of maladaptive gene flow that allows them to adapt to the cold and invade further. Here we show that an isolated population of Gambusia affinis (on Cape Cod, MA, USA), one of the most invasive fish in the world, can survive temperatures lower than any reported tolerances for other populations, with large, long-lived females showing more tolerance than males. Indeed, male acute cold tolerance appears insufficient, suggesting the population may persist through winters mainly via the ability of mated females to delay offspring production until spring. This combination of female cold tolerance and life history may open the door for further expansion of this invasive species into high latitude freshwater habitats.

TI  - Genetic Algorithm Design of a 3D Printed Heat Sink
SP  - 3529-3536
AB  - In this paper, a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based approach is discussed for designing heat sinks based on total heat generation and dissipation for a pre-specified size and shape. This approach combines random iteration processes and genetic algorithms with finite element analysis (FEA) to design the optimized heat sink. With an approach that prefers "survival of the fittest", a more powerful heat sink can be designed which can cool power electronics more efficiently. Some of the resulting designs can only be 3D printed due to their complexity. In addition to describing the methodology, this paper also includes comparisons of different cases to evaluate the performance of the newly designed heat sink compared to commercially available heat sinks.

TI  - Impact of large-scale rooftop solar PV integration: An algorithm for hydrothermal-solar scheduling (HTSS)
VL  - 157
SP  - 988-1004
AB  - Hydrothermal scheduling is a standard problem in the operation of power systems. With the integration of renewable resources, like solar and/or wind to the existing hydro-thermal system, there is a need for a dedicated approach for long-term generation scheduling of the integrated system. Long-term generation scheduling of hydro-thermal-solar systems at the grid level has not been reported so far. This paper discusses a Hydrothermal-Solar Scheduling (HTSS) algorithm for the same. The algorithm is a two-stage formulation using dynamic programming and linear programming techniques. This generic methodology can be used for assessing the impact of large-scale rooftop solar-PV integration with a hydrothermal system, in terms of the electricity energy mix, generation schedules and the annual generation-costs of the concerned system. It has been illustrated by application to the problem of integration of a large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario with the existing Mumbai sub-system. The results show a significantly higher annual generation-cost saving, achieved by integrating the large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario via the proposed HTSS algorithm. The benefits, however, reduce with increasing penetrations of solar in the electricity energy-mix. The annual generation-cost savings have also been used for estimating the upper cap on feed-in tariffs for solar generation, and the financial viability indicators for the large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario; the corresponding internal rate of return is found to decline from 18.4% to 16.6% as the share of solar-PV in the electricity energy-mix of Mumbai increases from 2.8% to 13.9%.

VL  - 16

SP  - 4343-4351
AB  - Cane trash could viably substitute fossil fuels in heat and power generation projects to avoid air pollution from open burning and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. It is competitive with bituminous and other agro-industrial biomass. Using cane trash for heat generation project could provide a higher reliability and return on investment than power generation project. The heat generation project could be viable (Financial Internal Rate of Return, FIRR = 36-81%) without feedstock subsidy. With current investment and support conditions, the capacity of 5 MW option of power generation project is the most viable (FIRR = 13.6-15.3%); but 30 MW, 1 MW and 10 MW options require feedstock subsidy 450-1100 Baht/t-cane trash to strengthen financial viability. Furthermore, the revenue from carbon credit sales could compensate the revenue from current energy price adder and increases 0.5-1.0% FIRR of power generation project. Using cane trash for 1 MW power generation could reduce GHG emission 637-861 t CO(2)eq and avoid air pollutant emissions of 3.35 kg nitrogen oxides (NOx), 0.41 kg sulfur oxides (SOx) and 2.05 kg volatile organic compounds (VOC). Also, it steam generation from cane trash could avoid pollutant emissions of 0.6 kg NOx, 0.07 kg SOx, and 0.37 kg VOC. The potential of cane trash to cause fouling/slagging as well as erosion are not significantly different from other biomass, but chlorinated organic compounds and NOx could be higher than bituminous and current biomass feedstock at sugar mill (bagasse and rice husk).

TI  - Solar-generated steam for oil recovery: Reservoir simulation, economic analysis, and life cycle assessment
VL  - 77
SP  - 721-732
AB  - The viability of solar thermal steam generation for thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) in heavy-oil sands was evaluated using San Joaquin Valley, CA data. The effectiveness of solar TEOR was quantified through reservoir simulation, economic analysis, and life-cycle assessment. Reservoir simulations with continuous but variable rate steam injection were compared with a base-case Tulare Sand steamflood project. For equivalent average injection rates, comparable breakthrough times and recovery factors of 65% of the original oil in place were predicted, in agreement with simulations in the literature. Daily cyclic fluctuations in steam injection rate do not greatly impact recovery. Oil production rates do, however, show seasonal variation. Economic viability was established using historical prices and injection/production volumes from the Kern River oil field. For comparison, this model assumes that present day steam generation technologies were implemented at TEOR startup in 1980. All natural gas cogeneration and 100% solar fraction scenarios had the largest and nearly equal net present values (NPV) of $12.54 B and $12.55 B, respectively. Solar fraction refers to the steam provided by solar steam generation. Given its large capital cost, the 100% solar case shows the greatest sensitivity to discount rate and no sensitivity to natural gas price. Because there are very little emissions associated with day-to-day operations from the solar thermal system, life-cycle emissions are significantly lower than conventional systems even when the embodied energy of the structure is considered. We estimate that less than 1 g of CO2/MJ of refined gasoline results from the TEOR stage of production if solar energy provides all steam. By this assessment, solar thermal or supplemental solar generation systems appear to be a preferred alternative to fully conventional systems using natural gas in areas with large solar insolation.

AB  - Laboratory studies of coke breeze distribution in iron ore sinter charges were carried out with the objective to get sinters having metallurgical properties which are improved versus those generally achieved with a homogeneous coke breeze distribution in the charge which is being preferred for heat generation in sintering. The produced sinters were,subjected to shatter and reduction tests as well as to chemical and petrographic studies. Conclusions drawn showed that a concentration of the lower charge layer to a coke breeze of 10-to-15% by weight yielded a sinter cake having a higher strength and productivity than that of a relevant sinter cake having been produced from a charge with a homogeneous coke breeze distribution.

TI  - Thermal responses of workers during summer: An outdoor investigation of construction sites in South China
VL  - 66
AB  - Extreme thermal environments harm the health and reduce the productivity of outdoor workers. Variations in human physiological indices and the thermal exposure time limit are the main factors in evaluating heat safety in an extreme thermal environment. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the relationships between human physiological indices, psychological responses, and thermal parameters to accurately predict and evaluate human thermal safety in extreme thermal environments. A field survey, including thermal parameter measurements, was conducted at construction sites in South China during the summer of 2019. The relationship between health risk and thermal parameters was obtained, and the adaptability and sensitivity of workers to i) thermal parameters (outdoor ambient temperature (T-a), mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), wind speed (V-a\), and relative humidity (RH)) and ii) physiological indicators (heart rate (HR) and auditory canal temperature (ACT)), as well as the variations in their cognitive ability, were analyzed. The results indicate that 40 % of workers experienced discomfort and that when T-a>34 degrees C, the working intensity of workers needs to be reduced in construction sites. The HR and ACT increased with increasing working hours, and the thermal parameters and cognitive ability decreased. To avoid discomfort, it is suggested that the HR may be kept near 94 beats/min. The effects of physiological indicators and cognitive ability on the physical and mental state of the workers were significant; with an increase in thermal environment parameters, the efficiency decreased by approximately 8%. The results of this investigation are beneficial for ensuring the occupational safety of workers and reducing the risk of heat exposure.

VL  - 48

AB  - Six lines of the bacterium Escherichia coli were propagated for 2,000 generations in a temporally varying environment. The imposed environmental regime consisted of alternating days at 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C, with rapid transitions between them. These derived lines are competitively superior to their ancestor in this variable temperature regime. We also measured changes in the fitness of these lines, relative to their common ancestor, in both the constant (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) and transition (from 32 degrees C to 42 degrees C and from 42 degrees C to 32 degrees C) components of this temporally varying environment, to determine whether the bacteria had adapted to the particular constant temperatures or the transitions between them, or both. The experimentally evolved lines had significantly improved fitness in each of the constant environmental components (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C). However, the experimental lines had not improved in making the sudden temperature transitions that were a potentially important aspect of the temporally variable environment. In fact, fitness in making at least one of the transitions (between 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) unexpectedly decreased. This reduced adaptation to the abrupt transitions between these temperatures is probably a pleiotropic effect of mutations that were responsible for the increased fitness at the component temperatures. Among the six experimental lines, significant heterogeneity occurred in their adaptation to the constant and transition components of the variable environment.

VL  - 54

SP  - 1409-1423
AB  - Adult-overwintering insects show diversity in the occurrence of reproductive diapause of males. Mating can occur both before and after winter in different species, and pre-winter mating allows males to reproduce without overwintering. In a pierid butterfly, Eurema mandarina, both diapause and non-diapause male adults emerge in the late autumn generation. Diapause females mate with non-diapause males before winter and re-mate with diapause males the following spring. Although this species is distributed from sub-tropical regions to cool-temperate regions, the geographic variation of this characteristic mating system has not been examined. A rearing experiment and a field survey were conducted to determine the geographic patterns of the mating system of the late autumn generation of E. mandarina for various populations from sub-tropical to cool temperate regions. Non-diapause males were observed in the late autumn generation in all populations examined. The frequency of pre-winter mating of females was not correlated with latitude. These results show that the mating system of the late autumn generation is similar among various populations distributed over a wider range, suggesting that the characteristic mating system may be evolutionarily stable.

AB  - This work studies the economic feasibility of using a hybrid solar energy system to satisfy the thermal demand in industrial processes. From an artificial intelligence perspective, a modeling and computational optimization methodology was developed for the design of a hybrid solar thermal plant. Modeling is applied to satisfy the needs of a pasteurization process in the region of Jalisco, Mexico. Scenarios with four different types of fossil fuels used in the backup system were analyzed. According to the optimization results, all the backup fossil fuel scenarios demonstrate economic viability. Furthermore, the present value studies indicate that under the appropriate climatic conditions, for the four auxiliary fuel scenarios, the optimization methodology can produce economically attractive configurations of the solar thermal plant for investors. The presented methodological procedure can be easily adapted and used to analyze the financial competitiveness of other solar thermal technologies for the industrial heat generation.

TI  - Comparison of beach temperatures in the nesting range of Kemp's ridley sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico and USA
VL  - 40
SP  - 31-40
AB  - Rising environmental temperatures associated with climate change can adversely affect sea turtles whose hatchling sex determination is temperature-dependent. One hypothetical response of sea turtles to near-future elevated temperatures is a shift in nesting distribution to maintain suitable thermal conditions. Assessing sea turtle responses to climate warming involves evaluating (1) how temperatures will be altered, (2) a species' capacity to respond to changes, and (3) whether responses can mitigate the impacts of warming. We evaluated sand temperatures across nesting habitat of the Critically Endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys kempii in the western Gulf of Mexico. Most nesting now occurs on a 30 km stretch of beach in Tamaulipas, Mexico, but was historically more widely distributed. Applying conservative projections, we assessed whether a shift in the epicenter of nesting to the northern extent of the present distribution would maintain incubation temperatures below lethal levels and suitable to produce hatchlings of both sexes. Coupling temperature measurements with known impacts of temperature on the reproductive physiology of L. kempii, we predict that northern beaches will initially support the production of mixed sex ratios. However, the rapid rate of warming and long generation time for L. kempii make a shift in nesting unlikely to ultimately mitigate the effects of elevated temperatures on hatchling sex ratios and mortality. The limited thermal profile of the restricted L. kempii nesting range, and temperature-dependent sex determination, make this sea turtle particularly vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability provides the opportunity to gain insights on strategies for the survival of thermally sensitive species in a warming world.

AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive assessment of methods for the creation of weather variables for use in building simulation. We undertake a critical analysis of the fundamental issues and limitations of each methodology and discusses new challenges, such as how to deal with uncertainty, the urban heat island, climate change and extreme events. Proposals for the next generation of weather files for building simulation are made based on this analysis. A seven-point list of requirements for weather files is introduced and the state-of-the-art compared to this via a mapping exercise. It is found that there are various issues with all current and suggested approaches, but the two areas most requiring attention are the production of weather files for the urban landscape and files specifically designed to test buildings against the criteria of morbidity, mortality and building services system failure.Practical application: Robust weather files are key to the design of sustainable, healthy and comfortable buildings. This article provides the first comprehensive assessment of their technical requirements to ensure buildings perform well in both current and future climates.

VL  - 1

SP  - 976-985
AB  - Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable natural resource available. Materials for solar photothermal energy conversion are highly sought after for their cost savings, clean environment, and broad utility in providing water heating and/or steam for many applications including domestic water heating and solar-driven desalination. Water desalination via solar steam generation is considered one of the most important technologies to address the increasing pressing global water scarcity. The current solar thermal systems rely on the use of copper or aluminum for absorbers which have limited utility because of their inflexibility for tailored applications, high cost, and limited availability. These bulk metals are not very efficient in absorbing the solar spectrum. Therefore, the current solar thermal desalination devices have low efficiency and low water productivity due to the ineffectiveness of solar collectors to convert most of the sun energy into heat. Herein, we report the development of a new generation of highly efficient, flexible, low weight, highly porous, and cost-effective plasmonic graphene polyurethane (PGPU) nanocomposite materials for solar steam generation through the efficient evaporation of surface water pools. The PGPU nanocomposites contain metallic nanoparticles that exhibit very strong solar absorption. The metal nanoparticles (0.2 wt %) incorporated within the 0.5 wt % graphene oxide (GO)-polyurethane (GOPU) nanocomposites absorb sunlight much more efficiently than bulk metals or carbon materials. Subsequent nonradiative relaxation causes absorbed energy to be converted into heat which can be controlled by the size, shape, and organization of the metal nanoparticles within the PGPU materials. The polyurethane (PU) foam provides a hydrophilic surface with abundant microporous structure, excellent thermal insulation properties, and facile and scalable synthesis. The PGPU nanocomposites are produced as porous foams that float on top of the evaporating water pools which significantly enhance the absorption of the solar energy and the high solar thermal conversion efficiency. The PGPU nanocomposites containing 0.2 wt % Au and Ag nanoparticles are demonstrated to be among the most efficient solar thermal converters reported to date for solar water desalination. The Au/Ag-PGPU foams exhibit average water evaporation rates of 1.00, 6.59, and 11.34 kg m(-2) h(-1) with superb solar thermal efficiencies of up to 63%, 88%, and 96.5%, under 1, 5, and 8 sun illumination, respectively. Furthermore, the PGPU foams display stable evaporation rates over more than 10 repeated evaporation cycles without any performance decline. The high solar thermal evaporation efficiency, excellent stability, and long-time durability make the PGPU nanocomposites excellent candidates for applications in solar steam generation and seawater desalination.

AB  - Brine is usually exist in the oil reservoir. Varying salinity brine are used as stimulants for heavy oil recovery processes using electromagnetic induction heating. The heated heavy oil is floating on top of the brine since it becomes less viscous and lighter. As the temperature increased, more heavy oil is "produced/recovered". An increasing salinity of brine will result in more recovery of heavy oil

AB  - Data from nine studies were compiled to evaluate the effects of selection for postweaning weight on some carcass characteristics in experimental herds of selected Nellore (NeS), control Nellore (NeC), Caracu (CaS), Guzerah (GuS) and Gir (GiS) breeds from Instituto de Zootecnia genetic selection program. After the feeding performance test ( 168 days after weaning), samples of bulls (n= 490) from the progeny groups born between 1992 and 2000 were selected for finishing period and slaughtered. Treatments were different across studies. Meta-analysis was conducted with a random coefficients model in which herd was considered a fixed effect and treatments within year and progeny groups as random effects. Slaughter, empty body, hot carcass and cold carcass weights were higher for NeS and CaS, intermediate for GuS and lower for NeC e GiS. CaS bulls had higher proportions of forequarter and spare ribs and lower proportion of hindquarter than the other groups. No significant differences were found for percentage of edible portion among the genetic groups. Selection for postweaning weight in Nellore increased carcass, hindquarter, forequarter, and spare ribs weights without altering dressing percentage, carcass quarter, and hindquarter prime meat cuts proportions.

AB  - An operation of a brake at robust thermal loads leads to high-temperature gradients in brake components. This in turn may induce thermal stresses due to thermal expansion. In this article, both uncoupled and coupled problems of thermoelasticity for the frictional heat generation in disk brakes and clutches using the finite element method are presented and analyzed. The article covers a wide range of studies providing the concluding remarks and key factors affecting a change in the distribution of stresses in different types of the disk brakes and clutches, operating parameters, materials, etc.

TI  - Temperature and the effects of elemental food quality on Daphnia
VL  - 56
IS  - 7
SP  - 1447-1455
AB  - 1. We examined the responses of two species of Daphnia to changes in food phosphorus (P) content, with animals reared at three different water temperatures. Specifically, we measured mass-specific growth rate (MSGR), body P content and respiration rate of Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex acclimatised to 10, 17.5 and 25 degrees C and fed food carbon : phosphorus (C : P) ratios of either 150 or 500. 2. The responses of these three physiological variables to temperature-food quality interactions were species-specific. There was a significant interactive effect of temperature and food quality on D. magna, as the greatest proportional effect of food quality on growth was observed at 10 degrees C and reductions in body P because of low food P content were relatively greater at 25 degrees C. These effects may reflect the temperature dependence of mechanisms that reduce elemental constraints associated with food quality in D. magna. By contrast, there were no interactive effects between food quality and temperature on MSGR, body P or mass-specific respiration of D. pulex. 3. It thus appears that temperature can alter food quality effects on Daphnia but the nature of these alterations depends upon the daphniid species and its thermal adaptability. Significant temperature-food quality interactions will complicate efforts to understand zooplankton nutrition in nature and warrant future consideration.

TI  - Genetically Distinct Behavioral Modules Underlie Natural Variation in Thermal Performance Curves
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
SP  - 2135-2151
AB  - Thermal reaction norms pervade organismal traits as stereotyped responses to temperature, a fundamental environmental input into sensory and physiological systems. Locomotory behavior represents an especially plastic read-out of animal response, with its dynamic dependence on environmental stimuli presenting a challenge for analysis and for understanding the genomic architecture of heritable variation. Here we characterize behavioral reaction norms as thermal performance curves for the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, using a collection of 23 wild isolate genotypes and 153 recombinant inbred lines to quantify the extent of genetic and plastic variation in locomotory behavior to temperature changes. By reducing the dimensionality of the multivariate phenotypic response with a function-valued trait framework, we identified genetically distinct behavioral modules that contribute to the heritable variation in the emergent overall behavioral thermal performance curve. Quantitative trait locus mapping isolated regions on Chromosome II associated with locomotory activity at benign temperatures and Chromosome V loci related to distinct aspects of sensitivity to high temperatures, with each quantitative trait locus explaining up to 28% of trait variation. These findings highlight how behavioral responses to environmental inputs as thermal reaction norms can evolve through independent changes to genetically distinct modular components of such complex phenotypes.

VL  - 285

AB  - Evolution depends on the acquisition of genomic mutations that increase cellular fitness. Here, we evolved Escherichia coli MG1655 cells to grow at extreme temperatures. We obtained a maximum growth temperature of 48.5 degrees C, which was not increased further upon continuous cultivation at this temperature for >600 generations. Despite a permanently induced heat shock response in thermoresistant cells, only exquisitely high GroEL/GroES levels are essential for growth at 48.5 degrees C. They depend on the presence of lysyl-tRNA-synthetase, LysU, because deletion of lysU rendered thermoresistant cells thermosensitive. Our data suggest that GroEL/GroES are especially required for the folding of mutated proteins generated during evolution. GroEL/GroES therefore appear as mediators of evolution of extremely heat-resistant E. coli cells.

TI  - Analyses of a High Pressure Ratio Intercooled Direct Brayton Helium Gas Turbine Cycle for Generation IV Reactor Power Plants
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - The intercooled cycle (IC) as an alternative to the simple cycle recuperated (SCR) and intercooled cycle recuperated (ICR) is yet to be fully analyzed for the purpose of assessing its viability for utilization within Generation IV nuclear power plants (NPPs). Although the benefits are not explicitly obvious, it offers the advantage of a very high overall pressure ratio (OPR) in the absence of a recuperator. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze various pressure ratio configurations, the effects of varying pressure ratio including sensitivity analyses of component efficiencies, ambient temperature, component losses and pressure losses on cycle efficiency, and specific work of the IC, including comparison with the SCR and ICR. Results of comparison between the IC and the SCR and ICR derived that the cycle efficiencies are greater than the IC by similar to 4% (SCR) and similar to 6% (ICR), respectively. However, the pressure losses for IC are lower when compared with the SCR and ICR. Nonetheless, heat from the turbine exit temperature of the IC can be used in a processing plant including the possibility of higher turbine entry temperatures (TETs) to significantly increase the cycle efficiency in a bid to justify the business case. The analyses intend to bring to attention an alternative to current cycle configurations for the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) and very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), where helium is the coolant. The findings are summarized by evaluating the chosen pressure ratio configurations against critical parameters and detailed comparison with the SCR and ICR.

TI  - Prospects and problems of concentrating solar power technologies for power generation in the desert regions
VL  - 53
SP  - 1106-1131
AB  - Concentrated solar power plants (CSPs) are gaining momentum due to their potential of power generation throughout the day for base load applications in the desert regions with extremely high direct normal irradiance (DNI). Among various types of the CSPs, solar tower power technologies are becoming the front runners especially in the United States and around the world with the possibility to compete with traditional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). A bibliometric analysis of the publications on the CSP systems and components since 1990 shows a total of 6400+ publications and reveals an exponential growth due to reasons that CSP systems promises a lot of potential as the future large scale power source for varied applications. This review consolidates the benefits and challenges of the CSP technologies particularly in the desert regions. Thorough literature analysis as well as the meteorological data projects the trend that the CSP systems would become a reality in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Australia, Southwestern region of the United States, Southwestern part of China and China/Mongolia border with high direct normal irradiance. However, enormous amount of support and capital investments are needed for making these CSP systems realistic as there is not much power grid network in existence. It is evident that there are multiple challenges specifically in water consumption, materials design and development for the optimum heat transfer fluid, thermal energy storage and receiver subsystems in addition to commercial viability and environmental impacts. Each of the challenges is discussed in detail and suggestions are made to address the challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 142

SP  - 589-597
AB  - The temperature-dependent development of Aproceros leucopoda Takeuchi, 1939 (Hymenoptera: Argidae), an invasive pest of elms in Europe, was studied in the laboratory on Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) at six constant temperatures (10.9, 15.0, 19.5, 23.0, 24.3 and 27.0 degrees C) and at a photoperiod of 16L:8D. The larvae of the species developed through 4-7 instars, and it was the 6th instar individuals of which continued their development at the highest rate. The developmental threshold (T-min) and the thermal constant (K) were determined by the linear model and Lactin-2 model for egg, larval, prepupal and pupal stages and one whole generation. The estimated values of T-min and K by the two models for one generation were 7.3 and 7.1 degrees C, and 426.5 and 432.7 degree-days, respectively. Based on the survival and fecundity rates, the optimal temperature range for the species may be expected to be between 15.0 and 19.5 degrees C. Allowing for the period of diapause, it was estimated that A.leucopoda might potentially develop through up to four or five generations per year in Hungary. These results may contribute to the better understanding of the biology of an invasive alien species in Europe.

TI  - Environmental heterogeneity generates opposite gene-by-environment interactions for two fitness-related traits within a population
VL  - 69

SP  - 541-550
AB  - Theory predicts that environmental heterogeneity offers a potential solution to the maintenance of genetic variation within populations, but empirical evidence remains sparse. The live-bearing fish Xiphophorus variatus exhibits polymorphism at a single locus, with different alleles resulting in up to five distinct melanistic tailspot patterns within populations. We investigated the effects of heterogeneity in two ubiquitous environmental variables (temperature and food availability) on two fitness-related traits (upper thermal limits and body condition) in two different tailspot types (wild-type and upper cut crescent). We found gene-by-environment (G x E) interactions between tailspot type and food level affecting upper thermal limits (UTL), as well as between tailspot type and thermal environment affecting body condition. Exploring mechanistic bases underlying these G x E patterns, we found no differences between tailspot types in hsp70 gene expression despite significant overall increases in expression under both thermal and food stress. Similarly, there was no difference in routine metabolic rates between the tailspot types. The reversal of relative performance of the two tailspot types under different environmental conditions revealed a mechanism by which environmental heterogeneity can balance polymorphism within populations through selection on different fitness-related traits.

TI  - Development of Surface Roughness Generation Model for CFRTP Manufactured by LFT-D
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SP  - 208-216
AB  - In this study, we propose a new surface generation model for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP) manufactured by the long fiber thermoplastic-direct (LFT-D) method. CFRTP are considered to be a next-generation structural material because of their high productivity as well as high mechanical strength and lightness. Conversely, CFRTP have a rough surface, which does not meet the automotive outer panel standard of a "class A surface." In the present study, we establish a surface roughness generation model based on a thermal shrinkage mismatch of thermoplastic resin to carbon fiber and non-uniform carbon fiber distribution. Furthermore, we construct a surface roughness estimation formula based on the model. In the calculation, a cross-sectional image of CFRTP is divided into many vertical segments. Subsequently, the thermal shrinkage of each segment is calculated with a standard deviation, an average, and a probability density of the amount of carbon fiber in each segment. The surface roughness of the manufactured CFRTP was measured using a surface profilometer. The result showed that the arithmetic surface roughness increased with the volume fraction of carbon fiber. We applied the surface roughness calculation to cross-sectional images of the specimens. Consequently, the estimated surface roughness showed the same tendency, in which the surface roughness increased with the volume fraction of carbon fiber. The slope of a regression line of the estimated surface roughness with respect to the volume fraction was 0.010, which was almost the same (0.011) as the slope of a regression line of the measured surface roughness. Furthermore, the estimation formula using a thermal shrinkage effective depth of 395 mu m was able to estimate the surface roughness within a 3% average error. Using the estimation formula, it was predicted that the surface roughness increased with the standard deviation of the amount of carbon fiber in a segment. To confirm the reliability of the model and the formula, we measured the standard deviation of the amount of carbon fiber in CFRTP specimens, showing that the trend for CFRTP specimens matched the estimated values.

TI  - A Comparison of Methods to Measure Fitness in Escherichia coli
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - In order to characterize the dynamics of adaptation, it is important to be able to quantify how a population's mean fitness changes over time. Such measurements are especially important in experimental studies of evolution using microbes. The Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli provides one such system in which mean fitness has been measured by competing derived and ancestral populations. The traditional method used to measure fitness in the LTEE and many similar experiments, though, is subject to a potential limitation. As the relative fitness of the two competitors diverges, the measurement error increases because the less-fit population becomes increasingly small and cannot be enumerated as precisely. Here, we present and employ two alternatives to the traditional method. One is based on reducing the fitness differential between the competitors by using a common reference competitor from an intermediate generation that has intermediate fitness; the other alternative increases the initial population size of the less-fit, ancestral competitor. We performed a total of 480 competitions to compare the statistical properties of estimates obtained using these alternative methods with those obtained using the traditional method for samples taken over 50,000 generations from one of the LTEE populations. On balance, neither alternative method yielded measurements that were more precise than the traditional method.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Eurasian boreal conifers
SP  - 177-187
AB  - The most important boreal conifers of Eurasia are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies incl. P. obovata) and Larches (Larix gmelinii and L. sibirica, incl. L. sukaczewii), all belonging to Pinaceae. All have a very large distribution and their ranges have contracted and expanded repeatedly under climatic changes during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Evolution has thus led to a large genetic variation and potential for reaction to environmental factors. Morphological, biochemical, molecular and adaptive variation has been observed but the mechanisms of the inheritance are only partly known. Simple patterns of inheritance are rare but negative correlations between useful characters are few. Long term provenance experiments in different conditions have revealed characters of adaptability useful in cultivation. Norway spruce seems to exceed Scots pine in genetic potential. The Larches have reacted variably. Within-population variability is in many cases considerable and for non-adaptive characters the genetic distance between populations of different geographic origin is small. The physiological mechanisms behind the adaptive features are only partly known but new experiments have thrown some light on the processes involved. Knowledge about reaction norms to climate may become important when considering the effects of a possible global warming.

VL  - 100

SP  - 1085-1103
AB  - Impoundments of free-flowing rivers for hydropower generation often confine fish to relatively small reaches that can restrict movement, limit habitat availability, and alter life history strategies. Here, acoustic telemetry was used to describe the seasonal habitat use, locomotory activity, and depth use for Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and Walleye (Sander vitreus) within an impounded reach on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Lake Sturgeon foraged and overwintered in the riverine-lacustrine transitionary habitat as well as immediately below the tailrace of the upstream run-of-river facility. Walleye demonstrated high site fidelity to the upstream habitat situated near the tailrace of a hydropower facility. Contrary to Lake Sturgeon, that used multiple habitat types, Walleye used the tailrace for spawning, foraging, and overwintering, given their high residency rates throughout all months at this location. Activity for both species increased with water temperature and when residing in habitat types located farther upstream, but were minimally active during the winter season throughout the impounded reach. On average, Lake Sturgeon utilized 73% of the available depth while Walleye utilized 62% of the available depth across habitat types and months. Overall, the habitat located within the tailrace and below run-of-river facilities should be a conservation priority for both Lake Sturgeon and Walleye populations. There was persistent presence of Lake Sturgeon and Walleye throughout the spawning, foraging, and overwintering periods in the SSGS tailrace and within the first rkm downstream of the tailrace. The habitat proximal to run-of-river facilities generally encompasses small areas of the total potential habitat within impoundments, yet is important to both species studied here. The results provide information on the seasonal habitat use and biological responses to environmental cues for Lake Sturgeon and Walleye that will enhance management and ecological understanding for populations that are confined to impounded reaches.

VL  - 29

SP  - 150-156
AB  - The root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) was reared on artificial diet under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. The Lower thermal threshold for development of neonate larvae was estimated to be 15 degrees C. The growth rate of neonate larvae increased exponentially with increasing temperature up to 30 degrees C. The growth rate of later instars, however, was suppressed at 30 degrees C and mortality was higher than that of larvae reared at 26 degrees C. Larvae reared as late instars only ( >56 d old ), or continuously at 30 degrees C, had increased mortality and produced smaller adults than larvae reared at 22 and 26 degrees C. Larvae reared as late instars only (>56 d) or continuously at 22 degrees C had similar survival rates compared with those reared at 26 degrees C, and they emerged as larger adults compared with larvae reared at 26 or 30 degrees C. The time required for development from neonate to pupation was 125 +/- 3 d (mean +/- SEM, n = 38) at 26 degrees C. Duration of the pupal stage was inversely proportional to temperature between 22 and 30 degrees C. Pupal mortality was higher at 30 degrees C than at 22 or 26 degrees C. The total time required for a single generation from oviposition to adult emergence was estimated to be 154 d at 26 degrees C and adequate humidity. Cumulative mean air and soil temperatures and rainfall for a location inr central Florida were analyzed and presented for the period October 1991 through January 1999.

TI  - Quantum random number generation using a hexagonal boron nitride single photon emitter
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
AB  - Quantum random number generation (QRNG) harnesses the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical phenomena. On-chip photonic circuitry provides a robust and versatile platform that can address and explore fundamental questions in quantum as well as classical physics. Likewise, integrated waveguide-based architectures hold the potential for intrinsically scalable, efficient and compact implementations of photonic QRNG. Here, we harness the quantum emission from the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride an emerging atomically thin medium that can generate single photons on demand while operating at room temperature. By means of a customized splitter arrangement, we achieve true random number generation through the measurement of single photons exiting one of four designated output ports, and subsequently verify the randomness of the sequences in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology benchmark suite. Our results clearly demonstrate the viability and efficiency of this approach to on-chip deterministic random number generators.

TI  - Indexer PVD Platform - The Key Enabler for High Productivity and Low Contact Resistance for Next-Generation WLP Applications
AB  - This work analyzes the key performance of two different multi-chamber PVD systems used in volume WLP manufacturing. These are the Cluster-type and the Indexer-type platforms, respectively. It is emphasized how the faster wafer handling, which is a unique characteristic of the Indexer concept, results in throughput of production flows exceeding 50 wafers/hour. Moreover, the strategies of degas, cooling and sputter-etch implemented in the process-of-records executed by Indexer allow for wafer processing at lower temperature regimes and result in 50% lower contact resistance baseline. This work reports Rc values well below 1.0 mOhm measured on single-contact Kelvin structures. The Indexer system presented promotes itself as the ideal high-productivity PVD platform capable to tackle the ever-increasing manufacturing challenges arising from the progressive shrinkage of the critical device dimensions of next-generation WLCSP and FOWLP.

AB  - Animals and plants often exhibit narrow ranges of thermal preference in variable environments; fitness-enhancing activities such as reproduction and growth tend to be concentrated during times in which body temperature lies within that narrow range. The relation between fitness-associated performance and temperature is modeled by a performance curve defined by two traits: performance breadth (T-br), a measure of thermal specialization, and the critical maximum temperature for performance (T-max). Optimality models are used to define the fitness landscape for these two traits under several different patterns of within- and among-generation variation in temperature. In constant environments and environments in which there is significant within-generation variation, specialists with narrow preference ranges are the favored phenotype. In environments in which there is considerable among-generation but little within-generation variation, generalists with broad preference ranges are favored. Specialists in a constant environment have a mean fitness an order of magnitude higher than any phenotype in more variable environments, demonstrating that homeostatic mechanisms can confer a large fitness advantage. In contrast to previous models of environmental tolerance, these performance models suggest that increasing temporal environmental variation can favor the evolution of thermal specialization.

TI  - Electrothermal performance limit of beta-Ga2O3 field-effect transistors
VL  - 115
IS  - 17
AB  - A beta-Ga2O3 field effect transistor (FET) outperforms a GaN FET in Baliga's figure of merit (FOM) by 400% and Huang's chip area manufacturing figure of merit by 330%, suggesting that beta-Ga2O3 could be a substrate of choice for next generation power transistors. However, its low thermal conductivity leads to extreme self-heating, which deteriorates the device performance during high voltage operation. A holistic evaluation of performance from a material-device-circuit perspective is necessary before reaching any conclusion regarding the technological viability of beta-Ga2O3. In this paper, we develop a multiphysics and multiscale model for a material-device-circuit analysis of beta-Ga2O3 FETs. The framework allows us to explore the effectiveness of various device design strategies (e.g., thermal shunts) for mitigating the thermal chokepoints and compare the performance of improved beta-Ga2O3 FETs against that of GaN and SiC FETs. We highlight the limitations of traditional FOMs to analyze the relative performance of the new generation of power transistors whose structure incorporates stacked layers of materials with different thermal conductivities, like those of beta-Ga2O3 FETs. We suggest device design strategies, such as wafer thinning, incorporation of heat shunts, and improved channel mobility, so that beta-Ga2O3 FETs can compete commercially with GaN and SiC technologies.

AB  - The Zero Energy Building (ZEB) target and the higher affordability of photovoltaic (PV) systems are pushing Governments and large Companies operating in electricity generation and distribution network management to develop tools able to better define the potential productivity of PV systems on a large scale, such as solar maps. However, solar maps mainly consider phenomena related to weather and geometry, with a low level of detail on second order effects. This research aims at the integration of additional technical aspects into solar maps, by means of diagrams able to increase the reliability in the assessment of potential electricity generation. For this purpose, more technical factors are taken into account, such as the variation of PV panel efficiency with cell temperature, the shadow cast by the preceding PV panel array, here including the action of by-pass diodes, and the ratio of active area over the area available for installation.

TI  - Building performance indicators and IEQ assessment procedure for the next generation of EPC-s
VL  - 246
AB  - In the current implementation of EPC-s, the assessment focus is purely on the energy consumption data. For the next generation of EPC-s, new performance indicators are proposed to address relevant building performance aspects, such as sustainability, productivity and market value. These indicators would enable evidence-based decision-making processes and facilitate the delivery of renovation triggers. Within the EPC framework, the problem is not the availability of such performance indicators, but the assessment effort required. Only easily available data can justifiably be introduced to bulk EPC-s, either as direct complementary input or as a performance indicator. Availability of such data was analysed from case studies that included EPC-s from 11 EU member states, mainly non-residential buildings. Analysed data included relevant HVAC information such as ventilation air flows, heating and cooling set-points and installed power, but also output data, such as EPC classes, net and primary energy need and GHG emissions. Based on our findings, we outlined two different development paths - one for existing buildings and one for new buildings and major renovations. Two categories of complementary indicators to energy are proposed - IEQ and power indicators.

TI  - Low Cost Data Acquisition System For Wind Prospecting
AB  - This paper describes a data logger system based on microcontroller (wind speed, wind direction, humidity and temperature) and storing data in the SD (Secure Digital) memory card. The evaluation of the wind potential available at a particular site is needed to determine the viability or not the wind turbine installation. However, data acquisition systems for wind prospecting and monitoring of the wind power plants use high cost and precision sensors (anemometer, thermo-hygrometer, wind vane). Therefore, this low cost data acquisition system presented in this paper has characteristics of some commercial data loggers and it is appropriated to study of the feasibility of the installing micro wind turbines for distributed generation.

TI  - Mate Choice Contributes to the Maintenance of Shell Color Polymorphism in a Marine Snail via Frequency-Dependent Sexual Selection
VL  - 7
AB  - Natural color polymorphisms are widespread across animal species and usually have a simple genetic basis. This makes them an ideal system to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for maintaining biodiversity. In some populations of the intertidal snail Littorina fabalis, variation in shell color has remained stable for years, but the mechanisms responsible are unknown. Previous studies suggest that this stability could be caused by frequency-dependent sexual selection, but this hypothesis has not been tested. We analyzed shell color polymorphism in mating pairs and surrounding unmated individuals in two different populations of L. fabalis to estimate sexual fitness for color, as well as assortative mating. The estimated effective population size from neutral markers allowed us to disregard genetic drift as the main source of color frequency changes across generations. Shell color frequency was significantly correlated with sexual fitness showing a pattern of negative frequency dependent selection with high disassortative mating for color. The results suggested a contribution of male mate choice to maintain the polymorphism. Finally, the implementation of a multi-model inference approach based on information theory allowed us to test for the relative contribution of mate choice and mate competition to explain the maintenance of color polymorphism in this snail species.

SP  - 365-374
AB  - The development of economic thermoelectric generators for waste heat recovery has become an increasing research focus over the past a few years. Traditionally, attempts to improve their economic viability have concentrated primarily on improving the conversion efficiency by increasing the figure-of-merit of thermoelectric materials, with only marginal successes. This paper explores the possibilities and implications of alternative approaches in an attempt to improve the economic competitiveness of thermoelectric generators based on currently available materials (i.e., with ZTsimilar to1). Novel concepts which provide alternative approaches to overcome low efficiency drawback are discussed and examples presented, typical of which include high-power-density thermoelectric generating modules; symbiotic systems for co-generation of heat and power; high efficiency heat-recirculating thermoelectric-combustion systems and thermoelectric microgenerators.

AB  - A standalone alignment technology was developed as a fundamental solution to improve on-product overlay (OPO). It enables high performance alignment measurements, and delivers state-of-the-art feed forward corrections to exposure scanner. Dense alignment sampling and high-order field distortion correction is effective for scanner fingerprint matching and for heat related field distortions. A modeling and sampling optimization software is a powerful tool for dense sampling and high-order overlay correction with minimal throughput loss. We performed an overlay experiment using the standalone alignment technology coupled with a modeling and sampling optimization software, which demonstrates on-product overlay improvement potential for next generation manufacturing accuracy and productivity challenges.

TI  - Ploidy induction and sex control in fish
VL  - 384
SP  - 167-243
AB  - In fish, pre-embryonic events such as insemination, second polar body extrusion and first mitotic cleavage are manipulable and render 37 different types of ploidy induction possible. A classification of physical, chemical, and biological inductors of ploidy is provided. The amazing ability of fish to tolerate genomes from haploid to heptaploid, genomic contributions from the male or female parent alone, and unequal contributions from parents belonging to the same or different species is highlighted: surprisingly, a single species is amenable for 8-12 different types of ploidy induction. Advantages and limitations of different methods and live or preserved tissues for ploidy confirmation are assessed. Live haploids have been induced in Oreochromis mossambicus. With an ability to synthesize rRNAs and metabolic enzymes such as LDH, the haploid embryos are capable of normal translation and transcription, but suffer mass mortality at hatching, perhaps due to expression of lethal mutant genes. Induction of gynogenesis involves egg activation by irradiated homologous or heterologous sperm, and diploidization by retention of the second polar body (meiotic gynogenesis), or suppression of the first mitotic cleavage (mitotic gynogenesis). UV-irradiation inactivates sperm DNA maximally and avoids chromosome fragmentation. Egg activation by UV-irradiated heterologous sperm under dark conditions, and diploidization by pressure shock result in the highest survival of gynogens; meiotic gynogens survive better than mitotic gynogens. The need for confirmation of genetic purity of mitotic gynogens by one or more methods is emphasized. In different species, survival, growth and fertility improve when gynogens are generated successively for two or more generations. Combinations of induction of ploidy and hormonal sex reversal in gynogens renders the scope for generating all-male or all-female populations. In some gynogenetic species genetic homozygosity leads to growth suppression from 3 to 60%; however, meiotic gynogens of Clarias macrocephalus and Paralicthys olivaceus display 18 and 35% faster growth. Hypotheses for the unexpected occurrence of males among natural and artificially induced gynogenetic populations are assessed. In a few species, reproductive performance of gynogens is not equivalent to normal females. Maximal elimination of egg genome by UV-radiation, induction of androgenesis using 2n sperm of a tetraploid, facilitation of dispermy using heterologous eggs, and activation by cryopreserved sperm are land-mark events in the history of androgenesis. In male-heterogametic species, androgenesis may produce supermales to establish broodstock for consistent production of air-male populations. In combination with cryopreservation of sperm, androgenesis may prove to be the best method for conservation of fish genomes. As many as 11 different types of triploids are inducible; and most of them require the retention of the second polar body. The yield and survival of triploids are higher than those of gynogens and these values decrease with the kind of inductor used in the following order: pressure < cold < heat shock. Usually triploidy confers sterility, especially in females, and accelerates growth during post-maturation, when reared solitarily in some (Tinca tinca, Oreochromis Mossambicus) or communally (with diploids) in other species (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The presence of two sets of maternal chromosomes does not disturb the manifestation of morphological sexual characters; however, unexpected sex ratios observed in some triploids indicate a preponderance of females in natural populations and a dominance of males in artificially induced populations. In some species, a certain percentage of female triploids are fertile. possible pathways, through which the natural fertile triploids may form the base for evolution of tetraploids and origin of diploid new species are suggested. Triploids, especially females, suffer delayed maturity, a low gonado-somatic index, and disrupted gametogenesis due to cytogenetic and endocrine incompatibilities; males do not suffer endocrine incompatibility Three possible pathways, through which oogenesis may be completed in these fertile triploid species, are indicated. Triploid hybridization between salmonids, which can tolerate salinity changes (e.g. chum and pink salmons) and which cannot tolerate early transfer to sea water but are desired for their meat quality (e.g. Atlantic, chinook and coho salmons) is commercially important. Triploid conspecific salmonids grow faster than diploid conspecifics or triploid hybrids. Protocols for the combination of induced ploidy and hormonal sex reversal to generate all-male, all-female or all-sterile triploid populations are described. In triploids, the increase in nuclear DNA per cell is 1.3 to 1.7 times that of diploids, which results in corresponding volumetric increase of a cell. This, in rum, imposes corresponding decreases in total cell surface area and cell number of a tissue or a triploid individual; however, such a decrease in cell surface area does not impair metabolic processes like oxygen uptake and food utilization. Data for effective temperature required to induce cold or heat shock to retain the second polar body suggest that an elevation of 18, 15 and 14 degrees C successfully retains the polar body in salmonids, cyprinids and cichlids; the corresponding values for the depression of temperature are 11, 19 and 21 degrees C, respectively. Seven different kinds of tetraploidy are inducible; however, live, feeding tetraploids have been induced in ten species only. Causes for embryonic or post-embryonic mortality of tetraploids are discussed. Increasing maternal genomic contribution and heterologous insemination appear to enhance tetraploid survival. Survival and growth of Oncorhynchus mykiss progressively improve in F-1 and F-2 tetraploid progenies. In a rare strain of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, pentaploids, hexaploids and heptaploids have been successfully induced. An individual polyploid leach (3n) simultaneously spawns small, intermediate and large eggs carrying n, 2n and 3n genomes. It is not clear how during oogenesis the passage of n, 2n and 3n genomes is regulated into small, intermediate and large eggs. However, evidence from other fish species is accumulating for the simultaneous production of at least two kinds of eggs by a single female. Studies on ploidy induction have shown the magnitude of the complicated genetic mechanisms that control sex determination in fish.

TI  - When three traits make a line: evolution of phenotypic plasticity and genetic assimilation through linear reaction norms in stochastic environments
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 486-500
AB  - Genetic assimilation emerges from selection on phenotypic plasticity. Yet, commonly used quantitative genetics models of linear reaction norms considering intercept and slope as traits do not mimic the full process of genetic assimilation. We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead, we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that, respectively, (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually becomes equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs of maintaining plasticity. The asymptotic evolutionary outcome of this three-trait linear reaction norm generally entails a lower degree of phenotypic plasticity than the two-trait model, and maximum expected fitness does not occur at the mean trait values in the population.

TI  - Economic and CO2 avoided emissions analysis of WWTP biogas recovery and its use in a small power plant in Brazil
VL  - 17
SP  - 77-84
AB  - An anaerobic wastewater treatment generates at the end of its process an anaerobic biomass, also known as anaerobic sludge, and a major sub product, the biogas, composed mainly by methane (CH4) and carbonic gas (CO2). The biogas needs to be collected in order to be flared or used in another process, especially because it cannot be released directly into the atmosphere due to methane gas and its high global warming potential. Nevertheless, when this gas is burnt, an energy vector for micro generation is discarded. In the present work was designed a thermal power plant using the biogas produced in an anaerobic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) through an implementation methodology that considers the population growth according to a southeast ordinary Brazilian city. The energy production potential, avoided CO2 emissions due to the biogas burnt and the possibility of using this energy to supply the WWTP's internal demand consumption were analyzed, as well as the project's economic viability and the arising benefits from carbon credits, calculated in three scenarios. The data of calculus were based on the Brazilian sales tariffs obtained from Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency - ANEEL, where: i) T1 = 64.9 [US$/MWh] (average tariff on Brazilian energy auction A-5); ii) T2 = 86.47 [US$/MWh] (average tariff for thermal power plants in the same auction), and iii) the third scenario, in which the energy produced would be consumed by the WWTP's internal demand. The economic viability was only achieved in second and third scenarios, being intensified in the scenario that WWTP's internal demand is supplied using the energy generated in the biogas plant.

AB  - The Eight Hundred and Thirty-Second ACT of the Parliament of the Republic of Ghana entitled: Renewable Energy Act, 2011 has assented to provide for the development, management, utilization, sustainability and adequate supply of renewable energy for generation of heat and power for related matters by the year 2020. With the current load shedding and inadequate energy supply in Ghana, it was essential to examine other options that can be added to the grid installed capacity to ease the burden on Ghanaians. The study examined the solar energy resources in Ghana and how this huge potential can be utilized to grow and modernize the Ghanaian economy in order to decrease the high prevalence of poverty. Access to energy has been proven to directly affect human development, therefore, an option of the diversified local energy mix for electricity production will be the best choice to improve an energy economy that would guarantee a safe and consistent supply of high-quality energy services for all Ghanaian. Evidence from the study shows that Ghana has a good potential for both concentrating and non-concentrating solar technologies. It is estimated that 50-100 MW solar energy potential are still untapped in Ghana which requires an investment of US $100-150 million. Developing and harnessing this renewable energy potential will boost the productivity of businesses, industries, and the transport sector while making a significant contribution to the export earnings of the country.

TI  - Movements, Habitat Use, and Thermal Ecology of an Isolated Population of Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii)
IS  - 4
SP  - 781-790
AB  - Because many species of semi-aquatic turtles have specific habitat requirements and unique life history characteristics, they are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat modification. The federally threatened Bog Turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergil) requires specialized wetland habitats, such as bogs and fens, In the eastern United States and often occurs In Isolated populations. To develop a more a detailed understanding of the habitat use, movement, and thermal biology of Bog Turtles, we radiotracked and monitored the temperatures of I I adult Bog Turtles at an Isolated Piedmont meadow bog In North Carolina from May 2007 to March 2008. We found that turtles used soft, shallow mud habitat in the bog, but moved to a streambed when the bog became dry. While In the bog, turtles were often found within or underneath woody debris. Although most turtles resided exclusively In the southern part of the bog and the stream, two male turtles made substantial over-land movements away from the bog exceeding 130 m. All but one turtle overwintered In a streambed adjacent to the bog. Turtles overwintering within stream habitat were not exposed to temperatures below 0 degrees C, but one turtle that overwintered In the bog did reach below-freezing temperatures. This study suggests that high-quality bog habitat and habitat heterogeneity are critical for populations living In Isolated and dynamic habitats. However, maintenance of corridors between suitable habitats may be necessary for the long-term survival of Bog Turtle populations.

AB  - Techno-economic assessments of systems which integrate biomass gasification with fuel cell modules (molten carbonate or phosphoric acid) for electricity generation are presented. The wood-fired Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell was found to be suitable where high heat/electricity values were required, but had low electrical efficiency. Electrical efficiencies of 13-17% are typical for these systems, as are Break-even Electricity Selling Prices (BESPs) of 10-20 p/kWh and specific investments of around pound 3000-pound 7500/kWe. This technology is unlikely to be considered for further development as an electricity generation system. The wood-fired Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell was found to be quite efficient and suitable for small-scale electricity generation purposes. Electrical efficiencies of 25-28% are typical for these systems, as are Break-even Electricity Selling Prices of 6-12 p/kWh and specific investments of around pound 2000-pound 5000/kWe. This technology could be considered for further development in the future, if the lifetime and capital costs of molten carbonate fuel cells can be improved. The problems in assessing future capital costs makes the economic viability of such systems difficult to determine. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Productivity enhancement of solar still with thermoelectric modules from groundwater to produce potable water: A review
VL  - 11
AB  - Groundwater is recognized as a principal source of water for the drinking, irrigation and many other purposes. Researchers have also used groundwater in the solar distillation to convert it to drinkable water by use of solar energy. Even the researchers used thermoelectric modules with Solar operated devices like flat plate collector, evacuated tubes collector, compound parabolic concentrator etc. Hence, the main aim of the present review paper is to examine different researchers work on groundwater into the solar still with thermoelectric modules. It has been found that the thermoelectric modules with solar still appropriate for potable water generation from the groundwater. Future work of the thermoelectric modules with solar still also added in the review paper. At last, it is concluded that the thermoelectric modules with solar still is a potential application to produce potable water from groundwater along with the generation of electricity.

TI  - Design considerations for high temperature, ceramic heat exchangers
SP  - 487-495
AB  - The recent developments in the energy industry have kindled renewed interest in producing energy (alternative fuels and electricity) more efficiently(1). This has motivated the development of higher temperature cycles and their associated equipment. In this paper we will discuss several design configurations coupled with the inherent properties of preferred ceramic materials to assess the viability and design reliability of ceramic heat exchangers for next generation high temperature beat exchangers. These analyses have been extended to conceptually compare the traditional shell and tube heat exchanger with shell and plate heat exchangers. These analyses include hydrodynamic, heat transfer, mechanical stress and reliability models. It was found that ceramic micro-channel heat exchanger designs proved to have the greatest reliability due to their inherent mechanical properties, minimal thermo-mechanical stresses while improving the performance efficiency in a compact footprint.

VL  - 92
IS  - 4
SP  - 253-259
AB  - Food shortage is a stress factor that commonly affects organisms in nature. Resistance to food shortage or starvation resistance (SR) is a complex quantitative trait with direct implications on fitness. However, surveys of natural genetic variation in SR at different geographic scales are scarce. Here, we have measured. variation in SR in sets of lines derived from nine natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected in western Argentina. Our study shows that within population variation explained a larger proportion of overall phenotypic variance (80%) than among populations (7.2%). We also noticed that an important fraction of variation was sex-specific. Overall females were more resistant to starvation than males; however, the magnitude of the sexual dimorphism (SD) in SR varied among lines and explained a significant fraction of phenotypic variance in all populations. Estimates of cross-sex genetic correlations suggest that the genetic architecture of SR is only partially shared between sexes in the populations examined, thus, facilitating further evolution of the SD.

TI  - Changes in voltinism in a pine moth Dendrolimus spectabilis (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) population: implications of climate change
VL  - 46
IS  - 3
SP  - 319-325
AB  - Climate change induces an alteration in the life cycle of many poikilothermic organisms, resulting in changes in the structure and function of communities. Changes in voltinism in the pine moth Dendrolimus spectabilis (Butler), which is known to be univoltine in South Korea, were studied to elucidate the effects of climate change on their voltinism. The developmental stages of the pine moth were evaluated through field surveys, and the developmental rate was estimated at five different temperatures: 17, 20, 25, 28, and 32A degrees C. Field surveys showed that the moths completed two generations per year, indicating that the phenology of the pine moth in this area had changed from univoltinism to bivoltinism. Laboratory experiments showed that increasing the temperature could induce a change in voltinism in the pine moth population. Generations of the bivoltine population displayed phenotypic plasticity: the fitness of the first generation was greater than that of the second generation with regard to size and fecundity. The difference in fitness between the first and second generations could be due to the influence of factors such as low food quality and heat stress on the second generation. Therefore, changes in thermal conditions due to climate change have offered this species the chance to develop a bivoltine population, but they have also exerted ecological costs, especially for the second generation of the pine moth.

VL  - 51

SP  - 413-422
AB  - Polymorphisms are widely known in allozymes and are often assumed neutral in the context of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. However, several studies revealed that, in some loci and species, selection is strongly acting on allozymes and that temperature seems to be an important selective agent. Therefore, we individually determined the recovery time from chill-coma and heat knock-down time of 542 individuals of P. coridon sampled at four sites. Afterwards, we analyzed patterns of allozyme variations in these butterflies by allozyme electrophoresis of eleven loci to test the enzymes' performance under thermal stress conditions and to investigate the possibility of adaptive genotypic variation in relation to temperature stress resistance traits. We obtained significant differences of reactions to cold and heat shocks between the sexes and between reared and wild-captured individuals, but no significant differences among genotypes were found for most of the investigated allozyme loci. However, the Aar1 locus showed significant differences between different genotypes in chill-coma recovery times (p < 0.001), and marginal differences in heat knock-down times (p = 0.073). Thus, Aat1 might be a target for thermal selection. Consequently, our results revealed no clear influence of temperature on most allozyme loci and the otherwise observed differentiation in P. coridon might be explained by stochasticity, and thus geographic structuring should reflect biogeographic processes.

TI  - Tradeoff between horizontal and vertical modes of transmission in bacterial plasmids
VL  - 52
IS  - 2
SP  - 315-329
AB  - It has been hypothesized that there is a fundamental conflict between horizontal (infectious) and vertical (intergenerational) modes of parasite transmission. Activities of a parasite that increase its rate of infectious transmission are presumed to reduce its host's fitness. This reduction in host fitness impedes vertical transmission of the parasite and causes a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Given this tradeoff, and assuming no multiple infections (no within-host competition among parasites), a simple model predicts that the density of uninfected hosts in the environment should determine the optimum balance between modes of parasite transmission. When susceptible hosts are abundant, selection should favor increased rates of horizontal transfer, even at the expense of reduced vertical transmission. Conversely, when hosts are rare, selection should favor increased vertical transmission even at the expense of lower horizontal transfer. We tested the tradeoff hypothesis and these evolutionary predictions using conjugative plasmids and the bacteria that they infect. Plasmids were allowed to evolve for 500 generations in environments with different densities of susceptible hosts. The plasmid's rate of horizontal transfer by conjugation increased at the expense of host fitness, indicating a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Also, reductions in conjugation rate repeatedly coincided with the loss of a particular plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance gene. However, susceptible host density had no significant effect on the evolution of horizontal versus vertical modes of plasmid transmission. We consider several possible explanations for the failure to observe such an effect.

TI  - Patterns of Genetic Diversity in Rare and Common Orchids Focusing on the Korean Peninsula: Implications for Conservation
VL  - 84
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-25
AB  - To provide basic information for orchid conservation, we surveyed the plant allozyme literature to summarize genetic diversity and structure data for (i) rare orchids native to the Korean Peninsula, and (ii) their congeners irrespective of being common and rare or Korean or not. A total of 68 taxa (32 taxa in Korea and 37 outside Korea; Goodyera repens being included in both datasets) were considered in this study. Overall, rare Korean orchid species had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity than their common congeners and common orchids in general at both population and species levels. However, mean values of G (ST) (or F (ST)) for rare and common orchids (Korean or not) did not differ significantly from each other. We found patterns of both low and high genetic diversity in rare Korean orchids. Many rare orchids harbored a complete lack of allozyme variation or extremely low within-population variation, perhaps due to rarity associated with random genetic drift and/or, for the case of warm-temperate orchids, to founder effects during post-glacial re-colonization. In contrast, high levels of genetic variation were found for a few orchids that have become recently rare (due to over-collection during the past several decades), probably because there have not been sufficient generations for the initial diversity to be substantially eroded. In addition, several orchids occurring in the main mountain system of the Korean Peninsula (the Baekdudaegan), that served as a glacial refugium, maintained moderate to high levels of within-population genetic diversity. Based on our genetic data, conservation priority should be given to rare orchid species. Particularly, urgent measures should be implemented on Jeju Island, a popular vacation spot, because it also a hotspot for threatened orchids with low levels of genetic diversity.

TI  - Differences in induced thermotolerance among populations of Olympia oysters
VL  - 239
AB  - An organism's ability to cope with thermal stress is an important predictor of survival in a changing climate. One way in which organisms may acclimatize to thermal stress in the short-term is through induced thermotolerance, whereby exposure to a sublethal heat shock enables the organism to subsequently survive what might otherwise be a lethal event. Whether induced thermotolerance is related to basal thermotolerance is not well understood for marine organisms. Furthermore, whether populations often differ in their capacity for induced thermotolerance is also unclear. Here, we tested for differences in basal thermotolerance and induced thermotolerance among six populations of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) from three California estuaries. Oysters were raised under common-garden laboratory conditions for a generation and then exposed to two treatments (control or sublethal heat shock) followed by a spectrum of temperatures that bound the upper critical temperature in order to determine LT50 (temperature at which 50% of the population dies). All populations exhibited induced thermotolerance by increasing their LT50 to a similar maximum temperature when extreme thermal stress was preceded by a sublethal heat shock. However, populations differed in their basal thermotolerance and their plasticity in thermotolerance. Populations with the highest basal thermotolerance were least able to modify upper critical temperature, while the population with the lowest basal thermotolerance exhibited the greatest plasticity in the upper critical temperature. Our results highlight that populations with high basal thermotolerance may be most vulnerable to climate warming because they lack the plasticity required to adjust their upper thermal limits.

VL  - 52
SP  - 723-729
AB  - The new developments in cookstove design have been made for better usage of sustainable energy and reducing the worse impact of climate change on environment. A cookstove is a combustion device which liberates lot of heat energy during cooking. In the recent developed design of TEG integrated forced draft biomass cookstove, the liberated waste heat energy is utilized for generation of electricity with the help of a thermoelectric generator. A power of 5W is achieved through the thermoelectric generator. The generated electricity is stored in a Li-ion battery and used further for running a 12Vd.c. fan, lighting a LED light, and charging a mobile phone. The novelty in charging a Li-ion battery is to run a fan for domestic biomass cookstove for cleaner combustion. The fan is also used for cooling one side of TEG through heat sink for improving electrical performance of TEG and thus improving the combustion of the cookstove. This cookstove has been deployed in the rural areas to check its usability, viability, electrical and thermal performance under the umbrella of clean combustion. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reproduction dynamics of planktonic microbial eukaryotes in the open ocean
VL  - 19
IS  - 187
AB  - Understanding the biology of reproduction of an organismal lineage is important for retracing key evolutionary processes, yet gaining detailed insights often poses major challenges. Planktonic Foraminifera are globally distributed marine microbial eukaryotes and important contributors to the global carbon cycle. They cannot routinely be cultured under laboratory conditions across generations, and thus details of their life cycle remain incomplete. The production of flagellated gametes has long been taken as an indication of exclusively sexual reproduction, but recent research suggests the existence of an additional asexual generation in the life cycle. To gain a better understanding of the reproductive biology of planktonic Foraminifera, we applied a dynamic, individual-based modelling approach with parameters based on laboratory and field observations to test if sexual reproduction is sufficient for maintaining viable populations. We show that temporal synchronization and potentially spatial concentration of gamete release seems inevitable for maintenance of the population under sexual reproduction. We hypothesize that sexual reproduction is likely beneficial during the adaptation to new environments, while population sustenance in stable environments can be ensured through asexual reproduction.

TI  - SELECTION ON COPULATION DURATION IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER - PREDICTABILITY OF DIRECT RESPONSE VERSUS UNPREDICTABILITY OF CORRELATED RESPONSE
VL  - 45
IS  - 1
SP  - 69-81
AB  - Estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations for seven reproductive attributes had previously been obtained from parent-offspring regression (Gromko, 1987). Copulation duration was shown to have a heritability of 0.23 and to be genetically correlated with courtship vigor (r(A) = -0.41) and with fertility (r(A) = 0.27). These observations form the basis for the prediction of direct and correlated responses to selection for increased and decreased copulation duration, which are reported here. The direct response corresponded closely to prediction, but the correlated responses did not provide consistent qualitative fit. A hypothesis is proposed to explain this difference in predictability of direct and correlated response to selection. The major postulate is that the different polygenes involved in the direct response to selection for copulation duration have different pleiotropic effects.

VL  - 9
AB  - Being affected by a variety of factors, power-generation structure plays an essential role in a high-quality and sustainable development. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the influence of electricity price on it. First, we provide a microeconomic framework to understand the impact mechanism. We discuss two effects through which price level can affect power generation, and then the power-generation structure. After that, an empirical test is conducted using provincial panel data, and the results of it are robust. We also test the above-mentioned mechanism empirically. There are two main conclusions. First, the electricity price has a positive effect on the share of thermal power in electricity generation. Second, the mechanism test shows that an increase of electricity price can not only improve efficiency of power plants but also propel firms to invest in more renewable energy plants.

TI  - The ghost of temperature past: interactive effects of previous and current thermal conditions on gene expression in Manduca sexta
VL  - 223
IS  - 7
AB  - High temperatures can negatively impact the performance and survival of organisms, particularly ectotherms. While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the development of more accurate thermal performance models.

VL  - 46
SP  - 6644-6649
AB  - In the present work, solar energy utilizations by different solar systems such as solar water treatment, solar water heating, stem generation for the purpose of electricity generation; solar pumps, etc. have been introduced. Out of these, a focused approach for the solar water heating, solar water distillation by utilizing different solar collectors have been extensively reviewed to identify the generalized usability in that field. The collection of different solar collectors have different capabilities towards the absorption of direct and diffused solar radiations based on its materials, geometry, design, etc. and for that a rigorous observations have been made in the present effort. As the Earth has a solar energy rich surfaces so related technology search in other fields such as mechanical devices such as in mechanical devices, pneumatic suspension cars, thermal devices, pneumatic pumps, etc. is a worthwhile approach with the help of the current study. In the present study, solar thermal collectors such as vacuum tube collectors, flat plate collectors, concentrated reflectors, trough collectors, etc. have been recognized in this study. The parabolic concentrator covers the larger area of solar energy and evacuated tubes efficiently hold the available solar energy. And, polygeneration systems presents better options for the multi-disciplinary utilizations of renewable energy resources. Depending on the targeted approach, a dignified discussion and a concise conclusion have been framed with its futuristic recommendations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Virus-derived transgenes expressing hairpin RNA give immunity to Tobacco mosaic virus and Cucumber mosaic virus
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: An effective method for obtaining resistant transgenic plants is to induce RNA silencing by expressing virus-derived dsRNA in plants and this method has been successfully implemented for the generation of different plant lines resistant to many plant viruses. Results: Inverted repeats of the partial Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) movement protein (MP) gene and the partial Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) replication protein (Rep) gene were introduced into the plant expression vector and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out and three transgenic tobacco lines (MP16-17-3, MP16-17-29 and MP16-17-58) immune to TMV infection and three transgenic tobacco lines (Rep15-1-1, Rep15-1-7 and Rep15-1-32) immune to CMV infection were obtained. Virus inoculation assays showed that the resistance of these transgenic plants could inherit and keep stable in T-4 progeny. The low temperature (15 degrees C) did not influence the resistance of transgenic plants. There was no significant correlation between the resistance and the copy number of the transgene. CMV infection could not break the resistance to TMV in the transgenic tobacco plants expressing TMV hairpin MP RNA. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that transgenic tobacco plants expressed partial TMV movement gene and partial CMV replicase gene in the form of an intermolecular intron-hairpin RNA exhibited complete resistance to TMV or CMV infection.

TI  - Energy from planted forest and its residues characterization in Brazil
VL  - 239
AB  - An overview of planted forest and its use for energy generation in Brazil is presented. Historical and current data on planted area, productivity and consumption of planted wood is presented. Planted wood was responsible for 7.8% of primary energy consumed in Brazil during 2016, mainly as charcoal for steel industry. Eucalyptus and pine are the main planted species in Brazil. Favourable climate and soil quality enhance productivity of planted forest in Brazil, reaching 30-36 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) thus representing the world's highest productivity, with better managed forests producing up to 70 m(3) ha(-1). Forest residues reach 20% for eucalyptus and 40% for pine as compared to the amount of wood produced. Residues of a particular eucalyptus planted forest were collected directly on the field, considered for fuel and analyzed determining composition, heat value, ash content and thermogravimetric analysis. It is estimated a yearly generation of 20 x 10(6) t of forest residues and 15 x 10(6) t of wood industry residues. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - RETRACTED: Optimal Scheduling of Hydrothermal System Based on Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (Retracted Article)
AB  - A fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) is presented to determine the optimal operation of hydro thermal power system. In order to solve the shortcoming premature and easily local optimum of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), the fuzzy adaptive criterion is applied for inertia weight based on the evolution speed factor and square deviation of fitness for the swarm, in each iteration process, the inertia weight is dynamically changed using the fuzzy rules to adapt to nonlinear optimization process. The performance of FAPSO is demonstrated on hydro- thermal system comprising 1 thermal unit and 4 hydro plants, the comparison is drawn in PSO, FAPSO and genetic algorithms(GA) in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency. The experiment showed that the proposed approach has higher quality solutions and strong ability in global search.

TI  - FUNDAMENTAL STUDY FOR THE POWER TOWER'S HIGH CONCENTRATED PHOTOVOLTAIC/THERMAL-COMBINED THERMAL RECEIVER
AB  - The present study introduces fundamental aspects of a novel concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) technology.' The technology is based on combining CPV/T receiver along with a solar thermal receiver. The combination is referred to as a High Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal - Combined receiver or HCPV/T-CT. The receiver is allocated in lieu of the conventional solar thermal receivers in the solar tower power plant schemes. The plant is designed to generate electricity and thermal energy simultaneously prior to integration with the conventional water desalination plant. The centralized generation in the CPV/T-CT receiver will remarkably simplify the complexity of the conventional solar power plants, and eliminate the piping networks' energy losses in the CPV/T Dish tracking plants. The viability of the HCPV/T-CT power tower plant has also been investigated by; firstly, designing and simulating the plant performance using the System advisor model (SAM) software, and secondly, designing a prototype receiver and then deriving a mathematical model. The Levelised Cost Of Electricity/Energy (LCOE) was found to be 0.119 $/kWhe and 0.021 $/kWhe for electricity and energy generation, respectively, while the photovoltaic cells temperature maintained below the 90 degrees C.

TI  - A New Method to Efficiently Estimate the Equilibrium State of Pebble Bed Reactors
VL  - 208
IS  - 10
SP  - 1577-1590
AB  - Equilibrium state generation for the pebble bed reactor (PBR) is challenging due to the need to simultaneously account for both pebble movement and changes in fuel compositions. Multigroup diffusion codes have been historically employed to generate the equilibrium state and perform conventional neutronics calculations for PBRs, while neutron cross-section generation has been challenging due to the double heterogeneity of PBRs. Thanks to the capability to treat the double heterogeneity naturally, continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) methods are more suitable for detailed PBR analysis, but at the cost of significantly higher computing power. This paper presents a new Methodology to Efficiently Estimate the Equilibrium State of a PBR (MEEES-PBR) to generate equilibrium-state MC models for PBRs at lower computational expense. The MEEES-PBR is expected to contribute to the future development of PBR designs by accelerating the efforts in core designs and parametric studies. The theory of the MEEES-PBR is introduced in detail in this paper, and the procedure is demonstrated via an example application to the 165-MW(thermal) Xe-100 design. The computational cost and the accuracy of the MEEES-PBR are discussed to prove its viability.

VL  - 9

SP  - 372-382
AB  - The rapid movement of heat transferred goes to be the most important target for researchers to deals with the thermal problems of electronic systems. Especially, that has high packing densities in limited space. Consequently, vertical combination between two shapes of fins was considered to improve the thermal performance of heat sink. Here, many models (longitudinal-pin fins) were created as a new approach based on the stable both of material and size. In the analytical solution, Finite element techniques used to solve the mathematical modeling and signum-sinusoidal-signum function was modified to model both the variable heat transfer area and convection perimeter. While in the numerical procedure, ANSYS simulation used as the validation of temperature distribution. In addition, results from previous work were used as second method of validation process. The results show a high level of agreement by maximum difference does not exceed (3.52%). In the calculation process, natural convection, range of Ra number (105-107) were applied for all models of which each one is distinguished by the parameter of area ratio (A*) between hybrid model and longitudinal model. The results show many advantages; a significant drop in temperature profile about (2.7%-8.8%). Also, decrease in thermal resistance by (23%-43%) and increases in heat transferred (29%-78%). Furthermore, all parameters have a significant improve for the models that have A* < 1.48. But this improvement was down to less level at A* > 1.48 as a result of overlapping between the effects of miscellaneous parameters. Irreversibility that associated with the entropy generation was considered. In this step, it becomes important to find the model that achieves maximize of the thermal performance and minimize of the entropy generation. For that, the optimization procedure using genetic algorithm was adopted. It's clearly the best model exist within a close range between 1.509 and 1.518 based on the behavior of the best fitness function. (C) 2020 Beihang University.

TI  - Urban heat stress: novel survey suggests health and fitness as future avenue for research and adaptation strategies
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
AB  - Extreme heat has tremendous adverse effects on human health. Heat stress is expected to further increase due to urbanization, an aging population, and global warming. Previous research has identified correlations between extreme heat and mortality. However, the underlying physical, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors remain largely unknown and comprehensive quantitative investigation on an individual level is lacking. We conducted a new cross-sectional household questionnaire survey to analyze individual heat impairment (self-assessed and reported symptoms) and a large set of potential risk factors in the city of Berlin, Germany. This unique dataset (n = 474) allows for the investigation of new relationships, especially between health/fitness and urban heat stress. Our analysis found previously undocumented associations, leading us to generate new hypotheses for future research: various health/fitness variables returned the strongest associations with individual heat stress. Our primary hypothesis is that age, the most commonly used risk factor, is outperformed by health/fitness as a dominant risk factor. Related variables seem to more accurately represent humans' cardiovascular capacity to handle elevated temperature. Among them, active travel was associated with reduced heat stress. We observed statistical associations for heat exposure regarding the individual living space but not for the neighborhood environment. Heat stress research should further investigate individual risk factors of heat stress using quantitative methodologies. It should focus more on health and fitness and systematically explore their role in adaptation strategies. The potential of health and fitness to reduce urban heat stress risk means that encouraging active travel could be an effective adaptation strategy. Through reduced CO2 emissions from urban transport, societies could reap double rewards by addressing two root causes of urban heat stress: population health and global warming.

AB  - The heat generated between friction couple during high speed braking induces thermal distortion in the disc and leads to appearance of hot spots. The nature and extent of intensity of this phenomenon are highly influenced by the mechanical and thermal properties of materials. In the present work, three non-asbestos organic (NAO) friction composites with three metallic particulate fillers (iron, copper and brass) were developed. They were evaluated on a specially designed tribometer for enabling the studies of hot spots and thermal localization phenomenon under braking conditions. Overall, composite with iron powder proved best by showing least tendency for hot-spot generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of Cold and Heat Tolerance of Bactrocera tau (Walker)
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
AB  - Simple Summary Insects are often stressed by adverse factors in their natural environment. Temperature is a crucial driver of insect activity, adaptability, and distribution, and therefore, it greatly impacts the invasive success of alien pests. Bactrocera tau (Walker) is an invasive polyphagous herbivore of vegetables and fruits, now a pest of global importance. This study provides useful information about B. tau's cold- and heat tolerance to extremely low and high temperatures. Its different life stages (i.e., egg, larvae, pupae, and adult) had high survival rates under adverse temperatures spanning -5 to 0 degrees C and 39 to 42 degrees C. These findings suggest that B. tau possesses a wide temperature threshold range for survival, which likely contributes to its better establishment and expansion in new regions. Meanwhile, fitted curves were used to quantify B. tau's tolerance potential as a function of both stress intensity (heat or cold) and exposure duration. The information generated in this study will contribute to our understanding of thermal tolerance in B. tau and could also provide insights for devising phytosanitary control approaches. Bactrocera tau (Walker) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a serious, economically important invasive pest that has spread and been established in many regions worldwide. Temperature is a crucial abiotic factor governing insect activity, fitness, and geographical distribution. Yet, surprisingly, the tolerance of B. tau to extreme cold and heat stress remains unclear. Here, we measured the supercooling point (SCP) of different life stages of B. tau. Further, several life stages of B. tau (egg, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar larvae, 1-day-old pupae, and 3-day-old adult) were subjected to six low temperatures (-9, -7, -5, -3, -1, and 0 degrees C) and six high temperatures (39, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44 degrees C) for various durations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h), and three-way survival-time-temperature relationships were investigated. We found that the SCPs differed significantly among different life stages of B. tau, being the lowest for SCP of eggs, at -25.82 +/- 0.51 degrees C. There was no significant effect of sex on the mean SCPs of B. tau adults, except for 45- to 50-day-old flies. In addition, an interaction effect was uncovered between tested temperatures and exposure duration upon B. tau mortality at different life stages. Eggs exhibited the strongest cold tolerance, yet the weakest heat tolerance. The 3rd instar larvae were the most heat- and cold tolerant among larval stages, followed by the 2nd and 1st instar larvae. The upper limit of the chill injury zone (ULCIZ) for 3-day-old adult and 1-day-old pupae was -2.51 degrees C and -2.50 degrees C, respectively, while their corresponding lower limit of thermal injury zone (LLTIZ) was 39.39 degrees C and 38.29 degrees C. This paper presents valuable data to provide an integrated knowledge for understanding the cold and heat tolerance potential of B. tau and ensure the proper implementation of post-harvest phytosanitary protocols for this pest's disinfestation.

TI  - The level of adaptability of perspective samples of soft and durum spring wheat in Ukrainian forest-steppe
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SP  - 12-22
AB  - In the Eastern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine, which is characterized by a sharp change in weather conditions during the growing season of agricultural crops, it is very important to grow hybrids that are most adapted to frequent weather anomalies during the growing season. This can significantly reduce their negative impact on the productivity of spring wheat. The results of a study of 20 samples (soft spring wheat Triticum aestivum L.) and (durum spring wheat Trticum durum) of different ecological and geographical origin for adaptability when changing environmental conditions (Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Sweden) are presented. Adaptability indicators were determined by the following characteristics: mass of one spike, mass of grain from one spike, number of grains from one spike, mass of 1000 seeds, mass of grain from 1 m2. Samples that have high plasticity and stability by these characteristics have been identified. 3As a result of the conducted studies, the dependence between the main signs of productivity were established: the number of grains from one spike, the mass of grains from one spike, the mass of 1000 seeds, the mass of one spike, the mass of seeds from 1 m2 of Triticum aestium and Triticum durumsamples. We have considered the adaptability of selection characteristics of samples by years with different environmental conditions: air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation amount, and hydrothermal coefficient.

TI  - The effect of three environmental conditions on the fitness of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-mediated permethrin resistance in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: The evolution of insecticide resistance and persistence of resistance phenotypes are influenced by the fitness of resistance alleles in the absence of insecticide pressure. Experimental determination of fitness is difficult, but fitness can be inferred by measuring changes in allele frequencies in appropriate environments. We conducted allele competition experiments by crossing two highly related strains of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. One strain (ISOP450) was permethrin resistant (due to P450-mediated detoxification) and one was a susceptible strain. Allele and genotype frequencies were examined for 12 generations under three environmental conditions: standard laboratory, temephos exposure (an insecticide to which the P450 detoxification mechanism in ISOP450 confers no resistance and which is commonly used in mosquito control programs) and cold temperature stress (mimics the colder temperatures within the habitat of this mosquito). Results: A fitness cost was inferred for the P450 mechanism in the standard laboratory environment. A greater cost was associated with the temephos exposed environment, suggesting the temephos placed an additional stress on the P450 resistant mosquitoes. No observed cost was associated with the P450 resistance locus in the cold temperature environment, but there was a significant heterozygote advantage. In all environments the fitness of the resistant homozygotes was the lowest. Conclusion: The cytochrome P450-mediated permethrin detoxification resistance in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus can have an associated fitness cost in the absence of permethrin, relative to a susceptible allele. The strength of the cost varies depending on the environmental conditions. P450-mediated resistance is expected to decrease over time if the permethrin application is relaxed and to decrease at an even faster rate if permethrin is replaced with temephos. Additionally, these results indicate that a P450 resistance allele can persist (especially in heterozygotes) in colder temperatures and could potentially be carried into the Culex pipiens hybrid zone.

AB  - High-nickel layered oxide cathodes with a Ni content of >90% show substantial potential for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high capacity and lower cost. However, they are plagued by rapid capacity decay and poor thermal stability, which hamper their practical viability. We present here Li0.98Mg0.02Ni0.94Co0.06O2 (NC-Mg) with 2% Mg doping, aiming to provide a strategic guideline for solving the issues. The Mg2+ ions occupy the lithium layer and are proposed to act as pillar ions, which substantially enhance the structural reversibility and reduce the anisotropic lattice distortion upon cycling, thereby greatly improving the electrochemical and thermal stability of NC-Mg compared to the undoped LiNi0.94Co0.06O2 (NC). Specifically, NC-Mg delivers 214 mA h g(-1) with a capacity retention of 80.1% after 500 cycles in pouch-type full cells, much higher than the retention of NC (56.3%). A discharge capacity of 158 mA h g(-1) at 10C rate demonstrates its remarkable rate capability. Additionally, the Mg doping significantly elevates the exothermic peak temperature of NC-Mg to 211 degrees C, in sharp contrast to 177 degrees C for NC, highlighting the improved thermal stability of NC-Mg. Collectively, the superior performance of NC-Mg demonstrates a feasible alternative strategy for developing safer, high-energy-density LIBs.

TI  - Biological characteristics of Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) for three consecutive generations under different temperatures: understanding the possible impact of global warming on a soybean pest
VL  - 102
IS  - 3
SP  - 285-292
AB  - Climate changes can affect the distribution and intensity of insect infestations through direct effects on their life cycles. Experiments were carried out during three consecutive generations to evaluate the effect of different temperatures (25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C, 34 degrees C and 37+/-1 degrees C) on biological traits of the velvetbean caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, 1818 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The insects were fed on artificial diet and reared in environmental chambers set at 14h photophase. The developmental cycle slowed with the increase in the temperature, within the 25 degrees C to 34 degrees C range. Male and female longevities were reduced with an increase in temperature from 25 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Egg viability was highest at 25 degrees C, and the sex ratio was not influenced by temperature, in the three generations. There was no interactive effect between development time and temperature on pupal weight. The results suggested that the increase in the temperature negatively impacted A. gemmatalis development inside the studied temperature range, indicating a possible future reduction of its occurrence on soybean crops, as a consequence of global warming, mainly considering its impact on tropical countries where this plant is cropped. A. gemmatalis was not able to adapt to higher temperatures in a three-generation interval for the studied temperature range. However, a gradual increase and a longer adaptation period may favor insect selection and consequently adaptation, and must be considered in future studies in this area. Moreover, it is important to consider that global warming might turn cold areas more suitable to A. gemmatalis outbreaks. Therefore, more than a future reduction of A. gemmatalis occurrence due to global warming, we might expect changes regarding its area of occurrence on a global perspective.

VL  - 60
SP  - 188-195
AB  - The present paper reports the results obtained on a carbon dioxide transcritical power cycle using an energy and exergy analysis. The procedure consisted of modifying the inlet pressure to the turbine from 66 bar, by means of the software HYSYS (R), maintaining constant each evaluated turbine inlet temperature (60, 90, 120 and 150 degrees C) until the net work was approximately zero. As a result, an increase up to 25% for the exergy efficiency, and up to 300% for the energy efficiency are obtained when the inlet temperature to the turbine is risen from 60 to 150 degrees C. Consequently, the analysis shows the viability of implementing this process as alternative energy, because of the possibility to recovery energy from waste heat from industrial processes.

TI  - Analysis of a solar dish-Stirling system with hybridization and thermal storage
VL  - 5
IS  - 2
AB  - A high potential of thermosolar power generation systems is the use of thermal storage and/or hybridization to overcome dependability of solar resource availability. The incorporation of these technologies can be of special interest for isolated units intended for distributed generation systems. Among the thermosolar systems, dishStirling technology is the one with more possibilities to be used as a system to feed power independently, i. e., due to the modularity of the units that range between 3 and 25 kWe, depending on the supplier. Thus, the present analysis is focused on studying integration of both hybridization and thermal storage in an isolated unit of 10 kWe dish-Stirling. In particular, hybridization will enable a more continuous operation of the system. Hybridization is analyzed both for a conventional fuel, such as natural gas, and for a renewable energy source, biogas. Analysis of performance of the dish-Stirling system enables to determine the interest of introducing the complementary technologies referred above. Regarding the specific case evaluated in this paper, analyzed data show that hybridization has an advantage that depends on the nature of fuel used, being of 20 % for natural gas and 112 % for biogas in relation to output power of solar-only operation. Thermal energy storage system shows no significant benefits when implemented to a variable power system.

TI  - Does gene flow aggravate or alleviate maladaptation to environmental stress in small populations?
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
SP  - 1402-1416
AB  - Environmental change can expose populations to unfamiliar stressors, and maladaptive responses to those stressors may result in population declines or extirpation. Although gene flow is classically viewed as a cause of maladaptation, small and isolated populations experiencing high levels of drift and little gene flow may be constrained in their evolutionary response to environmental change. We provide a case study using the model Trinidadian guppy system that illustrates the importance of considering gene flow and genetic drift when predicting (mal)adaptive response to acute stress. We compared population genomic patterns and acute stress responses of inbred guppy populations from headwater streams either with or without a recent history of gene flow from a more diverse mainstem population. Compared to "no-gene flow" analogues, we found that populations with recent gene flow showed higher genomic variation and increased stress tolerance-but only when exposed to a stress familiar to the mainstem population (heat shock). All headwater populations showed similar responses to a familiar stress in headwater environments (starvation) regardless of gene flow history, whereas exposure to an entirely unfamiliar stress (copper sulfate) showed population-level variation unrelated to environment or recent evolutionary history. Our results suggest that (mal)adaptive responses to acutely stressful environments are determined in part by recent evolutionary history and in part by previous exposure. In some cases, gene flow may provide the variation needed to persist, and eventually adapt, in the face of novel stress.

VL  - 13

AB  - Laser-induced fluorescence is recently used as an efficient technique in cancer diagnosis and non-invasive treatment. Here, the synergic therapeutical efficacies of the Capecitabine (CAP) chemodrug, photosensitive Phycocyanin (PC) and graphene oxide (GO) under laser irradiation were investigated. The therapeutical efficacies of diverse concentrations of CAP (0.001-10 mg/ml) and PC (0.5-10 mg/ml) alone and with laser irradiation on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were examined. The interactional effects of 100 mW SHG Nd:YAG laser at 532nm and GaAs laser at 808 nm ranging power of 150 mW- 2.2W were considered. The contribution of graphene oxide (GO) in biocompatible concentrations of 2.5-20 ng/ml and thermal characteristics of laser exposure at 808 nm on GO + fluorophores have been studied. The effects of the bare and laser-excited CAP + PC on cell mortality have been obtained. Despite the laser irradiation could not hold up the cell proliferation in the absence of drug interaction considerably; however, the viability of the treated cells (by a combination of fluorophores) under laser exposure at 808 nm was significantly reduced. The laser at 532 nm excited the fluorescent PC in (CAP + PC) to trigger the photodynamic processes via oxygen generation. Through the in-vitro experiments of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy of PC + CAP, the PC/CAP concentrations of the maximum fluorescence signal and spectral shifts have been characterized. The synergic effects of the laser exposures and (CAP + PC) treatment at different concentrations were confirmed. It has been shown here that the laser activation of (CAP + PC) can induce the mortality of the malignant cells by reducing the chemotherapeutic dose of CAP to avoid its non-desirable side effects and by approaching the minimally invasive treatment. Elevation of the laser intensity/exposure time could contribute to the therapeutic efficacy. Survival of the treated cells with a combination of GO and fluorophores could be reduced under laser exposure at 808 nm compared to the same combination therapy in the absence of GO. This survey could benefit the forthcoming clinical protocols based on laser spectroscopy for in-situ imaging/diagnosis/treatment of adenocarcinoma utilizing PC + CAP + GO.

VL  - 23

SP  - 203-210
AB  - Anagrus nilaparvatae is the dominant egg parasitoid of rice planthoppers and plays an important role in biological control. Symbiotic bacteria can significantly influence the development, survival, reproduction and population differentiation of their hosts. To study the influence of temperature on symbiotic bacterial composition in the successive generations of A. nilaparvatae, A. nilaparvatae were raised under different constant temperatures of 22 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to investigate the diversity of symbiotic bacteria. Our results revealed that the endophytic bacteria of A. nilaparvatae were Pantoea sp., Pseudomonas sp. and some uncultured bacteria. The bacterial community composition in A. nilaparvatae significantly varied among different temperatures and generations, which might be partially caused by temperature, feeding behavior and the physical changes of hosts. However, the analysis of wsp gene showed that the Wolbachia in A. nilaparvatae belonged to group A, sub-group Mors and sub-group Dro. Sub-group Mors was absolutely dominant, and this Wolbachia composition remained stable in different temperatures and generations, except for the 3rd generation under 34 degrees C during which sub-group Dro became the dominant Wolbachia. The above results suggest that the continuous high temperature of 34 degrees C can influence the Wolbachia community composition in A. nilaparvatae.

VL  - 17
IS  - 2
SP  - 399-405
AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a new biomaterial which has wide application potential in various industries. BC industrialization requires bacterial strains with high BC productivity. The objective of this study is to increase the BC yield of a Gluconoacetobacter xylinus strain through mutagenesis induced by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment. In this study, the parental strain in its exponential phase was treated at 250 MPa and 25 degrees C for 15 min to induce mutagenesis using a HHP machine. The HHP-treated strains were incubated in glucose agar plate at 30 degrees C for 4 days. After the incubation, 50 larger colonies in these plates were randomly selected and cultivated to produce BC membrane in a tailor-made glass vessel, and wet weights of the BC membranes were tested. Compared with the parental strain, 29 mutants showed higher BC yields, of which eight mutants with BC yield >130.00 g/L were initially screened and were then cultivated for five generations to test their genetic stabilities for BC production. Among the eight mutants, M-438, a mutant which showed the highest average BC yield (158.56 g/L) and lowest coefficient of variation (2.4%) for five generations, was finally screened as objective mutant. HHP treatment can serve as an effective method to cause mutagenesis in BC-producing bacteria. The HHP-treated strains with significantly higher BC yield than parental strain can be screened from the HHP-induced mutants.

AB  - This paper presents load frequency control (LFC) of interconnected power systems involving multi-source power generation. The investigations are carried on a typical two area power system comprising hydro, thermal, and gas power generations with speed governors in each area. A discrete time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) load frequency control is applied only to thermal and gas power generating units and hydro is allowed to operate at its scheduled generation level with only speed governor control. The transient performance of the two area power system is investigated for different combinations of generations from thermal and gas sources with different scheduled operating load conditions when subjected to step load disturbance of 1% in area-1. The PID controller gains are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) for a sampling period of two seconds. The combination of integral squared error (ISE) and integral time an absolute error (ITAE) performance index is used for fitness evaluation.

TI  - Overview of electric power potential of surplus agricultural biomass from economic, social, environmental and technical perspective-A case study of Punjab
VL  - 42
SP  - 286-297
AB  - Biomass is a renewable, economic and readily available resource of energy that has potential to substitute fossil fuels in many applications such as heat, electricity and biofuels. The increased use of the agricultural biomass can help the agricultural based societies in achieving energy security and creating employment without causing envitonmental degradation. But, the viability and feasibility of electricity generation from agricultural biomass depends upon the availability of biomass supply at a competitive cost. The present study investigates the availability of agricultural biomass for distributed power generation in Punjab. The total production of the crop residues has been estimated by residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Further, the restrictions introduced by competitive uses as well as harvesting practices are taken into considerations to evaluate the available biomass potential. The biomass power potential has been obtained on considerations of energy contents of the particular crop residues and selecting appropriate conversion route. A total of 55.396 Mt of the agricultural residues are produced from various major crops. Out of these, 22315 Mt (40.17%) of the agricultural biomass has been found to be surplus with an average density of 443 t/km(2). These surplus residues can significantly be used to provide continuous, reliable and sustainable fuel supply for power plants. Cereals (rice, wheat, maize and barley) have major contribution (74.67%) in the surplus biomass, followed by cotton (25.01%) and sugarcane (0.2%). The estimated annual bio-energy potential of unused crop residues is 0.35 EJ (8.43% of India's potential), which is equivalent to 1.43% India's annual primary energy consumption. It has been revealed that a power potential of 2000-3000 MW can be exploited from these resources depending upon thermal efficiency. The study concludes with a discussion on significance and challenges of decentralized electricity generation for rural energy supply, including brief description about economical, social, environmental and technical aspects of bioelectricity.

AB  - Biomass energy has yet to be fully developed due to the major barriers. These include a lack of knowledge concerning biomass resources and economic obstacles associated with transportation and storage. This study examines the viability of harnessing solid waste and food waste for power generation on the STES Campus in Lonavala, Maharashtra, India. The performance of biomass gasification technology is evaluated to understand its ability to reduce CO2 emissions associated with electricity generation. This study clarifies the various methods of harnessing energy from biomass resources. With the available resources on the Campus, it is estimated that 40kWH of energy can be produced per day. The technology is a promising way to reduced local CO2 emissions which degrade air quality and contribute to global warming.

VL  - 62

SP  - 157-173
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is widely considered as the most serious insect defoliator of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.). The CPB can completely destroy potato crops and cause tremendous yield losses if left uncontrolled. For decades, CPB populations have been suppressed mainly by chemical insecticides. However, this insect's diverse and flexible life history, combined with its remarkable adaptability to a variety of stressors, makes the CPB a very challenging pest to control. Potato foliage, which contains high amounts of volatile and non-volatile chemicals, is the CPB's main food source. Researchers indicated that variations in the feeding performance and abundance of this beetle are attributable to the quality and quantity of chemical components in the host plant foliage. This review investigated the effects of volatile chemicals, carbohydrates, amino acids, glycoallcaloids, and mineral elements in potato foliage on the feeding behaviour and performance of the CPB. In general, the chemical components in potato foliage could enhance or reduce the feeding of the CPB. Altering the chemical composition of potato foliage could be an interesting alternative to reduce the use of insecticides to manage CPB populations in potato crops.

SP  - 331-346
AB  - Braking systems are one of the most important vehicle components. The kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted to heat energy by friction between the brake lining and the rotating brake disc. Brake discs work under very difficult thermo-mechanical conditions due to high temperature and wear. As most commercial discs have high rate and low braking performance, there is a need for development and manufacturing of new discs-brake linings to reduce wear and to increase braking performance. In this study, a sample cast iron discs with ventilation channels, coated with NiCrBSi powder by the thermal spraying and melting method were investigated. The braking performance of disc and the sample coated discs was tested according to SAE J2430 test standards. It was found out that the NiCrBSi coated disc exhibited a lower wear rate and a higher friction coefficient than the original disc. As a result, the NiCrBSi coated disc could be better alternative for new generation brake discs in vehicles than the original one.

TI  - Combined Infrared Imaging and Structure from Motion Approach for Building Thermal Energy Efficiency and Damage Assessment
VL  - 11381
AB  - In the United States, buildings' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 40% of the global energy consumption, and contribute between 40% and 48% of the CO2 emissions. One of the largest causes for this type of energy consumption is heat loss. Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed. IR images of a building are recorded and are used for reconstructing a digital model of the structure. The goal is to characterize the viability of SfM in detecting sub-surface defects that can yield to significant heat loss and reduce thermal efficiency in the facade of the building.

TI  - Behavioral Thermoregulation and Trade-Offs in Juvenile Lobster Homarus americanus
VL  - 230
IS  - 1
SP  - 35-50
AB  - Water temperature influences the behavior and distribution patterns of both larval and adult American lobster Homarus americanus. However, very little is known about the responses of juvenile lobsters. The juvenile life stage is a critical period; high levels of mortality, combined with specific behavioral responses, can disconnect larval settlement from patterns of abundance of adults. We assessed behavioral thermoregulation in juvenile lobsters, and determined how thermal preferences can be altered by the presence of shelter and food. Juvenile lobsters avoided temperatures higher than 20 degrees C and lower than 8 degrees C, and had a mean temperature preference of 16.2 +/- 1 degrees C. This preference was unaffected by prior acclimation, origin (laboratory- raised or wild), or size. When the animals were subjected to a temperature change (5-20 degrees C), activity rates peaked at 15 degrees C, and remained stable thereafter. Activity rates did not change when a shelter was added. The addition of food resulted in an increase in activity associated with food handling. When juvenile lobsters were offered a choice between temperature, shelter, and food, they always chose the environment with a shelter, even when it was in a thermally unfavorable temperature. Juveniles also spent more time in a thermally unfavorable environment when food was present; however, acquisition of a shelter was prioritized over food. Although juveniles had a similar thermal preference to adults, they are more vulnerable to predation; the innate shelter-seeking behavior of juveniles overrode their thermal preference. While temperature is an important environmental factor affecting the physiology, distribution, and growth of aquatic ectotherms, our findings suggest that trade-off behaviors occur in order to maintain optimal fitness and survival of the individual.

AB  - The concept of heat-driven self-cooling of devices is an important energy saving measure by which devices would be able to provide power to run cooling flow without external power supply. Thermoelectric generation device is proposed to convert the heat energy into electrical energy to drive a hydraulic pump of microchannel heat sink based single phase cooling system. The system could be made self-sustaining in terms of power requirement. In this paper, numerical modeling and validation have been conducted based on an experimental study of net power generation in liquid flow based microchannel heat sink. The relationship between coolant flow rate and heat flux at heat source device has been modeled to study the viability of self-cooling concept. It has been found out that at an optimum flow rate of cooling fluid, it is possible to keep the temperature of a heat source device at a required temperature while providing power to run the coolant through the microchannel heat sink.

VL  - 58

AB  - The main objective of this study was to determine the adaptability and sludge reduction potential of the tubificid worm Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri for different conditions of aeration, temperature and worm density, as well as to determine and characterize the development and population dynamics of the worms during sequential sludge predations. A number of short-and long-term experiments were conducted using waste sludge as the support material. The results demonstrated that improper aeration, temperature and worm density can remarkably affect worm growth and sludge reduction. Adult worms were more susceptible to variable environmental conditions. Continuous individual growth and development of the worms were observed under optimal process conditions: intermittent aeration with light intensity, a water temperature of 25 degrees C and an initial worm density in the range of 11-12 g/L. As calculated in a stage-structured population model, the asymptotic population growth rate of the worms was approximately 1 during a period of 117 days, which indicates a stable population size in the sludge predation system. The worm population exhibited a total sludge reduction rate of 297.0 +/- 10.1 mg-TSS/L/d. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 60

SP  - 293-306
AB  - Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann (Heteroptera, Coreidae) is a harmful insect to cones and seeds of several conifers in North America, and was accidentally introduced into Europe where it rapidly spread to many countries. In Central Italy, the pest damaged cones and seeds of Pinus pinea L., leading to a severe reduction of pine nut production. Gryon pennsylvanicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) is the most common egg-parasitoid of L. occidentalis in British Columbia. This natural enemy has been successfully reared under laboratory conditions. However, the possibility to arrange a sufficient large number of specimens is crucial for the success in biological control. In the present work, stored L. occidentalis eggs at fridge and freezing temperatures of +4, -20 A degrees C, and ultra-low temperatures of -80 and -140 A degrees C for different times up to one year, were tested for parasitization success. Results showed that G. pensylvanicum can exploit successfully host eggs stored for long time when stored at ultra-low temperatures and that storage did not affect fitness of the first and second generation. For shorter periods of time, the use of +4 A degrees C for store eggs did not vary significantly from eggs stored at ultra-low temperatures.

VL  - 75
IS  - 6
SP  - 1539-1545
AB  - BACKGROUND Insecticide resistance arises at a given location in response to selection acting on novel genotypes or standing variation, or allelic migration. Fitness costs of resistance may slow resistance evolution or result in reversion to susceptibility, but consistent and geographically widespread use of insecticides may provide sufficient selection to offset the fitness costs of resistance. Understanding this relationship is important to the success of insecticide resistance management. We report the existence of fitness costs of neonicotinoid resistance in field-collected populations of the tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca), which increasingly challenge upland cotton production in the southeastern USA. RESULTS Populations (14 of 15 in 2015; 4 of 5 in 2016) investigated showed a loss of resistance to imidacloprid after multiple generations without exposure to the insecticide. Populations studied in 2016 were each split into two colonies, and one of each pair was repeatedly exposed to imidacloprid. In three of the four populations that lost resistance, imidacloprid-exposed colonies lost resistance significantly more slowly than did corresponding unexposed colonies. CONCLUSION For imidacloprid resistance to be broadly increasing in the landscapes of the southeastern USA despite fitness costs of resistance, selection for resistance must be sufficient to overcome the costs. Findings encourage investigation into why costs are overcome in this system, potentially including geographic extent of neonicotinoid use or prevalence of low-dose exposure.

AB  - This review describes the history and use of heat in the management of a wide range of agricultural and structural pests. Definitions and concepts used in heat treatments are discussed as well as possible mechanisms of thermal lethality. Factors used in determining treatments are availability, costs, complexity, and other constraints. Heat can be used separately in multiple forms or in combination: fire, water-based and atmospheric, steam, vapor heat, dry heat, forced hot air, high temperature controlled atmospheres, electric fields, and electromagnetic energies. The early research into each of these strategies is presented, including design, temperature ranges, and target pests. An understanding of the development of thermal treatments will increase efficacy of pest control and adaptability, and will reduce duplication.

TI  - Dynamics of radiative Williamson hybrid nanofluid with entropy generation: significance in solar aircraft
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Sun based energy is the chief source of heat from the sun, and it utilizes in photovoltaic cells, sun-based power plates, photovoltaic lights and sun-based hybrid nanofluids. Specialists are currently exploring the utilization of nanotechnology and sun-based radiation to further develop flight effectiveness. In this analysis, a hybrid nanofluid is moving over an expandable sheet. Analysts are presently exploring the utilization of nanotechnology and sunlight-based radiation to further develop avionics productivity. To explore the heat transfer rate phenomenon, a hybrid nanofluid stream is moving towards a trough having a parabolic type shape and is located inside of solar airplane wings. The expression used to depict the heat transfer phenomenon was sun based thermal radiation. Heat transfer proficiency of airplane wings is evaluated with the inclusion of distinguished effects like viscous dissipation, slanted magnetic field and solar-based thermal radiations. The Williamson hybrid nanofluid past an expandable sheet was read up for entropy generation. The energy and momentum expressions were solved numerically with the utilization of the Keller box approach. The nano solid particles, which are comprised of copper (Cu) and Graphene oxide, are dispersed utilizing SA (Sodium alginate) as an ordinary liquid (GO). A huge number of control factors, for example, temperature, shear stress, velocity, frictional element along with Nusselt number are investigated in detail. Intensification of thermal conduction, viscous dissipation and radiation improve the performance of airplane wings subjected to heat transmission. Hybrid nanofluid performance is much better than the ordinary nanofluid when it comes to heat transmission analysis.

AB  - Weight reduction is increasingly being considered very important in light of air pollution and the exhaustion of resources. As a result, many automotive components are being replaced by Al and Mg alloys, and studies are increasingly focusing on the same. However, the use of Mg alloys is limited because they have higher material cost and lower productivity owing to the difficult forming conditions compared with Al alloys. In this study, the tube extrusion process conditions of an automotive bumper back beam were analyzed using FEA. Material tests were performed to determine the properties, and experiments and analyses for a simple shape were performed to define the data for heat generation during plastic deformation. Then, the analyses of the product were carried out by considering various temperatures and ram speeds. The conditions were then established, and a product without surface defects was extruded successfully.

VL  - 42

SP  - 110-118
AB  - Obliquebanded leafroller (OBLR), Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is widely distributed in North America where it causes damage to several fruit and nut crops. Macrocentrus iridescens (French) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitizes OBLR in California pistachio orchards, but to date there is little published information on its biology or effectiveness. To determine its potential as a biological control agent, development of M. iridescens was evaluated at eight constant temperatures, ranging from 12.6 to 36.8 degrees C. Results show development times, from egg to adult eclosion, ranged from 115.8 to 36.5 days at 13.9 and 31.0 degrees C, respectively, the lowest and highest temperatures tested that permitted complete development. Fitting the data to a nonlinear model provided estimates of M. iridescens lower (9.8 degrees C), upper (34.3 degrees C), and optimal (23.7 degrees C) development temperatures. M. iridescens requires 625 degree-days to develop from egg to adult stage. To complement laboratory studies, OBLR and M. iridescens season-long field population dynamics were monitored in pistachio orchards, including overwintering behaviors. M. iridescens overwinters in the OBLR larva and produces one generation for each generation of the host. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A model to determine soiling, shading and thermal losses from PV yield data
VL  - 6
IS  - 2
SP  - 1137-1156
AB  - Soiling, shading, and thermal losses were calculated for a 30-kWp PV plant using measured performance data combined with measured transmittance loss of glass coupons installed near the plant. Soiling and shading losses in the month of December were as high as 25.7% and 9.7%, respectively. Apart from being a clean source of energy, photovoltaic (PV) power plants are also a source of income generation for its investors and lenders. Therefore, mitigation of system losses is crucial for economic operation of PV plants. Combined losses due to soiling, shading and temperature in PV plants go as high as 50%. Much of these losses are unaccounted initially, which can jeopardize the economic viability of PV projects. This paper aims to provide a model to determine losses due to soiling, shading and temperature using quantities like irradiance, cell temperature, DC power and current, which are readily available in PV yield data captured by the remote monitoring system, without involving any additional sensors or equipment. In this study, soiling, shading and thermal losses were calculated using PV yield data obtained from a 30-kWp PV plant located in Kharagpur, India. The results showed soiling and shading losses as high as 25.7% and 9.7%, respectively, in the month of December. Soiling loss was verified by measuring transmittance loss of coupon glasses installed in the vicinity of the plant. Shading loss was verified by shadow simulation using an architectural tool (SketchUp). Array thermal loss obtained using the proposed methodology was found to be in line with the estimated value obtained from PVsyst simulation. Additionally, using time-series data, the energy losses corresponding to soiling, shading and temperature effects were calculated by a numerical-integration technique. The monetary loss due to these energy losses thus obtained provides criteria for deciding when to mitigate the sources of these losses.

TI  - Sr1-xCaxFe1-yCoyO3-delta as facile and tunable oxygen sorbents for chemical looping air separation
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Chemical looping air separation (CLAS) is a promising technology for oxygen generation with high efficiency. The key challenge for CLAS is to design robust oxygen sorbents with suitable redox properties and fast redox kinetics. In this work, perovskite-structured Sr1-xCaxFe1-yCoyO3 oxygen sorbents were investigated and demonstrated for oxygen production with tunable redox properties, high redox rate, and excellent thermal/steam stability. Cobalt doping at B site was found to be highly effective, 33% improvement in oxygen productivity was observed at 500 degrees C. Moreover, it stabilizes the perovskite structure and prevents phase segregation under pressure swing conditions in the presence of steam. Scalable synthesis of Sr0.8Ca0.2Fe0.4Co0.6O3 oxygen sorbents was carried out through solid state reaction, co-precipitation, and sol-gel methods. Both co-precipitation and sol-gel methods are capable of producing Sr0.8Ca0.2Fe0.4Co0.6O3 sorbents with satisfactory phase purity, high oxygen capacity, and fast redox kinetics. Large scale evaluation of Sr0.8Ca0.2 Fe0.4Co0.6O3, using an automated CLAS testbed with over 300 g sorbent loading, further demonstrated the effectiveness of the oxygen sorbent to produce 95% pure O-2 with a satisfactory productivity of 0.04 g(O2) g(sorbent)(-1) h(-1) at 600 degrees C.

AB  - India has incorporated renewable energy sources like solar and wind in its energy mix in order to achieve its ambitious plan to set up 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022 to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Among the solar technologies for power generation, solar photovoltaic (SPV) is considered and large SPV parks are deployed around the country. Some of the drawbacks of deploying large-scale SPV parks are discussed in the manuscript. Because of the intermittency of SPV and wind, there is a backup resource of fossil fuel fired thermal plants that are ramped up or down to meet the electricity demand in the grid, especially the peak demand. The manuscript proposes that India has to consider solar thermal technology that can be ramped up and down, namely, the molten-salt solar tower technology (STT). Based on the direct solar irradiance data there are about 6000 sq. km of land with 7.5 to 8.0 kWh/m(2)/day and about 12 000 sq. km with 7.0 to 7.5 kWh/m(2)/day where such STT plants can be set up. Cost analysis demonstrates that the capital cost of STT plant is roughly (sic) 389 million per MW. This is quite competitive compared to the nuclear and coal thermal technologies because these technologies have high operational costs.

AB  - This article presents hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) tuned automatic generation controller for two areas interconnected multisource power system model. The control areas consist of thermal, hydro, and doubly fed induction generator-based wind power plants. The optimal tuning of AGC controller using genetic algorithm is less robust due to larger standard deviation of the fitness values. Therefore, Taguchi method which is based on modified statistical approach and has systematic reasoning ability is used to enhance the performance of genetic algorithm. The simulation study is carried out with the optimum gains of AGC controller obtained from HTGA, conventional GA and conventional techniques. The dynamic stability of the power system model is examined to analyze the performance of the HTGA technique. From investigations it is quite clear that the optimum gains of AGC system obtained from HTGA technique has better response in the dynamic stability of the interconnected multisource power system as compared to genetic algorithm and conventional technique.

TI  - Old wine in new bottles: reaction norms in salmonid fishes
VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 421-437
AB  - Genetic variability in reaction norms reflects differences in the ability of individuals, populations and ultimately species to respond to environmental change. By increasing our understanding of how genotype x environment interactions influence evolution, studies of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity serve to refine our capacity to predict how populations will respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental variability, including climate change. Given the extraordinary variability in morphology, behaviour and life history in salmonids, one might anticipate the research milieu on reaction norms in these fishes to be empirically rich and intellectually engaging. Here, I undertake a review of genetic variability in continuous and discontinuous (threshold) norms of reaction in salmonid fishes, as determined primarily (but not exclusively) by common-garden experiments. Although in its infancy from a numerical publication perspective, there is taxonomically broad evidence of genetic differentiation in continuous, threshold and bivariate reaction norms among individuals, families and populations (including inter-population hybrids and backcrosses) for traits as divergent as embryonic development, age and size at maturity, and gene expression. There is compelling inferential evidence that plasticity is heritable and that population differences in reaction norms can reflect adaptive responses, by natural selection, to local environments. As a stimulus for future work, a series of 20 research questions are identified that focus on reaction-norm variability, selection, costs and constraints, demographic and conservation consequences, and genetic markers and correlates of phenotypic plasticity.

VL  - 118

SP  - 423-430
AB  - We investigated the effect of water constraints on yearling Lacerta vivipara, a widespread species of lizard inhabiting European peat bogs and heath land. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate plasticity of growth rate, activity level and preferred body temperature. We subjected individuals of two source habitats (dry vs humid) to two laboratory conditions of water supply resulting in different air relative humidity and water availability (high vs low). We observed that a low water supply induced a lower growth rate and lower activity level, suggesting that growth limitation is correlated with adaptive responses to avoid dehydration. However, individuals from the two habitats selected different body temperatures when restricted in water and showed different ratios between growth and activity. This suggests that there is population variability in phenotypic plasticity with respect to water availability in the habitat. Field observations conducted in six natural populations, classified into two groups (dry vs humid habitat) also suggest that growth rate in nature is constrained by water availability.

VL  - 11

SP  - 3257-3267
AB  - In this research article, a maiden approach of hybrid adaptive gbest' guided gravitational search and pattern search (hGGSA-PS) optimization method are proposed for load frequency control (LFC) of multi-area interconnected power system considering the nonlinear effect of generation rate constraint (GRC). At first, the two area single stage thermal-thermal power system with conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is analyzed and the parameters of the PID controller are optimized by the proposed technique. Initially, the gbest' guided gravitational search algorithm (GGSA) using integral time absolute error (ITAE) fitness function is used and then pattern search (PS) technique is employed to fine-tune the obtained best solution from the GGSA. The supremacy of the hGGSA-PS optimized PID controller is presented by comparing its results with other modern soft computing techniques. Later in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed controller, the sensitive analysis is performed. Finally, the proposed technique is extended to a two area multi-source power system. The parameters of the controller for each area are optimized using the novel hGGSA-PS technique. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the proposed technique has superior performance than the prior results with lesser settling time and different performance index values.

TI  - Social dimensions of physiological responses to global climate change: what we can learn from ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
VL  - 25
SP  - 29-40
AB  - Organisms possess a wide range of physiological mechanisms to cope with climate change, yet most of what we know about these mechanisms comes from solitary organisms. Because there is a tight linkage between climate change and organismal physiologies, understanding the physiological mechanisms driving the responses of species to climate change has emerged as a research priority in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, responses become more complex when considering social organisms, as their responses to a changing climate can involve hundreds or even thousands of individuals that make up a single colony. Ants are especially good model systems for how social organisms may physiologically cope with global changes in climate, as they are geographically widespread and occur across diverse climatic regimes. Surprisingly, ants have received remarkably little attention in context of physiological responses to climate change given their ubiquity and key roles in many ecosystems. In particular, we have yet to bridge the gap between individual and colony-level responses to climate change in social organisms. In this review, we use ants as a focal taxon to examine the general patterns and mechanisms associated with thermal physiology and performance in individuals; how colony-level performance might differ in social organisms; and where the fields of physiological ecology and myrmecology can converge to better understand how ants will respond to anthropogenic changes in climate.

TI  - Pine Needles as Potential Energy Feedstock: Availability in the Central Himalayan State of Uttarakhand, India
VL  - 23
AB  - The amount of pine needles (pinus roxburgii) potentially available for use as energy feedstock in the Central Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in India has been estimated. It involves estimating the gross annual amount of pine needle yield followed by a comprehensive identification and quantification of the factors that affect the net annual pine needle yield available as energy feedstock. These factors include considerations such as accessibility, alternative uses, forest fires, other losses, etc., that are influenced by aspects ranging from physical constraints to traditional societal traits. Tree canopy cover method has been used for estimating the gross annual pine needle yield. The information on canopy density is obtained from remote sensing data, that forms the basis for forest classification. The annual gross pine needle yield has been estimated at 1.9 million tonnes while the annual net pine needle yield at 1.33 million tonnes. The annual primary energy potential of pine needles available as energy feedstock has also been estimated. For annual net energy potential estimation, thermal and electrical routes are considered. Electrical energy generation from pine needles using thermochemical conversion has been examined and the corresponding potential for electricity generation been estimated. An installed capacity of 789 MW can be supported with pine needles feedstock for supplying electricity in rural areas for five hours a day. For round the clock generation, an installed capacity of 165 MW can be supported by the pine needle energy feedstock.

TI  - Investigating the techno-economic perspectives of high wind energy production in remote vs interconnected island networks
VL  - 173
SP  - 238-254
AB  - The electrification of the non-interconnected Greek islands is mainly based on Autonomous Power Stations (APS), which consume conventional fossil fuels at high energy production cost, while in most cases the contribution of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) (mainly wind) accounts for a small percentage of total electricity generation in these regions. On the basis of comparative analysis of alternative "development scenarios" for electricity generation, the main objective of the present study is to investigate the techno-economic viability of high Wind Energy (WE) share at local (island) level, in accordance to the energy and climate change commitments undertaken by the country, having as central feature large-scale penetration of RES. In this context, the possibilities of increasing WE contribution are examined through the use of an integrated theoretical model developed from first principles, assuming two main possible scenarios for covering future electrification needs of a medium-sized Greek island, i.e. Lesbos. The first scenario (S1) is based on autonomous development of the island keep using as main source for electricity generation oil products. The second scenario (S2) involves the interconnection (IC) of the island with the mainland grid for satisfying part of electricity demand by establishing two alternative solutions, i.e. S2a: without the contribution of local Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and S2b: TPP are maintained to ensure electrification of the island. Subsequently, the economic feasibility of the above options is investigated in terms of their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), calculated for the time-period 20202045, including also a sensitivity analysis on worst/reference/best Cases for future electricity demand and production cost. According to the obtained results, IC of Lesbos island with the mainland grid presents considerable economic interest in comparison to autonomous development, with WE having a dominant and an essential role towards that direction.

TI  - Operational and environmental performance in China's thermal power industry: Taking an effectiveness measure as complement to an efficiency measure
VL  - 192
SP  - 254-270
AB  - The trend toward a more fiercely competitive and strictly environmentally regulated electricity market in several countries, including China has led to efforts by both industry and government to develop advanced performance evaluation models that adapt to new evaluation requirements. Traditional operational and environmental efficiency measures do not fully consider the influence of market competition and environmental regulations and, thus, are not sufficient for the thermal power industry to evaluate its operational performance with respect to specific marketing goals (operational effectiveness) and its environmental performance with respect to specific emissions reduction targets (environmental effectiveness). As a complement to an operational efficiency measure, an operational effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to increase its electricity generation through the improvement of operational efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its electricity generation activities to match electricity demand. In addition, as a complement to an environmental efficiency measure, an environmental effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to decrease its pollutant emissions through the improvement of environmental efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its emissions abatement activities to fulfill environmental regulations. Furthermore, an environmental effectiveness measure helps the government regulator to verify the rationality of its emissions reduction targets assigned to the thermal power industry. Several newly developed effectiveness measurements based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) were utilized in this study to evaluate the operational and environmental performance of the thermal power industry in China during 2006-2013. Both efficiency and effectiveness were evaluated from the three perspectives of operational, environmental, and joint adjustments to each electricity production system. The operational and environmental performance changes over time were also captured through an effectiveness measure based on the global Malmquist productivity index. Our empirical results indicated that the performance of China's thermal power industry experienced significant progress during the study period and that policies regarding the development and regulation of the thermal power industry yielded the expected effects. However, the emissions reduction targets assigned to China's thermal power industry are loose and conservative. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating sustainable location for harvesting solar power using geographical information systems and remote sensing methods
VL  - 41

SP  - 51-60
AB  - In the last few decades, Renewable energy has received remarkable attention. This is partially because fossil fuels are depleting and the necessity for energy is rising because of the increasing population of the world. Among renewable sources of energy, solar energy is one such type that is becoming increasingly popular because it is inexhaustible, clean, and reliable. Solar radiation is obtained as heat and light that can be converted by solar thermal power generation into valuable thermal energy or electricity generation. With regard to efficiency and financial viability, the availability of trusted data on solar radiation is crucial to forecast the performance of solar power plants at different places in the country. This paper describes a general integrated structure for assessing land suitability for ideal positioning of photovoltaic solar energy panels based on a variety of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing methods. The Location Viability Assessment, i.e. the areas appropriate for harvesting Solar Energy, is measured based on Global, Diffuse, Direct Solar Radiation Data that estimates the potential of the Solar Power Generation sites. Two interrelated steps were implemented in this study. First, Remote Sensing was used, including LANDSAT 8 satellite data, to extract the study area's land use/land cover map. Second, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to model the research zone map of aspect angles and slope maps. These results indicate the potential sites for Solar Power Generation.

TI  - Mortality and Recovery of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in Response to Winter Temperatures and Predictions for the Future
VL  - 8
IS  - 12
AB  - Eastern (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlocks (T. caroliniana) of eastern North America have been attacked by the non-native hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) since the first half of the 20th century. Unlike most insects, HWA develops through one generation from fall to late winter, exposing this insect to the lethal effects of winter temperatures. The mortality inflicted by winter temperatures on HWA determines the surviving population density as well as its ability to spread to uninfested areas. With the ongoing changes in climate, knowledge of this species' ability to survive and spread in the future can help land managers prepare for its management. This study began during the winter of 2014 and ended in the spring of 2017. During this period, winter mortality of HWA was recorded at 100 sites from Maine to Georgia (n = 209). Changes in population density from the sistens to the succeeding progrediens generation were recorded at 24 sites (n = 35). Models were developed to predict HWA mortality using the lowest minimum temperature prior to the mortality assessment date, the number of days with mean temperature <-1 degrees C, and the mean daily temperature of the three days preceding that minimum. Models were also developed to predict population density changes from the overwintering sistens generation to the following progrediens generation. Future projections under climate change showed increases in winter survival and population growth rates over time. Especially towards the northeastern edge of T. canadensis' distribution as minimum temperatures are predicted to increase at a greater rate. This will result in an increase in density throughout its current distribution and expansion northward causing an increase in its impact on eastern Tsuga spp.

TI  - Mass effects mediate coexistence in competing shrews
VL  - 89
IS  - 7
SP  - 2033-2042
AB  - Recent developments in metacommunity theory have raised awareness that processes occurring at regional scales might interfere with local dynamics and affect conditions for the local coexistence of competing species. Four main paradigms are recognized in this context (namely, neutral, patch-dynamics, species-sorting, and mass-effect), which differ according to the role assigned to ecological or life-history differences among competing species, as well as to the relative time scale of regional vs. local dynamics. We investigated the patterns of regional and local coexistence of two species of shrews (Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus) sharing a similar diet (generalist insectivores) over four generations, in a spatially structured habitat at the altitudinal limit of their distributions. Local populations were small, and regional dynamics were strong, with high rates of extinction and recolonization. Niche analysis revealed significant habitat differentiation on a few important variables, including temperature and availability of winter resting sites. In sites suitable for both species, we found instances of local coexistence with no evidence of competitive exclusion. Patterns of temporal succession did not differ from random, with no suggestion of a colonization-competition trade-off. Altogether, our data provide support for the mass-effect paradigm, where regional coexistence is mediated by specialization on different habitat types, and local coexistence by rescue effects from source sites. The strong regional dynamics and demographic stochasticity, together with high dispersal rates, presumably contributed to mass effects by overriding local differences in specific competitive abilities.

TI  - Prolonged dormancy in Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae): A ten-year field study with implications for crop rotation
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 499-504
AB  - This 10-yr field study examined prolonged dormancy (dormancy of more than 1 yr) in Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), from Upstate New York. The research focused on whether the life cycle of the Colorado potato beetle could reduce the effectiveness of crop rotation as a pest management tactic. One set of experiments quantified variation in the occurrence and duration of prolonged dormancy in a natural population. A second set of experiments tested the effect of artificial selection for increased incidence of prolonged dormancy. Of the approximate to12,600 unselected beetles in the field cages overall survival (= % emergence) averaged 56.5 +/- 18.4% (mean +/- SD, range = 23.5-84.3%, n = 19 cages). Most (97.7%) of the emerging beetles surfaced after one winter; the remainder (2.3%) emerged after more than one winter in dormancy. The range of variation in the incidence of prolonged dormancy among the experimental cages during the 10-yr period was 0-7.2%. The incidence of emergence from prolonged dormancy was higher among beetles from the first summer-generation [mean +/-SD = 3.0 +/- 2.0% (10 cages)] than from the second [1.0 +/- 1.5 (7 cages)], and significantly more females than males emerged from prolonged dormancy (female:male = 97:64). Most (approximate to70%) of the beetles that underwent prolonged dormancy emerged after two winters in diapause; the majority of the remainder (approximate to29%) emerged after 3-7 yr in diapause; and, one beetle (approximate to1%) emerged after 9 yr. Artificial selection for prolonged dormancy over three generations did not result in a significant increase in the incidence of delayed emergence, nor did it result in incidences of prolonged dormancy greater than those in the controls (unselected field-reared beetles and lines selected for 1-yr dormancy). From our results, we conclude that the Colorado potato beetle has considerable variation in both the incidence and duration of prolonged dormancy, and that this variation has strong environmental and genetic determinants. Viewed in the context of the beetle's life history, these findings lead us to suggest that the evolution of resistance to crop rotation would require strong and sustained selection over large areas.

VL  - 36
IS  - 6
SP  - 671-679
AB  - Critical investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of parasitic nematodes have been hindered by a lack of modern molecular genetic techniques for these organisms. One such technique is transgenesis. To our knowledge, the findings reported here demonstrate the first heritable DNA transformation and transgene expression in the intestinal parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. When microinjected into the syncitial gonads of free-living S. stercoralis females, a construct fusing the S. stercoralis era-1 promoter, the coding region for green fluorescent protein (gfp) and the S. stercoralis era-1 3' untranslated region was expressed in intestinal cells of normally developing F1 transgenic larvae. The frequency of transformation and GFP expression among F1 larvae was 5.3%. By contrast, expression of several promoter::gfp fusions incorporating only Caenorhabditis elegans regulatory elements was restricted to abortively developing F1 embryos of S. stercoralis. Despite its lack of regulated expression, PCR revealed that one of these C. elegans-based vector constructs, the sur-5::gfp fusion, is incorporated into F1 larval progeny of microinjected female worms and then transmitted to the F2 through F5 generations during two host passages conducted without selection and punctuated by free-living generations reared in culture. Heritable DNA transformation and regulated transgene expression, as demonstrated here for S. stercoralis, constitute the essential components of a practical system for transgenesis in this parasite. This system has the potential to significantly advance the molecular and cellular biological study of S. stercoralis and of parasitic nematodes generally.

TI  - RESTRICTED MUMPS-VIRUS INFECTION OF CELLS DERIVED FROM NORMAL HUMAN JOINT TISSUE
VL  - 72
SP  - 339-347
AB  - Mumps virus (MuV) is known to be associated with acute arthritis and may also have a role in chronic inflammatory joint disease. The mechanism of induction of joint inflammation is not known but may be associated with direct invasion of joint tissue. To investigate the possibility of presistent intra-articular infection, the interaction of MuV with primary cells from normal human joint tissue was examined. These mixed cultures of synovial membrane cells and chondrocytes were found to be semi-permissive to the virus; only a small proportion of cells (5 to 20%) were infected and produced low titres of progeny virions. In addition, little viral antigen was detected on the cell surface relative to that found on Vero cells. This restricted infection of synovial membrane cells was related to a severely decreased synthesis of the viral glycoproteins, fusion and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase, and the membrane protein in comparison to the levels found in Vero cells. Persistent infections were readily established and could be maintained for 2 to 3 months. During the first month, the infection remained highly focal and supernatant viral titres were low. Thereafter both the percentage of infected cells and viral titres increased until finally the cultures were killed. No evidence was obtained for the generation of temperature-sensitive mutants or defective interfering particles during long-term infection, but the persistent virus derived from the cultures gave cloudy plaques and induced no fusion in Vero cells until passaged. This study has shown that human synovial tissue cells have the intrinsic ability to support MuV replication and persistence which may be important in the pathogenesis of mumps arthritis.

TI  - Fitness Dependent Optimizer-Based Automatic Generation Control of Multi-Source Interconnected Power System With Non-Linearities
VL  - 8
SP  - 100989-101003
AB  - This paper proposed an improved structure of Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller called as Integral Proportional Derivative (I-PD), applied for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of Multi-Source Interconnected Power System (IPS). The parameters of the proposed controller are optimized with a newly developed, powerful, nature-inspired meta-heuristic technique known as Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO). To show the efficacy of the proposed controller and the technique used, they have been tested on three different system models. Initially, a two-equal area of diverse source generation including reheat-thermal, gas, and hydro power system is considered. In the second scenario, the same power system model is used with addition of two non-linearities; Generation Rate Constraint (GRC) and Governor Dead Band (GDB). Lastly, multiple non-linearities including Governor Dead Band (GDB), Time Delay (TD), Generation Rate Constraint (GRC), and Boiler Dynamics (BD) have been considered to make the initial system more realistic and practical. The outcome from the proposed techniques is also compared with some recently meta-heuristic algorithms such as Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly Algorithm (FA). From the results, it has been perceived that the proposed technique shows superior performance in respect of Overshoot (O-sh), Undershoot (U-sh) and Settling Time (T-s) of the system frequency.

VL  - 22
IS  - 8
SP  - 3474-3485
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids are a new generation in vitro cell model, however, their applications are severely limited by difficulties in their generation. Here patterned poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogel films were synthesized for their generation. Instead of polymerization of HEMA monomers in the presence of a cross-linker, here the PHEMA films were synthesized by cross-linking furan-fimctionalized linear PHEMA, PHEMA-furan, and maleimide-functionalized linear PHEMA, PHEMA-mal, via Diets-Alder (DA) reaction between furan and maleimide groups. A thermal treatment temperature of 75 degrees C was chosen for the cross-linking reaction. The occurrence of DA reaction was confirmed by IR spectra. Using this method, cross-linked PHEMA films with smooth surface were successfully synthesized in situ in the well of cell culture plates. The films were then patterned by simply adding water to swell them. Highly ordered, honeycomb-like wrinkling patterns were successfully obtained by adjusting the furan and maleimide contents in the precursor linear polymers. The patterned hydrogel films were used to generate multicellular spheroids. Guided by the patterns, 3D spheroids with narrow size distribution, tunable size, and high cell viability were successfully obtained. The patterned PHEMA films reported here exhibited a lot of advantages. The patterning method was quite simple and required no template or special equipment. They were synthesized in situ in commercial cell culture plates. Particularly, thanks to the clean nature of the DA reaction, no low molecular weight monomer, cross-linker, initiator, or catalyst, which were potentially cytotoxic, was involved in the film synthesis, and no byproduct was produced and left in the film. The resulting films presented a high biocompatibility, allowing the avoidance of the tedious washing step. The films synthesized here were expected to have high potential for massive production of well-defined multicellular spheroids.

TI  - Determination of an economic energy supply structure based on biomass using a mixed-integer linear optimization model
VL  - 16
SP  - S91-S102
AB  - Biomass can be used for heat or power generation or for a combined heat and power generation in order to substitute fossil fuels. As a result of the low fossil fuel prices and the higher investment and operating costs of biomass-fired plants, the energy use of biomass has to be checked for every case in each application area. The preferred field of application is the rural area because of the reasonable relation between the potential of biomass and the transportation distances that have a great influence on the economic viability. The knowledge about the location of consumers as well as of the energy plants and the possible laying of a district heating pipe is important for the clarification of an optimal heat supply structure in an isolated area. A mixed-integer linear optimization model based on the dynamical evaluation of economic efficiency can help to find the most economical and ecological supply structure. The model has to be developed for three different types of operating companies. The influences of different parameters on the target function can be analyzed by defining scenarios and by running sensitivity analyses. The results show that the energy prices have the greatest influence on the economy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Heat-related mortality under climate change and the impact of adaptation through air conditioning: A case study from Thessaloniki, Greece
VL  - 199
AB  - Climate change is expected to increase heat-related mortality across the world. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) studies are used to quantify the impact of higher temperatures, taking into account the effect of population adaptation. Although air-conditioning (AC) is one of the main drivers of technological adaptation to heat, the health impacts associated with AC-induced air pollution have not been examined in detail. This study uses the city of Thessaloniki, Greece as a case study and aims to estimate the future heat-related mortality, the residential cooling demand, and the adaptation trade-off between averted heat-related and increased air pollution cardiorespiratory mortality. Using temperature and population projections under different Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CIMP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSPs), a HIA model was developed for the future heat and air pollution cardiorespiratory mortality. Counterfactual scenarios of either black carbon (BC) or natural gas (NG) being the fuel source for electricity generation were included in the HIA. The results indicate that the heat-related cardiorespiratory mortality in Thessaloniki will increase and the excess of annual heat-related deaths in 2080-2099 will range from 2.4 (95% CI: 0.0-20.9) under SSP1-2.6 to 433.7 (95% CI: 66.9-1070) under SSP5-8.5. Population adaptation will attenuate the heat-related mortality, although the latter may be counterbalanced by the higher air pollution-related mortality due to increased AC, especially under moderate SSP scenarios and coal-fired power plants. Future studies examining the health effects of warmer temperatures need to account for the impact of both adaptation and increased penetration and use of AC.

VL  - 162

SP  - 151-168
AB  - Cities demand a large proportion of energy supplies while exporting significant amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW). Landfill regulations, self-sufficiency and proximity principles have induced shifts in waste management techniques. Historically, energy security, best use of resources, renewable energy use and climate change mitigation have not been leveraged in waste management strategies. This study examines emerging treatment technologies that could make a contribution in the aforementioned areas and have the potential for working at smaller scales in urban locations. The energy efficiency and environmental and economic performance of two thermal treatment technologies are presented, thus elucidating their potential role in urban strategies in the light of rising energy prices, decarbonisation of the economy, taxation and full use of incentives. The study illustrates that considering the full life cycle, beyond waste management, will enable more strategic technology utilisation. Improvements in viability over time according to evolving regulations are assessed, demonstrating how possible contributions to renewable heat and power can enhance profitability. Combustion technology is analysed for a medium-scale configuration, processing 100 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) using a steam turbine for heat and power generation, and a large-scale 250 ktpa configuration. Fluidised bed gasification is analysed at the small scale (50 ktpa) and medium scale (100 ktpa) using a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) for heat and power generation. One key aspect is the evaluation of the processing of waste into a predominantly renewable fuel capable of running a gas and steam turbine while rendering a significant proportion of residues reusable. Emission profiles and mass and energy balances are presented quantitatively. A discounted cash flow of material and energy outputs incorporating the effect of incentives across deployment scenarios is presented. Furthermore, key technical and policy pre-conditions are discussed.

TI  - Valorization of food waste into hydrogen: Energy potential, economic feasibility and environmental impact analysis
VL  - 324
AB  - Hydrogen gas is widely acknowledged as a significant energy carrier worldwide. Hydrogen gas derived from sustainable sources could be used as an alternative to fossil fuel for electricity generation with zero emission of hazardous pollutants. Food waste valorization to hydrogen is a viable energy source with potential economic benefits. The current study examines the economic viability and environmental effect of producing hydrogen from food waste in China using biogas steam reforming for power generation. The key findings show that the steam reforming of biogas from food waste could produce 221.12 billion kg of hydrogen gas. The quantity of hydrogen gas yield could generate 661.97 TWh of electricity. It was found that the consumption of the available electricity from the hydrogen gas could displace 15,482.26 M liters of diesel fuel combustion. The amount of diesel fuel consumption avoided can reduce global warming by 42,041.90 kt CO(2)e. It was also discovered that hydrogen has an appealing ecological efficiency of 94.64% when used as a source of energy generation. According to the outcomes of the economic analysis, the food waste to hydrogen project is economically feasible in all of China's provinces. The average hydrogen production cost, return on investment, the payback period is $0.814/kWh, 29.8%, and 7.2 years. This study could provide scientific data for investment and decision-making on ecological sustainability in food waste to hydrogen initiatives in China and other emerging nations with a similar culture.

VL  - 16

SP  - 4886-4907
AB  - The seven species of sea turtles occupy a diversity of niches, and have a history tracing back over 100 million years, yet all share basic life-history features, including exceptional navigation skills and periodic migrations from feeding to breeding habitats. Here, we review the biogeographic, behavioural, and ecological factors that shape the distribution of genetic diversity in sea turtles. Natal homing, wherein turtles return to their region of origin for mating and nesting, has been demonstrated with mtDNA sequences. These maternally inherited markers show strong population structure among nesting colonies while nuclear loci reveal a contrasting pattern of male-mediated gene flow, a phenomenon termed 'complex population structure'. Mixed-stock analyses indicate that multiple nesting colonies can contribute to feeding aggregates, such that exploitation of turtles in these habitats can reduce breeding populations across the region. The mtDNA data also demonstrate migrations across entire ocean basins, some of the longest movements of marine vertebrates. Multiple paternity occurs at reported rates of 0-100%, and can vary by as much as 9-100% within species. Hybridization in almost every combination among members of the Cheloniidae has been documented but the frequency and ultimate ramifications of hybridization are not clear. The global phylogeography of sea turtles reveals a gradient based on habitat preference and thermal regime. The cold-tolerant leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) shows no evolutionary partitions between Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations, while the tropical green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea vs. L. kempi) have ancient separations between oceans. Ridleys and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) also show more recent colonization between ocean basins, probably mediated by warm-water gyres that occasionally traverse the frigid upwelling zone in southern Africa. These rare events may be sufficient to prevent allopatric speciation under contemporary geographic and climatic conditions. Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of marine turtle biology and evolution, but significant gaps persist and provide challenges for the next generation of sea turtle geneticists.

TI  - Various Wolbachia genotypes differently influence host Drosophila dopamine metabolism and survival under heat stress conditions
VL  - 17
AB  - Background: One of the most widespread prokaryotic symbionts of invertebrates is the intracellular bacteria of Wolbachia genus which can be found in about 50% of insect species. Wolbachia causes both parasitic and mutualistic effects on its host that include manipulating the host reproductive systems in order to increase their transmission through the female germline, and increasing the host fitness. One of the mechanisms, promoting adaptation in biological organisms, is a non-specific neuroendocrine stress reaction. In insects, this reaction includes catecholamines, dopamine, serotonin and octopamine, which act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neurohormones. The level of dopamine metabolism correlates with heat stress resistance in Drosophila adults. Results: To examine Wolbachia effect on Drosophila survival under heat stress and dopamine metabolism we used five strains carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 strain and cytoplasmic backgrounds with different genotype variants of Wolbachia (produced by 20 backcrosses of Bi90 males with appropriate source of Wolbachia). Non-infected Bi90 strain (treated with tetracycline for 3 generations) was used as a control group. We demonstrated that two of five investigated Wolbachia variants promote changes in Drosophila heat stress resistance and activity of enzymes that produce and degrade dopamine, alkaline phosphatase and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. What is especially interesting, wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia increases stress resistance and the intensity of dopamine metabolism, whereas wMelPop strain decreases them. wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on the survival under heat stress or dopamine metabolism. L-DOPA treatment, known to increase the dopamine content in Drosophila, levels the difference in survival under heat stress between all studied groups. Conclusions: The genotype of symbiont determines the effect that the symbiont has on the stress resistance of the host insect.

TI  - Novel Temperature-Dependent Development Rate Models for Postdiapause Egg Eclosion of Three Important Arthropod Pests Found in Commercial Christmas Tree Plantations of Southern Quebec, Canada
VL  - 47

SP  - 715-724
AB  - The balsam twig aphid Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the spruce spider mite Oligonychus ununguis (Jacobi) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the pine needle scale Chionaspis pinifoliae (Fitch) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) are three important pests for the Christmas tree industry of Quebec, Canada. Temperaturedependent development rates for postdiapause overwintering eggs of these species have never been studied for populations of southern Quebec, where the vast majority of Christmas trees are grown. The accumulation of physiological time in growing degree days (GDD) is a standard tool to predict egg eclosion dates for pests, when first generation immatures are most vulnerable to insecticidal control. Development rates for postdiapause eggs were tested at four or five constant temperatures in the 11-23 degrees C range under controlled conditions, based on time before hatching for eggs collected in a balsam fir plantation in late winter. The standard linear model and three published nonlinear models were fitted to the data and compared for their ability to estimate key biological temperature parameters and to predict development rates of postdiapause eggs. Validation of model predictions of egg eclosion time on balsam fir in the field was reasonably accurate using the classical linear model where field-accumulated GDD were calculated with a particular interpretation of the average method based on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The linear model could predict mean egg eclosion within around 5 d of eclosion dates observed in the field.

VL  - 209
SP  - 313-317
AB  - Microalgae have been considered as the feedstock for the third generation biofuels production, given its high lipid content and fast productivity. Herein, a catalytic approach for microalgae liquefaction to biocrude is examined in a temperature range of 250-300 degrees C in methanol and ethanol over zeolites. Higher biocrude yield was achieved in ethanol and at lower temperatures, while better quality biocrude with higher light biocrude ratio and lower average molecular weight (M-w) was favored in methanol and at higher temperatures. Application of zeolites improves the biocrude quality significantly. Among the catalysts, HY shows the strongest acidity and performs the best to produce high quality biocrude. Solid residues have been extensively explored with thermal gravity analysis and elemental analysis. It is reported for the first time that up to 99 wt.% of sulfur is deposited in the solid residue at 250 degrees C for both solvents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 60

SP  - 605-621
AB  - Climate risks pervade agriculture and generate major consequences on crop production. We do not know what the next season will be like, let alone the season 30 years hence. Yet farmers need to decide on genotype and management (GxM) combinations in advance of the season and in the face of this environment risk. Beyond that, breeders must target traits for future genotypes up to 10 years ahead of their release. Here we present the case for next generation design of GxMxE for crop adaptation in future climates. We focus on adaptation to drought and high-temperature shock in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in Australia, but the concepts are generic. The considerable knowledge of climate, both past and future, gives us insight into climate variability and trends. We know that CO2 and temperature are increasing, and this influences drought and high-temperature risks for crops. We also have considerable knowledge of crop growth and development responses to CO2, drought, and high temperature that have been integrated into advanced crop simulation models. Here we explore by simulation the design of crops best suited to current and future environments. A yield-risk framework is used to identify adapted GxM combinations. The results in this case study indicate the urgent need for high-temperature tolerance to effects on seed set. Further, existing approaches to GxMfor effective use of water through the crop cycle will not be adequate to maintain productivity once global warming of similar to 2 degrees C is reached. Improvement in transpiration efficiency offered the avenue with best potential for advancing adaptation relevant to future climates.

AB  - Experiments were performed on first generation hybrid populations, obtained by reciprocally crossing two Drosophila melanogaster strains, one inbred continuously, and the other, before and after keeping parents in mass-cultures for some generations. Parental populations were divided at random into two groups. One group was permitted to lay eggs at 16 +/- 1.00 degrees C, and the other, at 25 +/- 100 degrees C. The adult longevity and the female fecundity, which provide some measure of fitness in the treated and untreated populations, were measured at 25 +/- 1.00 degrees C. While no appreciable differences were observed in the physiological parameters measured in the combined sexes, the average adult life span of males in one hybrid was considerably increased compared with that of males in the other population. It is suggested that the observed differences in the longevity are due to the X-chromosome differences and, possibly, to their interactions with the other chromosomes. On the other hand, the mean adult longevity of males in the treated populations was more adversely affected than that of females, indicating a sex difference for surviving, as adults, a temperature change introduced during development. Because significant differences in the average adult life span, although not in the average egg production, were found in the two hybrids, the presence of some kind of maternal effect is indicated. A comparison of the experimental populations revealed a drastic reduction in the fitness compared with the controls. Evidence is presented to show that this is due to the inability of homeostatic mechanisms to regulate effectively in a changed environment and that, besides heterozygosity, the nature of integration of genotypes is essential for eliciting homeostatic or adaptive responses contributory to the fitness of a population.

TI  - Beyond the infant in your arms: effects of climate change last for generations
VL  - 118
IS  - 2
SP  - 224-229
AB  - Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. In addition to short-term reproductive health impacts, climate -related events will influence the risks of long-term and intergenerational mortality and morbidity for both birthing parents and offspring. As climate conditions continue to deteriorate in future generations, less healthy parents will give birth to less healthy offspring, who themselves will experience increased risk of reproductive outcomes. This intergenerational process causes a repeating cycle of poor parental preconception health, gestational complications, and poor offspring health, which leads to suboptimal precon-ception health among those offspring when they reach reproductive age. Because our ongoing efforts mostly focus on helping families achieve and maintain a healthy pregnancy, a critical need to think beyond the infant in our arms and consider the long-term implica-tions of climate change exists. Such efforts may involve policy strengthening efforts to reduce emissions, further engaging health care providers as active advocates, ensuring equitable and sustainable mitigation and adaptable strategies, and conducting more research that yields actionable data to guide policy efforts, especially in regions and populations most affected by climate change.

AB  - Polyolefin coordination catalysts useful for producing UHMWPE are surveyed, including classic Ziegler-Natta (ZN), current commercial generation ZN, metallocene single site, and non-metallocene. Catalysts were prepared and compared for productivity and selected polymer properties under a variety of conditions. Classic catalysts used were long lived TiCl3 crystalline metal clusters made by reducing TiCl4 by co-crystallizing with aluminum alkyls. Data presented from the synthesis and polymerization with these catalysts shows temperature and molecular weight response that were expected for these systems. Commercially available titanium on silica/magnesium chloride was activated with aluminum alkyls and had higher activity than those of the previous generation. Conditions for polymerizing supported metallocenes for producing polymers in the UHMWPE range were described. Long range "non-metallocenes" of the phenoxy-imine class were activated with MAO was tested and reported.

VL  - 28

SP  - 577-587
AB  - The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, spends the majority of its life cycle within the phloem of pine trees, experiencing exposure to temperatures below -30 degrees C in many parts of their expansive range. To better understand cold tolerance capabilities of this insect, seasonal patterns of cold-hardiness, as measured by supercooling points in the laboratory, were compared with seasonal patterns of host tree phloem temperatures at several geographic sites for 2 beetle generations. Larvae were found to be intolerant of tissue freezing, and supercooling points measured appear to be a reasonable estimate of the lower limit for survival. Of the compounds analyzed, glycerol was found to be the major cryoprotectant. No differences in supercooling points were found among instars or between larvae collected from the north and south aspect of tree boles. Both phloem temperatures and supercooling points of larvae collected from within the phloem were found to be different among the geographic sites sampled. Mountain pine beetle larvae appear to respond to seasonal and yearly fluctuations in microhabitat temperatures by adjusting levels of cold hardening.

CSTs are commonly used to start up heavy loads for example mining conveyors and produces heat during startup. Models for CST clutch heat generation together with thermal behavior has been developed and investigated. This includes a temperature model together with a kinetic model of the gearbox and a torque model of the clutch. Validation of separate model components and sensitivity analysis of parameters are conducted. The developed models are then compared by analyzing measurements and simulations to investigate generated heat during regular usage.

VL  - 193
SP  - 297-307
AB  - In order to attain emissions reduction targets to improve air quality and reduce global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) arise as alternatives to conventional vehicles fueled by fossil fuels. In this context, this work presents a comparative study between an EV and its conventional version, a medium-duty, diesel engine powered vehicle, from road tests following a standard cycle in urban driving conditions. The performance parameters evaluated are EV electric energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation and, for the conventional vehicle, exhaust CO2 emissions and energy consumption calculated from fuel consumption and heating value. Five scenarios were built to conduct an economic viability study in terms of payback and net present value (NPV). Considering the conditions applied, the results from the environmental analysis showed that CO2 emissions from the EV was 4.6 times lower in comparison with the diesel vehicle. On the other hand, the economic analysis revealed that the viability of the EV is compromised, mainly due to the imported parts with unfavorably high exchange rates. In the best scenario and not considering revenue from commercial application, the calculated payback period of the EV is 13 years of operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Continuous selection pressure to improve temperature acclimation of Tisochrysis lutea
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - Temperature plays a key role in outdoor industrial cultivation of microalgae. Improving the thermal tolerance of microalgae to both daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations can thus contribute to increase their annual productivity. A long term selection experiment was carried out to increase the thermal niche (temperature range for which the growth is possible) of a neutral lipid overproducing strain of Tisochrysis lutea. The experimental protocol consisted to submit cells to daily variations of temperature for 7 months. The stress intensity, defined as the amplitude of daily temperature variations, was progressively increased along successive selection cycles. Only the amplitude of the temperature variations were increased, the daily average temperature was kept constant along the experiment. This protocol resulted in a thermal niche increase by 3 degrees C (+16.5%), with an enhancement by 9% of the maximal growth rate. The selection process also affected T. lutea physiology, with a feature generally observed for 'cold-temperature' type of adaptation. The amount of total and neutral lipids was significantly increased, and eventually productivity was increased by 34%. This seven month selection experiment, carried out in a highly dynamic environment, challenges some of the hypotheses classically advanced to explain the temperature response of microalgae.

VL  - 10

AB  - The abundance and distribution of marine fishes is influenced by environmental conditions, predator-prey relationships, multispecies interactions, and direct human impacts, such as fishing. The adaptive response of the system depends on its structure and the pathways that link environmental factors to the taxon in question. The "Star Diagram" is a socio-ecological model of marine ecosystems that depicts the general pathways between climate, fish, and fisheries, and their intersection with climate policy and resource management. We illustrate its use by identifying the key factors, pathways and drivers that influence walleye pollock, crab, and sockeye salmon, under a warming scenario on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. This approach predicts that all three species will see reduced populations under a long-term warming scenario. Going forward, the challenge to managers is to balance the magnitude of the effect of harvest and the adaptability of their management system, with the scale and degree of resilience and the behavioral, physiological, or evolutionary adaptation of the ecosystem and its constituents. The Star Diagram provides a novel conceptual construct that managers can use to visualize and integrate the various aspects of the system into a holistic, socio-ecological management framework.

AB  - A piggyBac construct carrying two green fluorescent protein (GFP)-coding sequences one driven by Bombyx mori actin gene promoter and the other by Drosophila melanogaster heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) promoter were injected together with a nonautonomous helper plasmid containing an active piggyBac transposase gene into the posterior end of mature unfertilized eggs dissected from the ovaries of Athalia rosae (Hymenoptera: Symphyta). These injected eggs, which developed as haploid male embryos upon artificial activation, were cultured to adulthood. Of 278 injected eggs, 61 grew to G(0) haploid adult males. These G(0) haploid males were individually mated to diploid females. The progeny embryos (G(1) generation) were examined for GFP expression. Four GFP-positive embryos (from three independent G(0) matings) were obtained. Two eclosed as diploid adult G(1) females. Mature unfertilized eggs dissected from the GFP-positive G(1) diploid females were activated artificially, and the resultant embryos were examined for GFP expression, separated and cultured to adulthood (G(2) generation). The G(2) haploid embryos segregated to GFP-positive and negative individuals. By mating the G(2) adult haploid males individually to diploid females, stocks were established in which the piggyBac construct was stably integrated into the genome, as evidenced by GFP expression and Southern blot hybridization. The piggyBac transposition occurred at its canonical target TTAA sequence. These results, which demonstrate the first successful stable transposon-mediated germline transformation in Hymenoptera, will expand the usefulness of the piggyBac vector.

TI  - Deoxygenation of biobased molecules by decarboxylation and decarbonylation - a review on the role of heterogeneous, homogeneous and bio-catalysis
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
SP  - 3231-3250
AB  - Use of biomass is crucial for a sustainable supply of chemicals and fuels for future generations. Compared to fossil feedstocks, biomass is more functionalized and requires defunctionalisation to make it suitable for use. Deoxygenation is an important method of defunctionalisation. While thermal deoxygenation is possible, high energy input and lower reaction selectivity makes it less suitable for producing the desired chemicals and fuels. Catalytic deoxygenation is more successful by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, and when designed correctly, is more selective. Catalytic deoxygenation can be performed in various ways. Here we focus on decarboxylation and decarbonylation. There are several classes of catalysts: heterogeneous, homogeneous, bio- and organocatalysts and all have limitations. Homogeneous catalysts generally have superior selectivity and specificity but separation from the reaction is cumbersome. Heterogeneous catalysts are more readily isolated and can be utilised at high temperatures, however they have lower selectivity in complex reaction mixtures. While bio-catalysts can operate at ambient temperatures, the volumetric productivity is lower. Therefore it is not always apparent in advance which catalyst is the most suitable in terms of conversion and selectivity under optimal process conditions. Here we compare classes of catalysts for the decarboxylation and decarbonylation of biobased molecules and discuss their limitations and advantages. We mainly focus on the activity of the catalysts and find there is a strong correlation between specific activity (turn over frequency) and temperature for metal based catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous). Thus one is not more active than the other at the same temperature. Alternatively, enzymes have a higher turnover frequency but drawbacks (low volumetric productivity) should be overcome.

AB  - This study compares the economic viability of renewable energy technologies - wind, solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar thermal, biomass and wave power - to traditional generation technologies including hydroelectricity, nuclear power, coal power and gas power sources. The Levelised cost of Electricity (LCOE) for different generation technologies in Brazil are calculated by reviewing existing published literature and examining 13 case study projects. Initial results found that using a low (5%) discount rate, the hydroelectric plants had the lowest LCOE, but were only slightly cheaper than the wind power case studies. However, using a high (10%) discount rate, one of the wind power case studies actually had the lowest LCOE. Solar photovoltaic (PV) was found to be the most expensive technology followed by wave power and concentrated solar thermal power (CSP). It will be shown that grid connected distributed PV and concentrated solar thermal technology are largely undeveloped in Brazil due to the high price associated with importing solar power equipment into Brazil and also due to ineffective federal government policy. The environmental and social externality costs of fossil fuel plants and large scale hydroelectric dams (in the Amazon region) are also discussed. It will be demonstrated that wind power becomes the cheapest generation technology in Brazil, once all externality and transmission line costs are taken into consideration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 10
IS  - 6
AB  - Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of human gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Given that Salmonella is persistent in aquatic environments, this study examined the prevalence, levels and genotypic diversity of Salmonella isolates recovered from major rivers in an important agricultural region in northwestern Mexico. During a 13-month period, a total of 143 river water samples were collected and subjected to size-exclusion ultrafiltration, followed by enrichment, and selective media for Salmonella isolation and quantitation. The recovered Salmonella isolates were examined by next-generation sequencing for genome characterization. Salmonella prevalence in river water was lower in the winter months (0.65 MPN/100 mL) and significantly higher in the summer months (13.98 MPN/100 mL), and a Poisson regression model indicated a negative effect of pH and salinity and a positive effect of river water temperature (p = 0.00) on Salmonella levels. Molecular subtyping revealed Oranienburg, Anatum and Saintpaul were the most predominant Salmonella serovars. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogeny revealed that the detected 27 distinct serovars from river water clustered in two major clades. Multiple nonsynonymous SNPs were detected in stiA, sivH, and ratA, genes required for Salmonella fitness and survival, and these findings identified relevant markers to potentially develop improved methods for characterizing this pathogen.

VL  - 866
SP  - 182-+
AB  - The processes used to form an advanced PMOS SDE become increasing complex with each technology generation. Aggressive requirements for junction depth, sheet resistance and abruptness are difficult to satisfy with conventional technologies. The fundamental issues are the low productivity of implant systems at the required low boron implant energies and the diffusion rate of boron in silicon at the temperatures needed for activation. We propose an alternate process sequence with the goal of simplifying the process module by eliminating the Ge PAI implant and using a conventional spike anneal. Our approach is to utilize a ClusterCarbon implant to control boron diffusion, a ClusterBoroe (R) implant for high productivity at low process energy and a conventional spike anneal at moderate temperature. The ClusterCarbon (TM) implant uses the same ClusterIon (R) source and related system as the ClusterBoron implant. This process combination provides a solution to the technology requirements using conventional production tools, high productivity and a simple, direct path to optimizing the SDE conditions.

TI  - Adaptive phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation for temperature tolerance in freshwater zooplankton
VL  - 281
IS  - 1776
AB  - Many organisms have geographical distributions extending from the tropics to near polar regions or can experience up to 30 degrees C temperature variation within the lifespan of an individual. Two forms of evolutionary adaptation to such wide ranges in ambient temperatures are frequently discussed: local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. The freshwater planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna, whose range extends from South Africa to near arctic sites, shows strong phenotypic and genotypic variation in response to temperature. In this study, we use D. magna clones from 22 populations (one clone per population) ranging from latitude 0 degrees (Kenya) to 66 degrees North (White Sea) to explore the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation to high temperature tolerance. Temperature tolerance was studied as knockout time (time until immobilization, T-imm) at 37 degrees C in clones acclimatized to either 20 degrees C or 28 degrees C. Acclimatization to 28 degrees C strongly increased T-imm, testifying to adaptive phenotypic plasticity. At the same time, T-imm significantly correlated with average high temperature at the clones' sites of origin, suggesting local adaptation. As earlier studies have found that haemoglobin expression contributes to temperature tolerance, we also quantified haemoglobin concentration in experimental animals and found that both acclimatization temperature (AccT) and temperature at the site of origin are positively correlated with haemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, Daphnia from warmer climates upregulate haemoglobin much more strongly in response to AccT, suggesting local adaptation for plasticity in haemoglobin expression. Our results show that both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to temperature tolerance, and elucidate a possible role of haemoglobin in mediating these effects that differs along a cold-warm gradient.

TI  - Viability of thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle for the next generation nuclear reactor: Issues and prospects
VL  - 97
SP  - 259-275
AB  - This paper presented a review on the past, present and the future of thorium fuel cycle. The aim of this study is to evaluate the developments in thorium fuel cycle, looking at the prospects and drawbacks on the possibility of thorium-based nuclear fuel for commercial reactors realising the increasing challenges of uranium-based nuclear fuel. The initial interest on thorium-based nuclear fuel and why it was abandoned at the early stage of nuclear technology were considered. Also, the reasons behind the present renewed interest on the viability of thorium fuel cycle as a valuable alternative to the conventional uranium-based fuel were studied. Thorium abundance, its physical, chemical and neutronic properties were evaluated in comparison to the uranium fuel cycle to determine thorium fuel sustainability for next generation nuclear industry. In this study, it was found that thorium fuel is three to four times more abundant, has higher conductivity, high melting temperature, low expansivity and more proliferation resistant compared to uranium fuel. The possible application and related challenges of thorium fuels in different reactor types and designs such as light water reactors (LWRs), high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), heavy water reactors (HWRs), molten salt reactors (MSRs) and accelerator driven system reactors (ADSRs) were reviewed. The findings indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in the currently dominant LWRs designs in the nuclear industry with little technical modification, and also in other reactor types under investigation for future application especially molten salt breeder reactors, fast reactors and accelerator driven system reactors. Finally, this review made some recommendations on the short-term and long-term applications of thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle, and the issues that must be addressed before using thorium fuel for commercial reactor operations.

TI  - A novel integrated system for sustainable generation of hydrogen and liquid hydrocarbon fuels using the five-step ZnSI thermochemical cycle, biogas upgrading process, and solar collectors
VL  - 312
AB  - The utilization of renewable energy sources such as solar energy and biogas have recently received more attention due to a decline in fossil energy sources and environmental issues. A leading method for long-term renewable energies sources storage is to convert to fuels such as hydrogen and heavy value hydrocarbons. In this work, a novel integrated structure is developed for sustainable cogeneration of hydrogen and heavy liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This integrated structure consists of the zinc-sulfur-iodine thermochemical cycle, biogas treatment cycle, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactions, a carbon dioxide power generation, and solar dish collectors. It is demonstrated that this integrated structure produces 359.8 kmol/h hydrogen, 116.8 kmol/h liquid fuels, 1714 kmol/h carbon monoxide, and 289,149 kmol/h hot water. The thermal energy and exergy efficiencies of the integrated structure are 58.03% and 44.34%, respectively. The exergy analysis illustrates that exergy destruction mostly occurs in heat exchangers (36.67%), reactors (24.69%), and collectors (20.25%). The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the absorbed useful energy and solar collector thermal efficiency decrease up to 9.735 kW and 0.7751, respectively when the average operating wall temperature in each solar collector increases from 627 degrees C to 1127 degrees C. The thermal efficiency and productivity of the liquid fuels increase up to 0.63 and 383.6 kmol/h, respectively with increase of carbon dioxide composition in the biogas from 40 mol% to 55 mol%.

VL  - 10

AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is becoming a valuable model for investigating antiviral defense in the Lophotrochozoa superphylum. In the past five years, improvements to laboratory-based experimental infection protocols using Ostreid herpesvirus I (OsHV-1) from naturally infected C. gigas combined with next-generation sequencing techniques has revealed that oysters have a complex antiviral response involving the activation of all major innate immune pathways. Experimental evidence indicates C. gigas utilizes an interferon-like response to limit OsHV-1 replication and spread. Oysters injected with a viral mimic (polyI:C) develop resistance to OsHV-1. Improved survival following polyI: C injection was found later in life (within-generational immune priming) and in the next generation (multi-generational immune priming). These studies indicate that the oyster's antiviral defense system exhibits a form of innate immune-memory. An important priority is to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. This knowledge will motivate the development of practical and cost-effective treatments for improving oyster health in aquaculture.

TI  - Next Gen Laser Assisted Bonding (LAB) Technology
SP  - 1991-1995
AB  - There are several chip to substrate interconnection technologies in the packaging tool kit such as mass reflow (MR), thermocompression bonding (TCB) and laser assisted bonding (LAB). MR is a mature process but has known limitations on fine pitch devices and large/thin substrate packages. TCB has the advantage to minimize bump stress for low-K dielectric devices but its productiviy is very low. However, LAB can provide a solution for advanced devices with its localized heating and short bonding time. Recently, demand for fine-pitch Flip Chip bumps and large/thin substrate packages has increased, resulting in industry interest in LAB due to its good quality and high productivity. Amkor Technology invented LAB technology in 2014 and passed qualification for multiple devices from customers through many years of development and has been in high volume production for major customers since 2018. However, as the industry continues to require high bonding performance with various new devices, existing LAB technology may not support all these applications. These devices have led to the development of Next Gen LAB technology with a new bonding concept. One of devices that requires Next Gen LAB will be back side metallization (BSM) dies. BSM dies are necessary for Metal thermal interface material (TIM) applications for high thermal performance packages. In this study, new LAB technology is introduced, and its performance is compared with existing LAB with BSM die bump using large body FCBGA package. We focused on infrared (IR) temperature, X-ray inspection and cross-sectional anaysis to verify bump interconnection quality. Good bump quality was achieved with Next Gen LAB technology. This allows it to be another solution for next generation devices in the near future.

Important applications of whole-body human thermal models are predicting comfort under various conditions, such as riding in an air-conditioned automobile on a hot day, and predicting the probability of survival under life-threatening conditions, such as accidental immersion is cold water. This paper is arranged in three parts. In the first part, the evolution of human thermal models is discussed.

TI  - Sources of inefficient power generation by coal-fired thermal power plants in China: A metafrontier DEA decomposition approach
VL  - 138
AB  - China is the world's largest CO2 emitting country, and coal-fired thermal power generation accounted for over 50% of the total electricity generation in China in 2015. This study reports the changes in the power generation efficiency of coal-fired thermal power plants in China from 2009 to 2011 and elucidates how the differences in the production scale of the power plants and regional heterogeneity affect the power generation efficiency. We propose a metafrontier data envelopment analysis (DEA) decomposition framework to investigate the sources of inefficiency in power generation. The results suggest that, on average, the power generation efficiency of largescale power plants is 13% higher than that of small-scale power plants. Although operational inefficiency is the main source of inefficiency in eastern and central China, the technology gap the differences in the quality of coal consumed for electricity production and in the equipment of the power plants among regions is the main source of inefficiency in western China. This study uses the results of the framework to discuss the scrapping policies for coal-fired thermal power plants in China. For large-scale power plants in western China, the components of inefficiency vary and, thus, policymakers should consider scrapping thermal power plants based not only on the level of inefficiency but also on their components.

VL  - 3

SP  - 989-995
AB  - Ocean temperatures will increase significantly over the next 100 years due to global climate change(1). As temperatures increase beyond current ranges, it is unclear how adaptation will impact the distribution and ecological role of marine microorganisms(2). To address this major unknown, we imposed a stressful high-temperature regime for 500 generations on a strain from the abundant marine Roseobacter Glade. High-temperature-adapted isolates significantly improved their fitness but also increased biofilm formation at the air-liquid interface. Furthermore, this altered lifestyle was coupled with genomic changes linked to biofilm formation in individual isolates, and was also dominant in evolved populations. We hypothesize that the increasing biofilm formation was driven by lower oxygen availability at elevated temperature, and we observe a relative fitness increase at lower oxygen. The response is uniquely different from that of Escherichia coli adapted to high temperature(3 )(only 3% of mutated genes were shared in both studies). Thus, future increased temperatures could have a direct effect on organismal physiology and an indirect effect via a decrease in ocean oxygen solubility, leading to an alteration in microbial lifestyle.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of market restructuring initiatives that introduced competition into the United States electricity industry on the thermal efficiency of electricity generation. An empirical model is estimated on annual data for over 950 plants from 1996 to 2006. Model estimates show that access to wholesale electricity markets and retail choice together increased the efficiency of investor-owned plants by about nine percent and that these gains stem from organizational and technological changes within the plant. Although not directly targeted by restructuring initiatives, similar efficiency gains are also found for municipality-owned plants. This result suggests that the potential benefits from competition have spilled over to public electricity generation.

TI  - Predicting the current and future distribution of the edible long-horned grasshopper Ruspolia differens (Serville) using temperature-dependent phenology models
VL  - 95
AB  - The edible long-horned grasshopper Ruspolia differens (Serville) is widely distributed and consumed in subSaharan Africa. Efficient mass rearing of the edible grasshopper is critical to ensure their sustainable supply for food and nutritional security. Hence, we investigated the effect of temperature on development, survival and reproduction of R. differens under six constant (15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures. Using Insect Life Cycle Modeling software we fitted, linear and non-linear models to R. differens development, mortality, longevity, and fecundity. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. We used the process-based climatic phenology models, and applied establishment risk index (ERI) and generation index (GI) in a geographic information system to map the potential distribution of R. differens under current and future climates. At optimum temperatures of 30-32 degrees C, egg incubation period was 14-15 days and the developmental time was shortest at 52.5-58 days. Lowest nymphal mortality (3.4-13%) and the highest female fecundity was obtained at 25-30 degrees C. The optimum temperature for the reproduction ranged between 27 and 30 degrees C. Most simulated lifetable parameters were at their maximum at 28 degrees C. Predictive models showed that countries in the East, Central, West, Southern and the Horn of Africa were suitable for establishment of R. differens under current climate scenarios (2000). However, by 2050, climatically suitable areas for the establishment of R. differens were predicted to shrink in the West, Southern and the Horn of Africa than its current distribution. We predict up to three generations per year for R. differens in sub-Saharan Africa under current scenarios which can increase to 4 under future scenarios. The optimum rearing temperatures identified can guide optimization of mass rearing of R. differens.

AB  - Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is technology that can significantly increase the share of renewable energy in final energy supply and are one of essential technologies for the nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB), new build and refurbished. In the article (a) an experimental semitransparent BIPV glazed facade structure with 60% of PV cell coverage is shown; (b) energy efficiency indicators were developed based on identified impact parameters using experimental data; and (c) multi-parametric models of electricity generation, preheating of air for space ventilation, and dynamic thermal insulation features that enable prediction of solar energy utilization in different climate conditions are shown. The modeled efficiency of electricity production of BIPV was in the range between 8% and 9.5% at daily solar radiation above 1500 Wh/day, while low impact of outdoor air temperature and ventilation air flow rate on PV cell cooling was noticed. Between 35% and 75% of daily solar radiation can be utilized by preheating the air for space ventilation, and 4.5% to 7.5% of daily solar radiation can be utilized in the form of heat gains through opaque envelope walls.

AB  - In this study, a modified heat transfer search (MHTS) algorithm is proposed by incorporating sub-population based simultaneous heat transfer modes viz. conduction, convection, and radiation in the basic HTS algorithm. However, the basic HTS algorithm considers only one of the modes of heat transfer for each generation. The multiple natural frequency constraints in truss optimization problems can improve the dynamic behavior of the structure and prevent undesirable vibrations. However, shape and size variables subjected to frequency constraints are difficult to handle due to the complexity of its feasible region, which is non-linear, non-convex, implicit, and often converging to the local optimal solution. The viability and effectiveness of the HTS and MHTS algorithms are investigated by six standard trusses problems. The solutions illustrate that the MHTS algorithm performs better than the HTS algorithm.

It is shown that the resistivity of the undoped 6H-SiC varies strongly, with the ambient temperature following a temperature/field function dominated by an exponential factor containing the activation (ionization) energy of residual boron of 0.35 eV. The dominant activation energy of semi-insulating Vanadium-compensated material (6H-SiC:V) varies with the ambient temperature, increasing from approx. 0 eV at 295-320 K to approx. 0.8 eV at T > 600 K. This result can explain the viability of insulating 6H-SiC as a substrate for next-generation high temperature power microwave integrated circuits based on large bandgap semiconductors.

TI  - Corrosion mechanisms of ferritic-martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel-based alloy in molten chlorides. Part I: NaCl-KC1 binary system
VL  - 215
AB  - With suitable thermophysical properties and commercial viability, molten chlorides are promising candidates to replace nitrate salts as heat transfer fluids (HTF) and thermal energy storage (TES) materials for next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Nevertheless, structural materials including steels and nickel-based alloys experience severe corrosion in molten chlorides. The explicit understanding of the corrosion mechanisms is therefore decisive in order to propose viable technical solutions to increase the durability of these materials. In this work, the corrosion behavior of ferritic-martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel-based alloy is investigated in molten NaCI-KCI at 700 degrees C under Ar. The salt mixtures after exposure as well as the corroded samples were simultaneously characterized. The systematic metallographic study after the water-free preparation indicates that electrochemical processes play a major role in the overall corrosion mechanisms. In both P91 steel and Inconel 600, the formation of micro-galvanic pairs between Cr-rich phases (anodic sites) and the alloy matrix (cathode) leads to the selective dissolution of Cr from the alloys resulting in the formation of subsurface voids. The influence of O-2 and of various alloying elements on the corrosion kinetics is discussed. Based on the experimental observations, several corrosion mechanisms combining electrochemical reactions, solid-state diffusion and chloridation-oxidation processes have to be taken into account.

AB  - An accelerator-driven thermal neutron facility for boron neutron capture therapy of skin melanoma is currently under construction at the Legnaro, National Laboratories, Italy. The installation relies on the production of neutrons from a thick beryllium target bombarded with 5 MeV protons. A complete set of double differential data, i.e. angle- and energy-differential neutron spectra produced by the beryllium target, is necessary for the Monte Carlo-based design of the installation. For this purpose, double differential fluence measurements are currently performed with the "BINS" neutron spectrometer using 5 MeV protons at the "CN" Van de Graaf accelerator. This spectrometer uses a superheated emulsion of dichlorotetrafluoroethane which is sequentially operated at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 degrees C and thus provides a series of seven sharp thresholds covering the 0.1-10 MeV neutron energy interval. Deconvolution of the data is performed with the code "MAXED", which is based on the maximum entropy principle. The analysis of our first neutron spectrometry measurements at angles of 0 degrees, 40 degrees, 80 degrees and 120 degrees supports the viability of the BINS spectrometry method for the generation of the required double differential data.

TI  - Acute and chronic toxicity assessments of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on the calanoid copepod Acartia clausi: Effects on survival, development, sex-ratio and reproduction
VL  - 807
AB  - Estrogens, such as the 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and the 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), have been regarded as a global threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their pseudo-persistence, their high estrogenic activity and their toxicity towards non-target species. Data regarding their ecotoxicological effects on marine calanoid copepods are very scarce. In this study, the calanoid copepod Acartia clausi was used as a model organism for estrogens exposure in marine pelagic ecosystems. Lethal effects of estrogens on A. clausi life-stages (Embryos, one day old nauplii: N1, three day old nauplii: N3, copepodites: C1-C3 and adults: C6) were investigated using 48 h acute tests. Copepods showed stage-specific responses against E2 and EE2 acute exposure. The most resistant life stage was N1 with LC50 values > 1500 mu g L-1 and >5000 mu g L-1, respectively for E2 and EE2. For N3, C1-C3, and C6, sensitivity to estrogens decreased with age and survival was affected at concentrations above those detected in the environment reflecting low estrogens acute toxicity for these life stages. In contrast, embryonic stage revealed high vulnerability to E2 and EE2 acute effects. Embryos showed non-monotonic dose-response and hatching success was significantly reduced at low realistic concentrations of E2 (0.005, 0.5, and 5 mu g L-1) and EE2 (0.05 and 5 mu g L-1). Survival, development and sex ratio of A. clausi to EE2 exposure at 1 and 100 mu g L-1 were also determined during a life cycle experiment. Fitness of the females of the generation F0 was evaluated by measuring lifespan, prosome length and egg production. The main observed effects were the decrease of females' prosome length, the feminization of the population and the reduction of the egg production for the generation F0 at 100 mu g L-1 of EE2. This concentration is above those reported in the environment indicating the tolerance of A. clausi to EE2 at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the most recent years, among the different forms of renewable energy sources, biomass is playing an important role in the strategic agenda of European Community. Many countries, including Italy, have introduced important incentive schemes to support the use of biomass for electricity, heat and transportation. This has raised considerable interest towards the use of biomass for energy production. Nonetheless, the investment on biomass fuelled power plants presents several critical issues, such as choice of feedstock composition, economic viability with regard to plant size, access to locally available biomass and price of feedstock. This case study attempts at an evaluation of the economies originated by a small scale (<1 MWel) Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine coupled with a biomass fuelled boiler, fed by residual biomass from local cultivations, located in a rural area of a typical Mediterranean semi-arid environment in inland Sicily. A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used as a tool to assess the power plant economic viability with respect to local biomass availability and localization. Plant financial viability was evaluated for a number of different scenarios based on power plant size, number of yearly operational hours, feedstock mix and price. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 14

SP  - 267-279
AB  - Solar aided feedwater heating (SAFWH) appears to be a prospective option for using solar thermal energy in existing or new coal-fired thermal power plants. This article deals with the 4-E (namely energy, exergy, environment, and economic) analysis of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants to establish their techno-economic viability. An operating coal-fired subcritical (SubC) and the first supercritical (SupC) power plant being commissioned in India are considered as reference power plants for SAFWH. The 4-E analysis is reported assuming operation of coal-fired power plants with SAFWH for 8 h/day in either fuel conservation or power boosting mode. An instantaneous reduction of about 14-19% in coal consumption is observed by substituting turbine bleed streams to all the feedwater heaters including deaerator with SAFWH in "fuel conservation mode". The substitution of turbine bleed stream to high pressure feedwater heater alone with SAFWH results in about 5-6% instantaneous improvement in coal consumption and additional power generation for the fuel conservation and power boosting modes, respectively compared with the same values in reference power plants. The annual savings in fuel cost alone correspond to Indian Rupee (INR) 73.5-74.5 millions. The performance of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants is also measured in terms of energy and exergy performance index and it is observed that the utilization of solar energy for feedwater heating is more efficient based on exergy rather than energy. The environmental analysis shows that about 62,000 and 65,000 t of CO2 are reduced annually from 500 MWe SubC and 660 MWe SupC coal-fired power plants, respectively using the best possible SAFWH option. However, the cost/tonne of CO2 avoided is about 7775-8885 and 8395-9790 INR (similar to 200 USD) for solar thermal aided coal-fired SubC and SupC power plants, respectively far higher than the most mitigation measures under consideration today. Furthermore, SAFWH is found to be a not very cost effective measure based on the cost of saved fuel (coal). (C) 2010 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - Solar energy is becoming a promising source of heat and power for electrical generation and desalination plants. In this work, an integrated study of modeling, optimization, and experimental work is undertaken for a parabolic trough concentrator combined with a humidification and dehumidification desalination unit. The objective is to study the design performance and economic feasibility of a solar-driven desalination system. The design involves the circulation of a closed loop of synthetic blend motor oil in the concentrators and the desalination unit heat input section. The air circulation in the humidification and dehumidification unit operates in a closed loop, where the circulating water runs during the daytime and requires only makeup feed water to maintain the humidifier water level. Energy losses are reduced by minimizing the waste of treated streams. The process is environmentally friendly, since no significant chemical treatment is required. Design, construction, and operation are performed, and the system is analyzed at different circulating oil and air flow rates to obtain the optimum operating conditions. A case study in Saudi Arabia is carried out. The study reveals unit capability of producing 24.31 kg/day at a circulating air rate of 0.0631 kg/s and oil circulation rate of 0.0983 kg/s. The tradeoff between productivity, gain output ratio, and production cost revealed a unit cost of 12.54 US$/m(3). The impact of the circulating water temperature has been tracked and shown to positively influence the process productivity. At a high productivity rate, the humidifier efficiency was found to be 69.1%, and the thermal efficiency was determined to be 82.94%. The efficiency of the parabolic trough collectors improved with the closed loop oil circulation, and the highest performance was achieved from noon until 14:00 p.m.

SP  - 39-43
AB  - Environmental problems in urban areas cause a decline in life quality. It is well-known that working in a place where people feel peaceful and comfortable affects productivity positively. Urban green areas and plantation ecosystems have great importance for more healthy generations. The city of Erzurum is located at 1850-2000 m altitude on a dish-like topography. The number and diversity of plant species are limited because of the great difference between day-time and night temperatures as a typical characteristic of the continental climate. The main goal of this study was to assess commonly used Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations with different densities and ages on urban thermal comfort. This study was carried at four different Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations established on the same altitude during July, August and September 2016. The measurements were taken between 12:00-14:00 h, at which the air temperature is at its maximum, as an average of at least six different measurement points at each plantation site. The results indicated that air temperature was lower at least 3.4-5.2 degrees C in different plantation sites as compared to that of the city. The effects of Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations on thermal comfort were evaluated based upon differences in plant ages and plantation spaces. Suggestions on more livable urban design and planning for thermal comfort were also offered for city planners.

TI  - Binary grey wolf optimizer models for profit based unit commitment of price-taking GENCO in electricity market
VL  - 44
SP  - 957-971
AB  - The restructuration of electric power sector has renovated the power system operational planning. In the deregulated market, electricity is treated as an entity unlike in the traditional vertically integrated market model where it is treated as a service provided by the generation companies (GENCOs). The task of GENCO is to perform self-scheduling of available units so as to achieve maximum profit in restructured power sector. Therefore, the problem of profit based unit commitment (PBUC) in deregulated markets can be formulated as a commitment and generation allocation through self-scheduling procedure. The commitment schedule optimization, i.e whether the status of a thermal unit is to be changed to on or off state, is a binary problem. Thus, the PBUC problem requires binary optimization for commitment and real valued optimization for generation allocation. In this paper, three binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO) models are presented to solve the profit based self-scheduling problem of GENCO. The BGWO models proposed in this paper differ with respect to the transformation function used to map real valued wolf position into a binary variable. The binary mapping of commitment status is carried out using sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic transfer functions. Also, in the sigmoidal transfer function, two binary transformation procedures, namely crossover and conventional sigmoidal transfer function, are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed models in improving the solution quality of PBUC problem is examined using two test systems, a 3 unit and a 10 unit test system. In addition, two cases of GENCO market participation with and without reserve market participation are simulated. In the test case with reserve market participation, two commonly used reserve payment models are examined. Simulation results are presented and compared to existing approaches that have been used to solve the PBUC problem. The simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the improved solution quality (profit or fitness value) of the PBUC problem and statistical significance of the BGWO models with respect to solution quality obtained as compared to other established meta-heuristic approaches.

VL  - 104

SP  - 1286-1293
AB  - The developmental thresholds for Marmara gulosa Guillen & Davis (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) were investigated in the laboratory by using 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 degrees C. The lowest mortality occurred in cohorts exposed to 25 and 29 degrees C. Other temperatures caused > 10% mortality primarily in egg and first and second instar sap-feeding larvae. Linear regression analysis approximated the lower developmental threshold at 12.2 degrees C. High mortality and slow developmental rate at 33 degrees C indicate the upper developmental threshold is near this temperature. The degree-day (DD) model indicated that a generation requires an accumulation of 322 DD for development from egg to adult emergence. Average daily temperatures in the San Joaquin Valley could produce up to seven generations of M. gulosa per year. Field studies documented two, five, and three overlapping generations of M. gulosa in walnuts (Juglans regia L.; Juglandaceae), pummelos (Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr.; Rutaceae), and oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck; Rutaceae), for a total of seven observed peelminer generations. Degree-day units between generations averaged 375 DD for larvae infesting walnut twigs; however, availability of green wood probably affected timing of infestations. Degree-day units between larval generations averaged 322 for pummelos and 309 for oranges, confirming the laboratory estimation. First infestation of citrus occurred in June in pummelo fruit and August in orange fruit when fruit neared 60 mm in diameter. Fruit size and degree-day units could be used as management tools to more precisely time insecticide treatments to target the egg stage and prevent rind damage to citrus. Degree-day units also could be used to more precisely time natural enemy releases to target larval instars that are preferred for oviposition.

VL  - 114

SP  - 2421-2427
AB  - Scale-up criteria of laser ablation in the liquid phase with nanosecond pulses is studied for efficient generation of pure ceramic nanoparticles in an aqueous environment. Besides high laser fluence and low height of the applied liquid layer, specific pulse overlap and defined laser repetition rate are required for significant enhancement in nanoparticle productivity. The ablation rate increases by 350% by reducing the liquid film from 8 mm to 2.5 mm owing to reduced absorption and scattering of the incident laser beam by previously ablated nanoparticles. The controlled interpulse distance yields a further increase in material removal rate by another 300% compared to machining in the pulse overlap mode. The residual cavitation bubble from the previous laser pulse and the dispersed nanoparticle interaction with the following laser pulse and optimized temperature gradient in the lattice of the target are assumed to alter productivity. This hypothesis is confirmed by varying the repetition rate with equal laser fluence and pulse overlap, which causes a drastic rise in nanoparticle productivity by a factor of 65. A maximum corundum nanoparticle productivity of 1.3 g/h with Feret particle size of 30 nm is gained by 18.5 W of focused laser power at 4 kHz of repetition rate, providing 125 mu m interpulse distance and liquid flow.

SP  - 339-350
AB  - An effective method for the synthesis of photochromic diarylethenes through the generation of heteroaryllithiums and subsequent reaction with octafluorocyclopentene has been developed by using integrated flow microreactor systems. Reactions can be conducted without using cryogenic conditions by virtue of effective temperature and residence time control, although much lower temperatures (<-78?degrees C) are needed for batch macroreactions. Moreover, the synthesis of unsymmetrical diarylethenes, which is difficult to achieve when using conventional batch macrosystems, has been accomplished based on the selective introduction of one aryl group to give arylheptafluorocyclopentene followed by the introduction of another aryl group. The productivity of the laboratory-scale system is approximately 0.5 mmol?min-1. Therefore, the present integrated flow microreactor method serves as a practical way of synthesizing various photochromic diarylethene derivatives.

VL  - 66

SP  - 665-677
AB  - Natural and sexual selection are classically thought to oppose one another, and although there is evidence for this, direct experimental demonstrations of this antagonism are largely lacking. Here, we assessed the effects of sexual and natural selection on the evolution of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a character subject to both modes of selection, in Drosophila simulans. Natural selection and sexual selection were manipulated in a fully factorial design, and after 27 generations of experimental evolution, the responses of male and female CHCs were assessed. The effects of natural and sexual selection differed greatly across the sexes. The responses of female CHCs were generally small, but CHCs evolved predominantly in the direction of natural selection. For males, profiles evolved via sexual and natural selection, as well as through the interaction between the two, with some male CHC components only evolving in the direction of natural selection when sexual selection was relaxed. These results indicate sex-specific responses to selection, and that sexual and natural selection act antagonistically for at least some combinations of CHCs.

TI  - Females of the weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus manipulate the size and number of eggs according to the host seed availability
VL  - 34
IS  - 3
SP  - 246-250
AB  - In some insects, the finding of oviposition substrate triggers the uptake into oocytes of yolk proteins that are stored in the fat body during post-embryonic development. The main host of the bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus (Coleoptera; Chrysomelidae; Bruchinae; Amblycerini), in which larval resources are the sole source for future egg maturation, is Phaseolus vulgaris. Despite not feeding as adults, females of this species are able to lay eggs after encountering host seeds but it is not known how females react to changes in the availability of bean seeds. In the present study, the behaviour of Z. subfasciatus facing two very different environments for oviposition is investigated, as well as how this influences offspring fitness. The results obtained show that females of Z. subfasciatus react to variations in the availability of seeds belonging to the same host species by adjusting egg size and number. Females on low bean seed density lay larger and fewer eggs than those on high bean seed density, demonstrating a trade-off between these reproductive traits. Moreover, females can adjust egg size to changing levels of host availability during the first 4 days of their oviposition period. Although no difference in offspring weight is found, those from small eggs (low competition environment) result in larger adults. No response to selection on these traits after rearing beetles on the same host for 40 generations is observed. This unresponsiveness may indicate that beetle populations behave according to their reaction norm that already allows rapid adaptation to a varying amount of host-seed availability and better exploitation of the environments of this widespread stored-seed pest.

AB  - In this paper the fmancial viability of a novel storage concept, referred to as 'integrated pumped-heat-electricity storage', is assessed for both a coal-fired and a combined cycle (CC) power plant located in Germany, as well as for a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant located in Spain. The rationale of this concept is to use electricity during times of cheap wholesale market prices, e.g. stemming from a high supply of renewable energies, in order to generate thermal energy via a heat pump, since thermal energy can be stored at comparatively low cost. If the electricity demand rises again, the stored thermal energy is used to power a conventional water-steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of fossil fuels used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP plant. A mixed integer linear program, considering the day-ahead wholesale market electricity prices and remunerations of offering tertiary control power in Germany, is employed to fmd an approximation of the optimal schedule for the generation in the power plant as well as for the purchase and the sale of electricity. The fmancial viability is assessed using net present value (NPV) and real options analysis. Storing electricity to profit from temporal arbitrage is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively estimated) costs of thermal storage units are still too high. The largest part of the revenues stems from the remunerations of offering tertiary control power. Therefore, while the utilization of heat pumps, which are estimated to have rather high costs, is not profitable, employing electric heaters without storage units is found to be economically viable for a coalfired and a CC power plant in Germany. Here, NPV and real options analysis yield the same result, i.e. to invest immediately in such an application. In Spain, offering tertiary control power is presently not remunerated, but only the call-offs of tertiary control energy, which are not considered in the mixed integer linear program. Consequently, employing electric heaters in CSP plants in Spain is found to be not financially viable either. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Scotland's onshore wind energy generation, impact on natural capital & satisfying no-nuclear energy policy
VL  - 7
SP  - 7106-7117
AB  - Onshore wind electricity generation is key to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Poorly sited wind farms degrade high carbon soils and habitats, diminishing overall emission reductions. We explore the viability of the Scottish Government's renewable energy plan with respect to land use, natural capital and low carbon storage. With avoidance of sensitive peatlands a main consideration, six constraining factors were combined to determine areas of least habitat and soil sensitivity to onshore wind development in Scotland. Currently, 14 out of 21 terrestrial habitats have been impacted by installation of 389 onshore wind sites. Accounting for 73% of the total area, Coniferous Woodland, Acid Grassland, Bog, and Heather Grassland have been the largest habitats impacted. The most common soils of the least sensitive areas available for installation are brown earth and podzols, and construction of new wind farms on environmentally sensitive areas can be minimised by targeting relatively disturbed habitats such as improved grasslands. Scotland has a potential of 2.75 Mha of relatively low sensitive land, the largest areas sited in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Aberdeenshire. Additional to current installed capacity (13.9 GW), Scotland would require 6.6 GW of installed onshore wind capacity to function without nuclear energy generation and 464 GWh additional storage capacity (provided by 8.2 GW wind capacity). This equates to an installed and additional total of 346.676 ha required for wind electricity generation, potentially satisfied by shared land use with 23% of Scottish improved grasslands. Scotland has the available land area to achieve the Scottish Government's policy to move towards carbon-neutral, nuclear-free electricity generation through the use of renewables alone. Questions remain on which source of low carbon dispatchable (immediately accessible) energy to use in the case of a several day wind lull. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Modularity Facilitates Flexible Tuning of Plastic and Evolutionary Gene Expression Responses during Early Divergence
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 77-93
AB  - Gene expression changes have been recognized as important drivers of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Little is known about the relative roles of plastic and evolutionary responses in complex gene expression networks during the early stages of divergence. Large gene expression data sets coupled with in silico methods for identifying coexpressed modules now enable systems genetics approaches also in nonmodel species for better understanding of gene expression responses during early divergence. Here, we combined gene coexpression analyses with population genetics to separate plastic and population (evolutionary) effects in expression networks using small salmonid populations as a model system. We show that plastic and population effects were highly variable among the six identified modules and that the plastic effects explained larger proportion of the total eigengene expression than population effects. A more detailed analysis of the population effects using a Q(ST)-F-ST comparison across 16,622 annotated transcripts revealed that gene expression followed neutral expectations within modules and at the global level. Furthermore, two modules showed enrichment for genes coding for early developmental traits that have been previously identified as important phenotypic traits in thermal responses in the same model system indicating that coexpression analysis can capture expression patterns underlying ecologically important traits. We suggest that module-specific responses may facilitate the flexible tuning of expression levels to local thermal conditions. Overall, our study indicates that plasticity and neutral evolution are the main drivers of gene expression variance in the early stages of thermal adaptation in this system.

TI  - Footprints of selection in wild populations of Bicyclus anynana along a latitudinal cline
VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SP  - 341-353
AB  - One of the major questions in ecology and evolutionary biology is how variation in the genome enables species to adapt to divergent environments. Here, we study footprints of thermal selection in candidate genes in six wild populations of the afrotropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana sampled along a c. 3000 km latitudinal cline. We sequenced coding regions of 31 selected genes with known functions in metabolism, pigment production, development and heat shock responses. These include genes for which we expect a priori a role in thermal adaptation and, thus, varying selection pressures along a latitudinal cline, and genes we do not expect to vary clinally and can be used as controls. We identified amino acid substitution polymorphisms in 13 genes and tested these for clinal variation by correlation analysis of allele frequencies with latitude. In addition, we used two FST-based outlier methods to identify loci with higher population differentiation than expected under neutral evolution, while accounting for potentially confounding effects of population structure and demographic history. Two metabolic enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, UGP and Treh, showed clinal variation. The same loci showed elevated population differentiation and were identified as significant outliers. We found no evidence of clines in the pigmentation genes, heat shock proteins and developmental genes. However, we identified outlier loci in more localized parts of the range in the pigmentation genes yellow and black. We discuss that the observed clinal variation and elevated population divergence in UGP and Treh may reflect adaptation to a geographic thermal gradient.

VL  - 66

SP  - 1702-1709
AB  - Experiments were undertaken to study the combined effects of environmental (prey concentration and photoperiod) and genetic (parental spawning season) factors on growth and survival of herring larvae. During the experimental period, constant prey concentrations were maintained at one of the two nominal levels, under either a spring or an autumn light regime. Eggs of one autumn-spawning North Sea Buchan female herring were fertilized either with cryopreserved sperm from three Norwegian spring-spawning males or with fresh sperm from three Buchan males. Larvae of the two groups (the hybrids marked with alizarin) were mixed in replicated treatment tanks, thus ensuring identical environmental conditions. Mean larval growth rates were mostly influenced by food availability, but the hybrids grew significantly faster than the pure autumn-spawned offspring. In addition, the hybrids experienced a survival advantage at low prey concentrations. Hybrid survival was also somewhat better at high prey concentrations under a spring photoperiod than the corresponding group under an autumn photoperiod, suggesting a possible genetic adaptation to seasonal light conditions. The experiment documents the viability beyond first-feeding of offspring from parents with different spawning periods. The results are discussed in relation to herring metapopulation structure.

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis and cogeneration of a cement plant in India-A case study
AB  - In the present paper the thermodynamic analysis of a cement plant located in Barak Valley has been carried out. The analysis can be used as a precursor to achieve the basic objectives of any cement plant i.e. minimizing energy consumptions, minimizing the cost of production, and maximizing plant productivity. A simple model has been developed on the basis of mass and energy balance and has been applied to BVCL. The various performance parameters of the different components have been evaluated by making use of data collected over a year and First law efficiency of kiln system has been estimated. A heat recovery steam power plant has been proposed for the generation of electricity, which utilizes the waste heat of this plant. The capacity of the steam power plant has been estimated.

AB  - This paper is devoted to assess the possibility of using a hybrid wind/PV system for water pumping in Iraq. A hybrid wind/photovoltaic system was analyzed based on available wind speed records and annual solar radiation in Baghdad terminals, Iraq, as a case study. A small-scale hybrid wind/PV system is considered and modeled with an adapted to reveal the daily water discharge in terms of the operating conditions. To do so, a computer code written in MATLAB was built to simulate the performance of the proposed system. The system was tested on May 21, 2017, in Baghdad (33 degrees 33 ' N 44 degrees 44E). Effect of critical performance parameters such as well depth, ambient temperature, solar radiation intensity and wind turbine rotor configuration was reflected on productivity of the considered system.

AB  - In the field of Laser Additive Manufacturing, modern wire-based laser deposition techniques offer advantageous solutions for combining the high quality level of layer-by-layer fabrication of high value parts with the industry's economical requirements regarding productivity and energy efficiency. A newly developed coaxial wire head allows for omni-directional welding operation and, thus, the use of wire even for complex surface claddings as well as the generation of three-dimensional structures. Currently, several metallic alloys as steel, titanium, aluminium, and nickel are available for the generation of defect-free structures. Even cored wires containing carbide hardmetals can be used for the production of extra wear-resistant parts. Simultaneous heating of the wire using efficient electric energy increases significantly the deposition rate and energy efficiency. Examples of application are light-weight automotive parts, turbine blades of Nickel super alloys, and complex inserts of injection moulds.

AB  - The purpose of the research activities at the Skierniewice geothermal test site is to develop and apply an exploration methodology for low-enthalpy systems in sedimentary formations. Work included seismic and magnetotelluric surveys carried out close to well Kompina-2 to create a detailed structural-geologic model and characterize the anisotropic fracture system around the borehole. The study included the reprocessing of archival data from selected boreholes and 2D seismic lines. The collected data were used to identify formations with high fracture permeability and the presumed flow path of geothermal (similar to 110 degrees C) brine in high productivity zones, and determining rock porosities and salinity distribution in the subsurface. The next stage of the investigations will focus on siting a second borehole and studying the possibility of installing a plant for electrical generation or direct geothermal heat applications.

VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 415-429
AB  - Question: Does pond permanency affect life-history traits of endemic anurans from Patagonia? Background: Amphibians inhabiting North Patagonia breed at ponds that differ strongly in their water permanency. The role of phenotypic plasticity in adapting to variable environments could be fundamental in these Patagonian anurans. Prediction: In comparisons between populations and between species, we predicted that size at metamorphosis and developmental time of three endemic anurans from Patagonia are adaptive traits when these species are exposed to the selective pressure of pond drying. Organisms: Pleurodema thaul, Pleurodema bufoninum, and Rhinella spinulosa, the most common species of amphibians in North Patagonia, breed and develop in a gradient of environmental scenarios that include ponds with highly heterogeneous hydroperiods. Methods: We recorded age and size at metamorphosis of larvae and metamorphs in 15 natural ponds. To analyse the effect of hydroperiod on these traits, we performed common garden experiments by simulating two different water volumes (decreasing vs. constant). Results and conclusion: The anurans responded to the selective pressure of drying environments by reducing size and time to metamorphosis. These responses were also evident in laboratory experiments. Wetlands with shorter hydroperiods resulted in shorter larval periods and smaller metamorphs. Rhinella spinulosa developed faster in the decreasing water treatment, but its metamorphs did not differ in size between treatments. The two Pleurodema species also developed faster in the decreasing water treatment, and metamorphs reached smaller sizes in the decreasing water treatment. Pleurodema species showed strong evidence of adaptive significance of these traits based on comparisons between populations.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF FLOW REGIME ON THE SNOWY RIVER ESTUARY
AB  - The construction of the Snowy Mountain Hydro Scheme 1949 - 1974, has resulted in large inter-basin water transfer from the Snowy River to the Murray-Darling Basin, profoundly altering the biophysical condition of the river and its associated estuary and wetlands. The decline in health of the Snowy River system has led to the trial use of environmental water to improve river health. It is only by understanding outcomes of environmental flows, over the entirety of the system, that benefits of the watering scheme may be maximised. An extensive physical monitoring program of the entire estuary system was undertaken. This was coupled with the development of a detailed 3D hydrodynamic model capable of predicting effects of flow on selected water parameters (salinity, temperature and level) in the Snowy River estuary. The monitoring information was used to extend the calibration of the model to a wide range of flow, temperature and salinity conditions so that the model may be used to better determine outcomes of environmental flows on selected biota which use the estuary, either permanently or temporarily. As part of the project, the model was used to determine if suitable water parameters (salinity and temperature) exist within the Snowy River estuary to allow spawning of Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata, a catadromous native fish species. This information aided the development and implementation of the ecological monitoring part of the project. The ecological monitoring aspect on Australian bass was due to the species being comparatively common (within the catchment), having a life-history completed solely within the catchment (i.e. no known marine phase), a catadromous life-history influenced by flows, and due to it being an iconic target species for recreational anglers.

TI  - Quantifying population and clone-specific non-linear reaction norms to food gradients in Daphnia magna
VL  - 10
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is normally quantified as a reaction norm which details how trait expression changes across an environmental gradient. Sometime reaction norms are linear, but often reaction norms are assumed to be linear because plasticity is typically quantified as the difference in trait expression measured in two environments. This simplification limits how plastic responses vary between genotypes and may also bias the predictions of models investigating how plasticity influences a population's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Consequently, there is a pressing need to characterize the real shape of reaction norms and their genetic variability across ecologically relevant environmental gradients. To address this knowledge gap we measured the multi-trait plastic response of 7 Daphnia magna clones from the same population across a broad resource gradient. We used a Random Regression Mixed Model approach to characterize and quantify average and clone-specific responses to resource variation. Our results demonstrate that non-linear models outperformed a linear model for all 4 of the life-history traits we measured. The plastic reaction norms of all 4 traits were similar in shape and were often best described by a non-linear asymptotic model. Clonal variation in non-linear plastic responses was detectable for 3 out of the 4 traits that we measured although the nature and magnitude of variation across the resource gradient was trait-specific. We interpret our findings with respect to the impact that plasticity has on the evolutionary potential of a population in different resource environments.

SP  - 155-171
AB  - A multi-generational model of gypsy moth phenology was developed from existing literature and used to assess the risk of establishment of this exotic pest across North America based on the suitability of 4457 locations in satisfying the temperature requirements for seasonal development. Approximately 595 million hectares of North America is estimated to be climatically suitable for gypsy moth establishment. Limits to the potential range exist in the southern United States because of limits to diapause development, and in northern Canada because of slower prediapause and larval development. A 1.5 degreesC increase in mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as might occur with global climate change, would result in a range expansion in the north, a range contraction in the south, and a net increase in range of approximately 16%. The model is described and the probable limitations to establishment are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 17

SP  - 161-171
AB  - Next-generation sequencing techniques, such as RNA sequencing, have provided a wealth of genomic information for nonmodel species. Transcriptomic information can be used to quantify the patterns of gene expression, which can identify how environmental differences invoke organismal stress responses and provide a gauge in predicting species adaptability. In our study, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the first transcriptome from a naupliar tadpole shrimp (Triops newberryi) to identify the genes expressed during the early life history stages and which could be important for future genomic studies. RNA was extracted from naupliar T. newberryi that were reared in a laboratory-controlled setting and in two different water types, a native and a non-native condition. A total of six replicates, three per condition, were sequenced with the Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 achieving 365 M 50-nt reads. High-quality reads were produced and de novo assembly was used to construct a T. newberryi transcriptome that was approximately 24.8 M base pairs. More than 10 000 peptides were predicted from the assembly, and genes were sorted into gene ontology categories. The use of different water conditions allowed for a preliminary differential gene expression analysis in order to compare the changes in gene expression between conditions. There were 299 diff-erentially expressed genes between water conditions that might serve as a focal point for future genomic studies of Triops acclimation to different environments. The Triops transcriptome could serve as vital genomic information for additional studies on Branchiopod crustaceans.

AB  - In the present study, we used a 3D Coupled Ecosystem Model of Baltic Sea version 1 (3D CEMBSv1) coupled with a copepod model to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of two representative copepod populations in the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea) including Acartia spp. and Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus. The annual cycles simulated for 2000 under realistic weather and hydrographic conditions were studied with the three-dimensional version of the coupled ecosystem-copepod model in the south-eastern Baltic Sea. The paper presents the comparison of simulated and observed copepod development at two stations in the Gulf of Gdansk. A validation of influential state variables gives confidence that the model is able to calculate reliably the stage development of dominant species in the southern Baltic Sea. The number of generations was one for P. m. elongatus and 3-5 for Acartia spp.. A mean of five generations for the latter species per year were estimated in the coastal region and ca. three generations at the Gdansk Deep (in the open sea). Food concentration and temperature as the main factors controlling the development of the investigated copepods as well as salinity as a masking factor (i.e. salinity modifies the rate of their development) in the case of Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus are included in the present study.

AB  - Crustacean zooplankton form the keystone link between primary producers and fish stocks along the Norwegian shelf and in the southern part of the Barents Sea. We have established a multi-generation cultivation system for zooplankton in order to perform future experiments on the biological effects of drilling discharges from the offshore petroleum industry. A population of the cold-water species, Calanus finmarchicus, was collected in March 2004 and maintained in a static system of 100 1 polypropylene containers through all stages (Eggs-CVI). The population exhibited an average developmental time of 105 days which corresponds to realistic sub-Arctic to Arctic conditions (water temperatures= 5 degrees C (spring) and 8 degrees C (late summer)). A series of experiments was performed to examine copepod egg production as a function of different food sources and feeding concentrations. Only minor differences in egg production were observed for C. finmarchicus females fed with varying concentrations of the two diatom species Chaetoceros socialis and Thalassiosira weisflogii. In a separate experiment, the response to food availability was examined over time by tracking egg production and fecal pellet production (used as an indicator of food ingestion). Both hatching success and food ingestion were positively correlated with the food concentrations offered to adult females. Through this work we have demonstrated that C finmarchicus populations can be maintained in the laboratory through multiple generations. In addition, methods to control egg production through changes in food availability have been established making it feasible to control the start date of exposure experiments or the timing of the collection of eggs to initiate a new generation.

TI  - Experimental investigation of a multi-generation energy system for a nearly zero-energy park: A solution toward sustainable future
VL  - 200
AB  - In the current paper, the performance of a solar-based multi-generation system was experimentally investigated for one year. The system was composed of a photovoltaic section and a hybrid thermal and desalination section with a linear parabolic solar collector. Results indicate that besides entirely complies with the electricity, drinking water and hot water needs, utilization of the system for a nearly zero-energy park prevents 342 tons of CO2 net annual greenhouse gas emission. Furthermore, the performance of the linear parabolic solar collector was experimentally investigated and compared using both water and Al2O3-water nanofluid as the heat transfer fluids. Results show that using the nanofluid, a noticeable decrease (31%) in the total thermal loss coefficient led to a significant increase (70%) in the thermal efficiency of the system. Calculating the simple and equity paybacks, as well as the Internal Rate of Return, revealed the economic viability of the proposed multi-generation system. The capacity of the proposed system could be easily extended, and the pattern of the nearly zero-energy park in the current study could be applied in other urban areas to pursue a more sustainable future.

TI  - Distribution of the largest aftershocks in branching models of triggered seismicity: Theory of the universal Bath law
VL  - 71
IS  - 5
AB  - Using the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of generating probability functions to calculate exactly the average difference between the magnitude of a mainshock and the magnitude of its largest aftershock over all generations. This average magnitude difference is found empirically to be independent of the mainshock magnitude and equal to 1.2, a universal behavior known as Bath's law. Our theory shows that Bath's law holds only sufficiently close to the critical regime of the ETAS branching process. Allowing for error bars +/- 0.1 for Bath's constant value around 1.2, our exact analytical treatment of Bath's law provides new constraints on the productivity exponent alpha and the branching ratio n: 0.9 less than or similar to alpha <= 1 and 0.8 less than or similar to n <= 1. We propose a method for measuring alpha based on the predicted renormalization of the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of the magnitudes of the largest aftershock. We also introduce the "second Bath law for foreshocks:" the probability that a main earthquake turns out to be the foreshock does not depend on its magnitude rho.

TI  - Modeling predictive suitability to identify the potential of wind and solar energy as a driver of sustainable development in the Red Sea state, Sudan
VL  - 29
IS  - 29
SP  - 44233-44254
AB  - This paper investigated the potential and economic validity of wind and solar energy at 17 selected locations in the Red Sea state, Sudan, for the first time. To this aim, the NASA database was utilized. The results demonstrated that vertical axis wind turbines would be a good solution for electricity generation for building in the selected locations. Additionally, it is found that the chosen areas are suitable for installing photovoltaic (PV) systems due to the high-value solar radiation. Moreover, the economic viability of small-scale wind and PV systems for rooftop buildings in the selected regions is investigated. For a financial analysis of wind turbines, the performance of different characteristics of vertical axis winds was evaluated based on the determination of capacity factor and energy production cost. For the economic validity of installing PV systems, RETScreen Expert software was used. The results indicate that the annual production energy from wind turbines and solar power is within the range of 158.50-29,063.93kWh and 6648-15,533 kWh, respectively. This amount of energy output would reduce the effect of global warming and enhance the sustainable technological development of the country. Moreover, the results indicate that model#9 (Vertical Axis Wind Generator-V) with a capacity of 5 kW has the lowest cost value (0.08703-0.01025 $/kWh) compared to the other selected turbines for the studied locations. Besides, the average energy production cost is within the range of 0.036-0.049 $/kWh for PV systems. In the end, it is concluded that using small-scale renewable energy systems will help reduce the electricity bills and the dependency on fossil fuels, the effect of global warming, and enhance the country's sustainable technological development.

VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 57-66
AB  - The supercooling point (SCP) and lower lethal temperature (LLT50) of male adult Diamesa mendotae Muttkowski (Diptera: Chironomidae) were determined from field-collected individuals. SCP determined using surface-contact thermometry did not differ statistically from previously reported values for a previous generation of this species. The LLT50 was determined by exposing individuals to -10, -15, -20, -25, and -30 degrees C for one minute. Mean survivorship was 96.7, 91.2, and 71.2% for tests at -10, -15, and -20 degrees C, respectively. Exposure to -25 and -30 degrees C resulted in 100% mortality in all tests. Results show that males of D. mendotae are freeze-intolerant with a mean SCP of -21.6 degrees C which is only 0.1 degrees C lower than its linear interpolated estimated LLT 50 of -21.5 degrees C. Our results confirm that a low SCP, rather than freeze tolerance, is a mechanism that facilitates emergence and adult activity of this species during winter conditions. The implications of SCP and LLT50 with regard to life cycle dynamics are discussed.

AB  - Taking as example high-performance parabolic leaves made of the high-strength steel 52CrMoV4 used for the suspension of heavy truck axles, the present paper focuses on the effect of the manufacturing process (heat treatment and stress peening) on their performance under fatigue loading. Investigations of the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the core and the surface of selected prototype specimens reveal the degradation of the mechanical surface properties due to the applied manufacturing process. The results of these investigations have been used as input for analytical fatigue life calculations and the theoretical assessment of every individual life-influencing factor (material, heat treatment, surface treatment, loading). Wohler (S-N) curves for various probabilities of survival were experimentally determined and compared to the calculated ones. The agreement between Experiment and Theory is satisfactory.

TI  - Performance Improvement of a CPV System: Experimental Investigation into Passive Cooling with Phase Change Materials
VL  - 14
IS  - 12
AB  - High temperature and overheating of photovoltaic panels lead to efficiency losses and eventual degradation. For solar PV systems, this is a significant impediment for achieving economic viability. In this study, a novel Window-Integrated Concentrated Photovoltaic (WICPV) system is proposed for window integration. This offers high (50%) transparency and is fabricated and characterised indoors at an irradiance of 1000 Wm(-2). Its electrical performance is tested (a) without applied cooling (i.e., under natural ventilation) and (b) with a heat sink to accommodate passive cooling media. The results are compared to study the effects of reduction in operating temperature on system performances. The effectiveness of a sensible cooling medium (water) and two latent heat removal media, phase change materials (or PCMs, RT50 and RT28HC), is investigated. This paper reports the passive temperature regulation of this WICPV at ambient testing conditions. The results demonstrate an increase in electrical power output by (i) 17% (RT28HC), (ii) 19% (RT50), and (iii) 25 % (circulating water) compared with the naturally ventilated system. This shows that PCMs are considerably useful for thermal regulation of the WICPV. Any improvement in efficiencies will be beneficial for increasing electrical energy generation and reducing peak energy demands.

TI  - Parental effects improve escape performance of juvenile reef fish in a high-CO2 world
VL  - 281
IS  - 1777
AB  - Rising CO2 levels in the oceans are predicted to have serious consequences for many marine taxa. Recent studies suggest that non-genetic parental effectsmay reduce the impact of high CO2 on the growth, survival and routine metabolic rate of marine fishes, but whether the parental environment mitigates behavioural and sensory impairment associated with high CO2 remains unknown. Here, we tested the acute effects of elevated CO2 on the escape responses of juvenile fish and whether such effects were altered by exposure of parents to increased CO2 (transgenerational acclimation). Elevated CO2 negatively affected the reactivity and locomotor performance of juvenile fish, but parental exposure to high CO2 reduced the effects in some traits, indicating the potential for acclimation of behavioural impairment across generations. However, acclimation was not complete in some traits, and absent in others, suggesting that transgenerational acclimation does not completely compensate the effects of high CO2 on escape responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a destructive pest of Solanaceae crops worldwide. alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine are toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae crops and are most abundant in potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), accounting for more than 95% of the total SGAs. PTM grows on potatoes with a higher concentration of SGAs. Gut bacteria play an important role in the physiology and behavior of insects. To understand the role of gut bacteria of PTM in host adaptability, we isolated and identified major SGA (alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine)-degrading gut bacteria in the gut of PTM by a selective medium and analyzed their degradability and degradation mechanism.

AB  - Components of phenotypic covariance of fecundity with adult size were examined in the bug Dysdercus fasciatus in benign and stressful moisture environments. In addition, genetic relationships were explored between the character states in different environments. There was a positive and significant genetic association between fecundity and adult size in a benign environment. By contrast, the observed phenotypic covariability of fecundity with adult size in a stressful environment arose entirely from non-additive genetic plus maternal effects. Genetic correlations between the same character across environments were significantly less than unity for both adult size and fecundity. These results suggest that populations in benign and stressful moisture environments would respond to selection on adult size and fecundity in different ways.

TI  - Assessment of a novel solid oxide fuel cell tri-generation system for building applications
VL  - 124
SP  - 29-41
AB  - The paper provides a performance analysis assessment of a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) liquid desiccant tri-generation system for building applications. The work presented serves to build upon the current literature related to experimental evaluations of SOFC tri-generation systems, particularly in domestic built environment applications. The proposed SOFC liquid desiccant tri-generation system will be the first-of-its-kind. No research activity is reported on the integration of SOFC, or any fuel cell, with liquid desiccant air conditioning in a tri-generation system configuration. The novel tri-generation system is suited to applications that require simultaneous electrical power, heating and dehumidification cooling. There are several specific benefits to the integration of SOFC and liquid desiccant air conditioning technology, including; very high operational electrical efficiencies even at low system capacities and the ability to utilise low-grade thermal energy in a (useful) cooling process. Furthermore, the novel tri-generation system has the potential to increase thermal energy utilisation and thus the access to the benefits achievable from on-site electrical generation, primarily; reduced emissions and operating costs. Using empirical SOFC and liquid desiccant component data, an energetic, economic and environmental performance analysis assessment of the novel system is presented. Significant conclusions from the work include: (1) SOFC and liquid desiccant are a viable technological pairing in the development of an efficient and effective tri-generation system. High tri-generation efficiencies in the range of 68-71% are attainable. (2) The inclusion of liquid desiccant provides an efficiency increase of 9-15% compared to SOFC electrical operation only, demonstrating the potential of the system in building applications that require simultaneous electrical power, heating and/or dehumidification/cooling. (3) Compared to an equivalent base case system, the novel tri-generation system is currently only economically viable with a government's financial support. SOFC capital cost and stack replacement are the largest inhibitors to economic viability. Environmental performance is closely linked to electrical emission factor, and thus performance is heavily country dependent. (4) The economic and environmental feasibility of the novel tri-generation system will improve with predicted SOFC capital cost reductions and the transition to clean hydrogen production.

TI  - Effects of heat stress and exposure duration on survival characteristics of different developmental stages of Propylaea japonica, a dominant aphidophagous ladybeetle in China
VL  - 130
AB  - Extreme high temperatures in summer become more and more universal. However, the effects of high temperature on fitness and performance of different developmental stages in most biological control agents are very limited. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of heat stress and exposure duration on the survival characteristics of immature and adult stages of Propylaea japonica, a dominant aphidophagous ladybeetle in China. Here, we investigated the survival characteristics of different developmental stages in P. japonica when subjecting to high temperatures, 35, 37, 39, 41 and 43 degrees C for exposure durations of 1, 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively, and 25 degrees C is the control. The results indicated that egg survival greatly decreased only at 43 degrees C for 4 h or 6 h, and had no significant difference from 25 to 41 degrees C for any exposure duration. The younger larvae were the most vulnerable stage with the minimum survival exposure to high temperature but older larvae showed stronger resistance to heat stress. The survivals of pupae and adult stages rapidly decreased only at 43 degrees C for exceeding 2 h. These results suggest that different developmental stages of P. japonica possess different degrees of heat resistance, which ensures its survival in summer. Moreover, according to the heat resistance of several natural enemy insects in our previous reports and the present results, a comprehensive utilization strategy of aphid biological control was constructed to restrain aphid damage and population growth in challenging environment.

VL  - 7

SP  - 281-299
AB  - This paper addresses the issue of optimal allocation of spare modules in large series-redundant systems in order to obtain a required reliability under cost constraints. Both cases of active and standby redundancy are considered. Moreover, for a subsystem with standby redundancy, two cases are examined: in the first case, all the spares are maintained in cold state (cold standby redundancy) and, in the second one, to reduce the time needed to put a spare into operation when the active one fails, one of the spares is maintained in warm conditions. To solve this optimization problem, for the simpler case of active redundancy an analytical method based on the Lagrange multipliers technique is first applied. Then the results are improved by using Pairwise Hill Climbing, an original fine-tuning algorithm. An alternative approach is an innovative evolutionary algorithm, RELIVE, in which an individual lives for several generations and improves its fitness based on local search. These methods are especially needed in case of very large systems.

VL  - 44

AB  - Encarsia guadeloupae Viggiani is an important parasitoid of Aleurodicus dispersus Russell. The effects of temperature (16, 20, 24, 28, and 32A degrees C) on development and reproduction of this parasitoid on A. dispersus were studied in laboratory experiments. The developmental duration of E. guadeloupae varied from 14.9 (32A degrees C) to 54.4 days (16A degrees C). The developmental threshold and thermal constant for an entire generation were 10.52A degrees C and 308.85 degree-days, respectively. The highest survival rate (63.8%) of immature E. guadeloupae was recorded at 28A degrees C. The average adult longevity ranged from 6.0 (32A degrees C) to 15.1 days (16A degrees C). The highest fecundity was observed at 28A degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r (m) ), net reproduction rate (R (o) ), and finite rate of increase (lambda) were the highest at 28A degrees C, which were 0.18, 54.25 and 1.21, respectively. We concluded that 28A degrees C is the most suitable temperature for development and reproduction of E. guadeloupae.

TI  - CYTOPLASMIC MALE-STERILE SYNTHETICS - A NEW APPROACH TO THE EXPLOITATION OF HETEROSIS IN RAPE
VL  - 91
IS  - 6
SP  - 1173-1176
AB  - In addition to their application in the production of F-1 hybrids in rape (Brassica napus L.), cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) systems may be used to produce synthetic varieties with much higher levels of heterozygosity than those expected in conventional rape synthetics. CMS synthetics are produced by compositing a CMS A-line with several male-fertile (MF) B-lines lacking nuclear alleles for fertility restoration, and increasing the resulting mixture by natural pollination. Over generations of increase, pollination of the CMS component by the MF component of the synthetic results in the progressive loss of A-line nuclear genes from the population. The initial proportions of CMS and MF plants are expected to be preserved over several generations of natural pollination if CMS and MF plants are equal in yield. Methods for estimating the heterozygosity level of CMS synthetics, taking into account the proportion of CMS plants, number of MF parents in Syn 0, and selfing rate (s) of MF plants, are presented. If completely inbred Syn 0 parents and s of 0 and 0.75 for CMS and MF plants respectively, are assumed, the heterozygosity level (1-F) of a synthetic derived from four inbred MF parents each comprising 6.25% of Syn 0 and one inbred CMS parent comprising 75% of Syn 0 is predicted to be 0.66 in Syn 5, compared to 0.30 in synthetics derived from four MF parents only. CMS synthetics offer a novel, low-cost approach to the exploitation of heterosis in rape and other species with mixed mating systems in which self-pollination predominates.

TI  - Biological characteristics of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) under temperature stress by successive generations
VL  - 5
IS  - 2
SP  - 72-75
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological characteristics of Trichogramma pretiosum (Riley 1879) under room temperature and temperature stress by successive generations. The evaluation was carried out in split-plot in the time. The temperature (25 degrees C - room temperature and 33 degrees C - temperature stress) was the Factor 1 and the Generations (n = 15) were the Factor 2. The biological characteristics evaluated were: longevity; posterior tibia length; number of parasitized eggs; emergence; egg-adult period; sexual ratio and deformed individuals. The increase in temperature, from the first generations of T pretiosum, caused an influence in all observed variables. However, for the emergence and sex ratio variables, there was no significant difference between heat stress and control (room temperature) as of the 14th generation, which suggests an adaptability of the species. This adaptability may imply obtaining more aggressive natural enemies in relation to their host (insect pest) and consequently in the greater efficiency of biological control.

AB  - The workplace influences the safety, health, and productivity of workers at multiple levels. To protect and promote total worker health, smart hardware, and software tools have emerged for the identification, elimination, substitution, and control of occupational hazards. Wearable devices enable constant monitoring of individual workers and the environment, whereas connected worker solutions provide contextual information and decision support. Here, the recent trends in commercial workplace technologies to monitor and manage occupational risks, injuries, accidents, and diseases are reviewed. Workplace safety wearables for safe lifting, ergonomics, hazard identification, sleep monitoring, fatigue management, and heat and cold stress are discussed. Examples of workplace productivity wearables for asset tracking, augmented reality, gesture and motion control, brain wave sensing, and work stress management are given. Workplace health wearables designed for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, functional movement disorders, respiratory hazards, cardiovascular health, outdoor sun exposure, and continuous glucose monitoring are shown. Connected worker platforms are discussed with information about the architecture, system modules, intelligent operations, and industry applications. Predictive analytics provide contextual information about occupational safety risks, resource allocation, equipment failure, and predictive maintenance. Altogether, these examples highlight the ground-level benefits of real-time visibility about frontline workers, work environment, distributed assets, workforce efficiency, and safety compliance.

TI  - Identification of quantitative trait loci controlling winter hardiness in an annual x perennial ryegrass interspecific hybrid population
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 125-136
AB  - Winter hardiness is a quantitative trait and the lack of it limits geographic distribution of ryegrass. Improving winter hardiness is an important breeding goal in ryegrass breeding programs. An understanding of the genetic basis for the component traits of winter hardiness would allow more efficient selection. A three-generation interspecific population of an annual x perennial ryegrass consisting of 152 progenies was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control winter hardiness-related traits including fall growth (FG), freezing tolerance (FT), and winter survival (WS) over 2 years. A total of 39 QTL were identified for the three traits from both the female parental (MFA) and the male parental (MFB) maps, of which 13 were for FG, 6 for FT, and 20 for WS. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 10.4 to 22.1%. Both FG and FT were positively correlated with WS. Common QTL were detected between FG, FT, and WS. The QTL associated with WS on linkage groups (LGs) 4 and 5, and the QTL for FT on LG 5 were consistently identified over years and maps. These consistent QTL might serve as potential tools for marker-assisted selection to improve ryegrass winter hardiness.

TI  - Economic and risk assessment of industrial wood chip drying
VL  - 44
AB  - Fresh wood chips with natural moisture (wet chips) have been used for energy generation. Wood chip drying is an alternative of pretreatment aimed to improve quality, but its viability needs to be tested, since this process is energetically and economically expensive. This work presents an assessment of a local industry that dries wood chips utilizing a rotary dryer, allowing it to establish a base case scenario for biomass drying. From this, different alternatives of energy and raw material consumption scenarios were established. Risk and sensitivity analyzes were performed to measure the impact on economic indicators. The risk analysis was carried out via Monte Carlo simulations. The results showed that the project is economically viable, with a payback period of 1.67 years, an Internal Rate Return of 60.2% and a Benefit Cost Ratio of 1.39. The sensitivity analysis showed that even with a 28.6% increase in purchase price and a 21.4% decrease in the sale price of wood chips, the economic indicators remained viable. Under the conditions evaluated, no significant risk (p < 0.1%) to the project viability was identified.

TI  - Energy and exergy analysis of a novel humidification-dehumidification desalination system with fogging technique
VL  - 522
AB  - The availability of fresh water is essential for human being lives existence. But most of the time, it is not a naturally guaranteed and accessible option for nearly all the world's countries. As a mission to maintain the presence of freshwater, the aim of this paper is to provide and examine a new humidification-dehumidification (HDH) water desalination system. The provided HDH system is equipped with the fogging nozzles technique that is experimentally proofed, when compared to other HDH systems, to impacting the performance positively in terms of reducing the exergy destruction of the desalination process. A regular jet nozzle and two fogging nozzles with different droplet sizes (20 and 30 microns) were used to examine the effect of the droplet size on the amount of entropy generation. For all air flow rates, using the fogging nozzles reduces the total specific entropy generation greatly in comparison with the regular jet nozzle. The 20-micron nozzle shows a higher ability in reducing the specific entropy generation when compared to the 30-micron nozzle. The performance of the HDH system was judged using the gained-output ratio (GOR). The maximum GOR value of 3.4, and the minimum specific entropy generation value of 0.235 were achieved at a 0.78 mass flow rate ratio, which indicates that using the fogging nozzles technique increases the recovered energy from the humidifier's freshwater outlet. The entropy generation curve for the humidifier and the dehumidifier experienced no change under the variations of the mass flow rate ratio. Therefore, the fogging nozzles technique limits the entropy generation in the HDH system even at higher seawater inlet flow rates due to the larger contact area and the smaller water droplets that generate higher evaporation and condensation rates at the humidifier and dehumidifier units, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the inlet air temperature has positive effects on the HDH system by reducing slightly the total amount of entropy generation.

AB  - Quadrupoles in the fragment separator region of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will be subjected to very large heat loads (over 200 Watts) and an intense level of radiation (similar to 10 MGy per year) into the coils of just the first magnet. Magnets made with High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) are advantageous over conventional superconducting magnets since they can remove these heat loads more efficiently at higher temperatures. The proposed design is based on second generation (2G) HTS which allows operation at similar to 50 K. 2G has been found to be highly radiation tolerant. The latest test results are summarized. The goal of this R&D program is to evaluate the viability of HTS in a real machine with magnets in a challenging environment where HTS offers a unique solution.

TI  - Aggregations of egg-brooding deep-sea fish and cephalopods on the Gorda Escarpment: A reproductive hot spot
VL  - 205
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-7
AB  - Localized areas of intense biological activity, or hot spots, in the deep sea are infrequent but important features in an otherwise sparsely occupied habitat (1). Hydrothermal vents, methane cold seeps, and the tops of seamounts are well documented areas where dense communities persist for generations (2-5). Reproductive aggregations where conspecifics concentrate for the purposes of spawning or egg brooding could be thought of as transient hot spots. It is likely that they occur in populations with low densities to maximize mate location and increase reproductive success (6). However, only a few deep-sea reproductive aggregations have ever been documented (7-9), demonstrating the paucity of present-day information regarding reproductive behavior of deep-sea animals. In this paper we describe a unique multispecies reproductive aggregation located on the Gorda Escarpment, California. We document some of the highest fish and octopus densities ever reported in the deep sea, with most individuals of both species brooding eggs. We describe the nesting behavior of the blob sculpin, Psychrolutes phrictus, and the egg-brooding behavior of an octopus, Graneledone sp. observed during annual dives of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on the Gorda Escarpment. The animals are concentrated at the crest of the local topography and near cold seeps where they may benefit from enhanced current flow and local productivity. These findings provide new information on the reproductive behaviors of deep-sea animals. More importantly, they highlight how physical and bathymetric heterogeneity in the environment can result in reproductive hot spots, which may be a critical resource for reproductive success in some deep-sea species.

VL  - 1112
SP  - 321-325
AB  - Renewable energy can be produced from a number of sources, including plant biomass. One of the most efficient technologies to generate bioenergy from plant biomass is on-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) producing biogas. Biogas can be used as an equal substitute to natural gas for industrial, commercial and residential use, and/or can be converted to electricity, heat or vehicle fuel using established technologies. Using purified biogas for transport is a highly effective greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. Various organic feed stocks can be converted into biogas: we have identified a large variety of purpose-grown bioenergy crop species (such as Jerusalem artichoke, forage sorghum, whole triticale) under New Zealand conditions, but feedstocks can also include farm and orchard waste streams (reject fruit, clippings, thinning and so on), groundcover biomass and other locally sourced organic municipal and industrial bio-waste as well. A novel biofuel cropping system was developed based on AD technology. It makes full use of the nutrients in the digestate with a unique closed-loop nutrient supply feature that conserves nutrients in the feedstock and recycles them back to the farm and orchard as bio-fertiliser. This eliminates the need for external fertilizer. This paper will explore the considerable potential for bioenergy generation and nutrient recycling in horticultural production systems in New Zealand.

TI  - Evolution of plasticity in production and transgenerational inheritance of small RNAs under dynamic environmental conditions
VL  - 17
IS  - 5
AB  - In a changing environment, small RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and can vary in abundance depending on the conditions experienced by an individual (phenotypic plasticity) and its parents (non-genetic inheritance). Many sRNAs are unusual in that they can be produced in two ways, either using genomic DNA as the template (primary sRNAs) or existing sRNAs as the template (secondary sRNAs). Thus, organisms can evolve rapid plastic responses to their current environment by adjusting the amplification rate of sRNA templates. sRNA levels can also be transmitted transgenerationally by the direct transfer of either sRNAs or the proteins involved in amplification. Theory is needed to describe the selective forces acting on sRNA levels, accounting for the dual nature of sRNAs as regulatory elements and templates for amplification and for the potential to transmit sRNAs and their amplification agents to offspring. Here, we develop a model to study the dynamics of sRNA production and inheritance in a fluctuating environment. We tested the selective advantage of mutants capable of sRNA-mediated phenotypic plasticity within resident populations with fixed levels of sRNA transcription. Even when the resident was allowed to evolve an optimal constant rate of sRNA production, plastic amplification rates capable of responding to environmental conditions were favored. Mechanisms allowing sRNA transcripts or amplification agents to be inherited were favored primarily when parents and offspring face similar environments and when selection acts before the optimal level of sRNA can be reached within the organism. Our study provides a clear set of testable predictions for the evolution of sRNA-related mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and transgenerational inheritance. Author summary Small RNAs (sRNA) are produced by a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. These molecules are involved in the response to environmental stress (e.g., temperature, pathogens) and can be transmitted across generations. We developed a model to explore the dynamics of sRNA production (phenotypic plasticity) and inheritance in a fluctuating environment. We tested whether different sRNA mutants can invade a population where individuals produce sRNA at a constant optimal transcription rate. In our simulations, plastic amplification rates capable of responding to environmental conditions were favored and the transmission of sRNA transcripts or amplification agents across generations was particularly advantageous when parents and offspring faced similar environments. sRNA amplification alone is not favored except when optimal sRNA levels are not reached within a generation. Our model provides novel predictions for the molecular mechanisms of sRNA production and guidance for future empirical studies on mutations that impair the mechanisms of sRNA production and their fitness consequences.

TI  - Biological parameters of stem borer Stromatium barbatum reared on grapevine wood logs under laboratory conditions
VL  - 41

SP  - 2795-2803
AB  - Stem borer Stromatium barbatum has recently emerged as a serious pest problem of grapevines in India. Hidden biology and lack of effective chemical control of stem borer warranted finding out weak links in its life cycle which aids in formulating effective management strategies. Being a monovoltine pest with annual life cycle, the systematic studies on developmental biology and stage specific mortality of stem borer in grapes are limited. In present study, a cohort life table was constructed for S. barbatum by rearing it on grapevine wood logs in the laboratory at 27 +/- 1 celcius temperature and 65 +/- 5% RH. The life cycle of S. barbatum was tracked from egg hatching through larval and pupal stages till adult emergence and observations were recorded on stage specific developmental durations and mortality of immature stages, and longevity and fecundity of adult stages. The results revealed that the mean durations of egg, larvae and pupae were 6.60 +/- 0.28 days, 296.10 +/- 1.06 days and 19.70 +/- 1.17 days, respectively. The adults after emerging from pupae could survive up to 36.40 +/- 0.81 days. The egg hatching and adult emergence from pupae were 42.51% and 83.02%, respectively. S. barbatum population attained a net reproductive rate of 64.96 females/female/generation and a gross reproductive rate of 72.93 females/female/generation in her mean oviposition period of 9.80 +/- 0.13 days. The data indicated that, S. barbatum population potentially might increase with an intrinsic rate (r(m)) of 0.087 females/female/day and a finite rate (lambda) of 1.09 females/female/day with a doubling time of 9.98 days and a mean generation time of 324.30 days. The mortality was relatively higher during the egg and larval stages, which was then gradually decreased for rest of the life span when S. babatum was reared on grapevine wood logs under laboratory conditions. Generation mortality for S. barbatum was 90.72%. The present study has generated detailed information on critical life events such as days to egg hatch, adult longevity and fecundity, time required for adults to oviposit after mating, and age-stage specific mortality. This could facilitate formulation and implementation of effective management strategies for S. barbatum in grape vineyards.

AB  - Population dynamics of Meloidogyne chitwoodi were studied for 2 years in a commercial potato field and microplots. Annual second-stage juvenile (J2) densities peaked at harvest in midfall, declined through the winter, and were lowest in early summer. In the field and in one microplot study, population increase displayed trimodal patterns during the 1984 and 1985 seasons. Over-wintering nematodes produced egg masses on roots by 600-800 degree-days base 5 C (DD5) after planting. Second-generation and third-generation eggs hatched by 950-1,100 DD5 and 1,500-1,600 DD5, respectively, and J2 densities rapidly increased in the soil. A fourth generation was observed at 2,150 DD5 in 1985 microplot studies. Tubers were initiated by 450-500 DD5, but J2 were not observed in the tubers until after the second generation hatched at 988-1,166 DD5. A second period of tuber invasion was observed when third generation J2 hatched. The regional variation in M. chitwoodi damage on potato may be explained by degree-day accumulation in different potato production regions of the western United States.

AB  - The proteostasis network (PN) regulates protein synthesis, folding, and degradation and is critical for the health and function of all cells. The PN has been extensively studied in the context of aging and age-related diseases, and loss of proteostasis is regarded as a major contributor to many age-associated disorders. In contrast to somatic tissues, an important feature of germ cells is their ability to maintain a healthy proteome across generations. Accumulating evidence has now revealed multiple layers of PN regulation that support germ cell function, determine reproductive capacity during aging, and prioritize reproduction at the expense of somatic health. Here, we review recent insights into these different modes of regulation and their implications for reproductive and somatic aging.

TI  - Daily temperature fluctuations unpredictably influence developmental rate and morphology at a critical early larval stage in a frog
VL  - 13
AB  - Background: Environmental temperature has profound consequences for early amphibian development and many field and laboratory studies have examined this. Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. Results: We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14 degrees C and 36 degrees C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and four levels of thermal variation (0 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 13 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24 degrees C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that both the magnitude of DTF range and thermal averages need to be considered simultaneously when parsing the effects of changing thermal environments on complex developmental responses, particularly when they have potential functional and adaptive significance.

TI  - Can larvae of a marine fish adapt to ocean acidification? Evaluating the evolutionary potential of California Grunion (Leuresthes tenuis)
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SP  - 560-571
AB  - Ocean acidification can reduce the growth and survival of marine species during their larval stages. However, if populations have the genetic capacity to adapt and increase their tolerance of low pH and high pCO(2) levels, this may offset the harmful effects of ocean acidification. By combining controlled breeding experiments with laboratory manipulations of seawater chemistry, we evaluated genetic variation in tolerance of ocean acidification conditions for a nearshore marine fish, the California Grunion (Leuresthes tenuis). Our results indicated that acidification conditions increased overall mortality rates of grunion larvae, but did not have a significant effect on growth. Groups of larvae varied widely with respect to mortality and growth rates in both ambient and acidified conditions. We demonstrate that the potential to evolve in response to ocean acidification is best described by considering additive genetic variation in fitness-related traits under both ambient and acidified conditions and by evaluating the genetic correlation between traits expressed in these environments. We used a multivariate animal model to estimate additive genetic (co)variance in larval growth and mortality rates under both ambient and acidified conditions (low pH/high pCO(2)). Our results suggest appreciable genetic variation in larval mortality rates (h(Ambient)(2) = 0.120; h(Acidified)(2) = 0.183; r(G) = 0.460), but less genetic variation in growth (h(Ambient)(2) = 0.092; h(Acidified)(2) = 0.101; r(G) = 0.135). Maternal effects on larval mortality rates accounted for 26%-36% of the variation in phenotypes, but maternal effects accounted for only 8% of the variation in growth. Collectively, our estimates of genetic variation and covariation suggest that populations of California Grunion have the capacity to adapt relatively quickly to long-term changes in ocean chemistry.

TI  - Biomass Power Generation through Direct Integration of Updraft Gasifier and Stirling Engine Combustion System
AB  - Biomass is the largest renewable energy source in the world. Its importance grows gradually in the future energy market. Since most biomass sources are low in energy density and are widespread in space, small-scale biomass conversion system is therefore more competitive than a large stand-alone conversion plant. The current study proposes a small-scale solid biomass power system to explore the viability of direct coupling of an updraft fixed bed gasifier with a Stirling engine. The modified updraft fixed bed gasifier employs an embedded combustor inside the gasifier to fully combust the synthetic gas generated by the gasifier. The flue gas produced by the synthetic gas combustion inside the combustion tube is piped directly to the heater head of the Stirling engine. The engine will then extract and convert the heat contained in the flue gas into electricity automatically. Output depends on heat input. And, the heat input is proportional to the flow rate and temperature of the flue gas. The preliminary study of the proposed direct coupling of an updraft gasifier with a 25 kW Stirling engine demonstrates that full power output could be produced by the current system. It could be found from the current investigation that no auxiliary fuel is required to operate the current system smoothly. The proposed technology and units could be considered as a viable solid biomass power system.

TI  - JOULE HEATING EFFECT REDUCTION OF AN ELECTROMAGNET SYSTEM UTILIZING ON-CHIP MAGNETIC CORE
VL  - 78

SP  - 105-112
AB  - Joule heating effect is substantial in an electromagnet system due to high density current from current-carrying conductor for high magnetic field generation. In Lab-on-chip (LoC) Magnetically Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) device, Joule heating effect generating high temperature and affecting the biological cells viability is investigated. The temperature rise of the integrated system was measured using resistance temperature detector, RTD Pt100. Three temperature rise conditions which are from the bare spiral-shaped magnet wire, the combination of magnet wire and on-chip magnetic core and combination of magnet wire, on-chip magnetic core and 150 mu m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer have been investigated. The combination of electromagnet of spiral-shaped magnet wire coil and on-chip magnetic core has reduced the temperature significantly which are, similar to 38 % and similar to 26 % with magnet wire winding, N = 10 (I-DC = 3.0 A, t = 210 s) and N = 20 (I-DC = 2.5 A, t = 210 s) respectively. The reduced Joule heating effect is expected due to silicon chip of high thermal conductivity material enable fast heat dissipation to the surrounding. Therefore, the integration of electromagnet system and on-chip magnetic core has the potential to be used as part of LoC MACS system provided the optimum operating conditions are determined.

TI  - Advanced Laser Techniques from Semiconductor Manufacturing Transition to Solar PV Production
VL  - 7585
AB  - For semiconductor manufacturing, a mature industry, a number of laser techniques are employed in production. Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) lasers are used in applications that cannot be performed by mechanical, chemical, or other laser fabrication methods as well as where they add value through increased throughput and/or improved process quality. Applications such as edge isolation, wafer scribing/dicing, via formation, laser doping and annealing for Semicon are being applied to crystalline silicon PV manufacture as well as research and development for the next generation of high efficiency cells. Similarly, selective material removal for exposing underlying layers without thermal damage is vital in the production of thin film PV panels. In this paper, some of the most important applications of lasers along with experimental results will be reviewed to illustrate how laser methods can have a significant impact on the development and productivity of the photovoltaic industry.

TI  - Overwintering distribution, behavior, and survival of adult summer steelhead: Variability among Columbia river populations
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-96
AB  - Unlike most anadromous salmonids, summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss overwinter in rivers rather than the ocean for 6-10 months prior to spring spawning. Overwintering in rivers may make summer steelhead more vulnerable to harvest and other mortality sources than are other anadromous populations, but there has been little systematic study of this life history strategy. Here, we used a large-scale radiotelemetry study to examine the overwintering behaviors and distributions of 26 summer steelhead stocks within the regulated lower Columbia-Snake River hydrosystem. Over 6 years, we monitored 5,939 fish, of which 3,399 successfully reached spawning tributaries or the upper Columbia River basin and were assigned to specific populations. An estimated 12.4% of fish that reached spawning areas overwintered at least partially within the hydrosystem (annual estimates = 6.8-19.6%), while the remainder overwintered in tributaries. Across all populations, later-arriving fish were more likely to overwinter in the hydrosystem; overwintering percentages ranged from less than 1% for fish tagged in June to over 40% for those tagged in October. Proportionately more interior-basin steelhead (Clearwater, Salmon, and Snake River metapopulations) overwintered in the hydrosystem than did fish from lower-river populations. Steelhead were distributed in mixed-stock assemblages throughout the hydrosystem during winter, usually in reservoirs closest to their home rivers but also in nonnatal tributaries. Overwintering fish moved upstream and downstream between reaches in all months; a nadir occurred in early January and peak egress into spawning tributaries was in March. The estimated survival to tributaries was higher for fish that overwintered in the hydrosystem (82%) than for fish that did not (62%); this difference was largely attributable to low winter harvest rates. Our results suggest that large main-stem habitats, including reservoirs, may be widely used by overwintering summer steelhead. The complex migration behaviors of steelhead indicate both the potential for adaptation and possible susceptibility to future river environment changes.

TI  - The active spread of adaptive variation for reef resilience
VL  - 9
IS  - 19
SP  - 11122-11135
AB  - The speed at which species adapt depends partly on the rates of beneficial adaptation generation and how quickly they spread within and among populations. Natural rates of adaptation of corals may not be able to keep pace with climate warming. Several interventions have been proposed to fast-track thermal adaptation, including the intentional translocation of warm-adapted adults or their offspring (assisted gene flow, AGF) and the ex situ crossing of warm-adapted corals with conspecifics from cooler reefs (hybridization or selective breeding) and field deployment of those offspring. The introgression of temperature tolerance loci into the genomic background of cooler-environment corals aims to facilitate adaptation to warming while maintaining fitness under local conditions. Here we use research on selective sweeps and connectivity to understand the spread of adaptive variants as it applies to AGF on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), focusing on the genus Acropora. Using larval biophysical dispersal modeling, we estimate levels of natural connectivity in warm-adapted northern corals. We then model the spread of adaptive variants from single and multiple reefs and assess if the natural and assisted spread of adaptive variants will occur fast enough to prepare receiving central and southern populations given current rates of warming. We also estimate fixation rates and spatial extent of fixation under multiple release scenarios to inform intervention design. Our results suggest that thermal tolerance is unlikely to spread beyond northern reefs to the central and southern GBR without intervention, and if it does, 30+ generations are needed for adaptive gene variants to reach fixation even under multiple release scenarios. We argue that if translocation, breeding, and reseeding risks are managed, AGF using multiple release reefs can be beneficial for the restoration of coral populations. These interventions should be considered in addition to conventional management and accompanied by strong mitigation of CO2 emissions.

TI  - A New Evolutionary Approach to Optimal Sensor Placement in Water Distribution Networks
VL  - 13
IS  - 12
AB  - The sensor placement problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem with Boolean decision variables. A new multi objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed for approximating and analyzing the set of Pareto optimal solutions. The evaluation of the objective functions requires the execution of a hydraulic simulation model of the network. To organize the simulation results a data structure is proposed which enables the dynamic representation of a sensor placement and its fitness as a heatmap. This allows the definition of information spaces, in which the fitness of a placement can be represented as a matrix or, in probabilistic terms as a histogram. The key element in the new algorithm is this probabilistic representation which is embedded in a space endowed with a metric based on a specific notion of distance. Among several distances between probability distributions the Wasserstein (WST) distance has been selected: WST has enabled to derive new genetic operators, indicators of the quality of the Pareto set and criteria to choose among the Pareto solutions. The new algorithm has been tested on a benchmark water distribution network with two objective functions showing an improvement over NSGA-II, in particular for low generation counts, making it a good candidate for expensive black-box multi-objective optimization

AB  - This biology of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley and T. exiguum Pinto & Platner in Plutella xylostella (L.) eggs was studied at seven constant temperatures, and the thermal requirements and number of generations of both parasitoids was determined for some crucifers producers of the states of Espirito Santo and Pernambuco. Eggs of P. xylostella were submitted to parasitism by T pretiosum and T exiguum for 5h, and transferred to climatic chambers regulated to 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30 and 32degreesC. The developmental time was influenced by the temperature varying from 6.8 to 23.1 days for T pretiosum and 6.9 to 22.0 days for T exiguum at 32 and 18degreesC, respectively. The percentage of emergence was higher at 28degreesC, reaching 86% for both species. The sex ratio was always 1 for T pretiosum and varied from 0.6 to 0.9 for T exiguum. The thermal constant (K) and base temperature (Tb) were higher for T exiguum (129.99 days degrees and 13.13degreesC) when compared with T pretiosum (123.03 days degrees and 12.52degreesC). The estimated number of annual generations of T pretiosum and T exiguum for Gravata district was 36.9 and 36.7 generations respectively. The same number, however for Muniz Freire, ES, was 24.1 and 24.5, and for Alegre, ES, 26.7 and 27.0 generations for T pretiosum and T exiguum respectively.

TI  - Coffee pest severity by agrometeorological models in subtropical climate
VL  - 66
IS  - 5
SP  - 957-969
AB  - This study aimed to estimate the number of generations and cycle duration of the southern red mite, coffee berry borer, and coffee leaf miner using the thermal index to assist in controlling these main coffee pests in the state of Parana, Brazil. The data of maximum and minimum air temperature (degrees C) and precipitation (mm) of all municipalities in the state from 1984 to 2018 were collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA/ POWER). The reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the (Camargo Campinas IAC Boletim 116:9, 1971) method and the water balance was calculated using the method of (Thornthwaite C, Mather J (1955) The water balance publications in climatology, 8 (1). DIT, Laboratory of climatology, Centerton, NJ, USA). The basal temperature of each pest minus the average temperature of the years was used to calculate the degrees-day, the duration of the pest cycle, and the number of generations per year. The influence of altitude on the development of coffee pests was measured using the Pearson correlation. The thermal index is able to estimate the damage caused by coffee pests in the state of Para, Brazil. Coffee pests show greater severity in the north of Parana, in the regions with the highest temperatures. It is the same region that concentrates most of the coffee production of the state. The results of the life cycle and number of generations were interpolated for the entire state using the kriging method. Coffee pests showed the highest severity in the north region of the state of Parana, more specifically in the Northwest, North Central, and West Central mesoregions. These regions have concentrated most of the state's coffee production. Mesoregions with the highest coffee production in the state showed higher susceptibility to coffee pests. Altitude showed a high correlation (r> 0.6) with the cycle variability and number of generations of coffee pests. The average cycles of the coffee berry borer, coffee leaf miner, and southern red mite are 24.13 (+/- 8.34), 45.64 (+/- 18.61), and 21.51 (+/- 3.51) days, respectively. The average annual generation was 16.67 (+/- 4.77), 9.02 (+/- 2.75), and 17.32 (+/- 2.63) generations, for the coffee berry borer, the coffee red mite, and the southern red mite, respectively.

VL  - 62

SP  - 221-228
AB  - The present work contributes to an accurate quantification method of the parameters of the biotic potential of Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera Aphelinidae), applicable to other species of whitefly parasitoids. The oviposition devices are easy to make and they allow standardisation of a whitefly parasitoid Study by daily observations of the main parameters Such as fecundity, longevity and host-feeding by adult parasitoids, which are important for the parasitoids mass-production and biological control of whiteflies. Results show that two physical parameters determine the expression of biotic potential: the confinement induces all important decrease of the fecundity and longevity off. formosa the position of plant leaf with nymphs of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Homoptera Aleyrodidae) that the parasitoid female call explore for oviposition and host-feeding influences Oil the biotic potential. The heterogeneity observed in the replicates suggests that during their mass-processing the parasitoids suffer abiotic conditions leading to changes in the biotic potential of progeny. Under strictly constant laboratory conditions of temperature, hygrometry and photoperiod, an identical trend is observed for mother and daughter generations: fecundity and longevity are higher in aired oviposition devices and exploitable host-nymphs oil leaf situated on top of device. In these laboratory conditions, results for fecundity and longevity are better, and the same trend is observed for host-feeding of mother and daughter generations. The above defined standardised methodology will allow comparison of the biotic potential of other species of whitefly parasitoids because it reduces variations of abiotic origin.

TI  - Climate change effects on walnut pests in California
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 228-238
AB  - Increasing temperatures are likely to impact ectothermic pests of fruits and nuts. This paper aims to assess changes to pest pressure in California's US$0.7 billion walnut industry due to recent historic and projected future temperature changes. For two past (1950 and 2000) and 18 future climate scenarios (2041-2060 and 2080-2099; each for three General Circulation Models and three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios), 100 years of hourly temperature were generated for 205 locations. Degree-day models were used to project mean generation numbers for codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella Walker), two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and European red mite (Panonychus ulmi Koch). In the Central Valley, the number of codling moth generations predicted for degree days accumulated between April 1 and October 1 rose from 2-4 in 1950 to 3-5 among all future scenarios. Generation numbers increased from 10-18 to 14-24 for two-spotted spider mite, from 9-14 to 14-20 for European red mite, and from 2-4 to up to 5 for navel orangeworm. Overall pest pressure can thus be expected to increase substantially. Our study did not include the possibility of higher winter survival rates, leading to higher initial pest counts in spring, or of extended pest development times in the summer, factors that are likely to exacerbate future pest pressure. On the other hand, initiation of diapause may prevent an extension of the season length for arthropods, and higher incidence of heat death in summer may constrain pest population sizes. More information on the impact of climate change on complex agroecological food webs and on the response of pests to high temperatures is needed for improving the reliability of projections.

SP  - 869-877
AB  - Slag accounts for most of the residuals or by-products of the steel manufacturing process and represents a not inconsiderable amount of energy waste and CO2 emissions. Energy recovery from steel mill slags is not actually performed because of the difficulty of the industrial implementation, but the actual demand and the incentives for new electricity generation plants based on renewable energies and on industrial waste heat recovery offer a new opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of this process. This article presents a review of the slag energy potential on a global scale, and a proposal for a recovery plant in the factories of Arcelor-Mittal in Asturias (Spain), based on a steam Rankine cycle for electricity production in a turbine. The plant production and viability have been analyzed using the typical technical and economic values for this kind of plant. Also, a parametric study has been performed on the heat recuperator efficiency and investment rate.

VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 245-273
AB  - Chiles hydroelectric industry was privatized in 1985, but required to operate within a regulatory framework designed to achieve a competitive outcome. A centralized dispatch center was established to ensure production at minimum cost, subject to constraints on minimum release and minimum reservoir stock. A reluctance to rapidly reduce the industry work force may also have existed. We develop a constrained cost-minimization model for thermal and hydro generation to obtain the shadow price of water and to determine the qualitative effect of these constraints on allocative efficiency. Using panel data from 1986-1997, we assess the economic efficiency of the hydro industry by estimating a stochastic distance frontier and price equations from the dual cost-minimization problem. We find dramatic increases in technical change and productivity change, with positive efficiency change for all years but the last. We also observe a dramatic decline in allocative inefficiencies over our sample period. The share of hydro generation from run-of-river and thermal plants relative to reservoir plants has increased, presumably in reaction to the water release and reservoir stock constraints, reducing the relative over-utilization of capital to water from the pre-1985 regime. Further, the over-utilization of labor to capital and water has fallen over time. However, considerable allocative inefficiencies remain, consistent with our finding of industry-wide scale economies. Substantial cost savings would result if technical and allocative efficiency were eliminated.

VL  - 12
IS  - 4
AB  - Background: A cylindrical piezoelectric element and a specific multi-channel circular microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-transducer array of ultrasonic system were used for ultrasonic energy generation and ablation. A relatively long time is required for the heat to be conducted to the target position. Ultrasound thermal therapy has great potential for treating deep hyperplastic tissues and tumors, such as breast cancer and liver tumors. Methods: Ultrasound ablation technology produces thermal energy by heating the surface of a target, and the heat gradually penetrates to the target's interior. Beamforming was performed to observe energy distribution. A resonance method was used to generate ablation energy for verification. Energy was generated according to the coordinates of geometric graph positions to reach the ablation temperature. Results: The mean resonance frequency of Channels 1-8 was 2.5 MHz, and the cylindrical piezoelectric ultrasonic element of Channel A was 4.2546 omega at 5.7946 MHz. High-intensity ultrasound has gradually been applied in clinical treatment. Widely adopted, ultrasonic hyperthermia involves the use of high-intensity ultrasound to heat tissues at 42-45 degrees C for 30-60 min. Conclusion: In the ultrasonic energy method, when the target position reaches a temperature that significantly reduces the cell viability (46.9 degrees C), protein surface modification occurs on the surface of the target.

VL  - 41

SP  - 605-615
AB  - An alternative method for fire smoke toxicity testing using human lung cells has been investigated. A laboratory-scale vertical tube furnace was used for the generation of combustion products. Experiments were conducted under isothermal oxidative non-flaming conditions. A range of building and train interiors including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP), and melamine-faced plywood (MFP) were studied. The exposure of combustion toxicants to human lung cells (A549) at the air/liquid interface was acquired using a Harvard Navicyte Chamber. Cytotoxic effects on human cells were assessed based on cell viability using the MTS assay (Promega). Cytotoxicity results were expressed as NOAEC (No Observable Adverse Effect Concentration), IC10 (10% inhibitory concentration), IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) and total lethal concentration (TLC) values (mg/L). These cytotoxicity results were compared to published combustion toxicity data. Mass loss data and toxic product yield were also determined. The following toxicity ranking was observed from the most toxic to the least toxic: PVC > PE > PP > FRP-10 > PC > FRP-16 > MFP. The method described here could potentially be an alternative to current fire toxicity standard test methods. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Recovery from hybrid breakdown reveals a complex genetic architecture of mitonuclear incompatibilities
VL  - 30
IS  - 23
SP  - 6403-6416
AB  - Reproductive isolation is often achieved when genes that are neutral or beneficial in their genomic background become functionally incompatible in a foreign genomic background, causing inviability, sterility or other forms of low fitness in hybrids. Recent studies suggest that mitonuclear interactions are among the initial incompatibilities to evolve at early stages of population divergence across taxa. Yet, the genomic architecture of mitonuclear incompatibilities has rarely been elucidated. We employ an experimental evolution approach starting with low-fitness F-2 interpopulation hybrids of the copepod Tigriopus califomicus, in which frequencies of compatible and incompatible nuclear alleles change in response to an alternative mitochondrial background. After about nine generations, we observe a generalized increase in population size and in survivorship, suggesting efficiency of selection against maladaptive phenotypes. Whole genome sequencing of evolved populations showed some consistent allele frequency changes across three replicates of each reciprocal cross, but markedly different patterns between mitochondria! backgrounds. In only a few regions (similar to 6.5% of the genome), the same parental allele was overrepresented irrespective of the mitochondrial background. About 33% of the genome showed allele frequency changes consistent with divergent selection, with the location of these genomic regions strongly differing between mitochondrial backgrounds. In 87% and 89% of these genomic regions, the dominant nuclear allele matched the associated mitochondrial background, consistent with mitonuclear co-adaptation. These results suggest that mitonuclear incompatibilities have a complex polygenic architecture that differs between populations, potentially generating genome-wide barriers to gene flow between closely related taxa.

TI  - Rapid spread of the defensive endosymbiont Spiroplasma in Drosophila hydei under high parasitoid wasp pressure
VL  - 91
IS  - 2
AB  - Maternally transmitted endosymbionts of insects are ubiquitous in nature and play diverse roles in the ecology and evolution of their hosts. To persist in host lineages, many symbionts manipulate host reproduction to their advantage (e. g. cytoplasmic incompatibility and male-killing), or confer fitness benefits to their hosts (e. g. metabolic provisioning and defense against natural enemies). Recent studies suggest that strains of the bacterial genus Spiroplasma protect their host (flies in the genus Drosophila) against parasitoid attack. The Spiroplasma-conferred protection is partial and flies surviving a wasp attack have reduced adult longevity and fecundity. Therefore, it is unclear whether protection against wasps alone can counter Spiroplasma loss by imperfect maternal transmission and any possible fitness costs to harboring Spiroplasma. To address this question, we conducted a population cage study comparing Spiroplasma frequencies over time (host generations) under conditions of high wasp pressure and no wasp pressure. A dramatic increase of Spiroplasma prevalence was observed under high wasp pressure. In contrast, Spiroplasma prevalence in the absence of wasps did not change significantly over time; a pattern consistent with random drift. Thus, the defensive mechanism may contribute to the high prevalence of Spiroplasma in host populations despite imperfect vertical transmission.

AB  - Postharvest quarantine treatments using high temperatures have been developed for various commodities. There are a wide range of insect pests that are the target of these treatments. In order to make heat treatments effective against these pests, the effects of high temperatures on insect physiology must be understood. Insects, being poikilothermic, are particularly sensitive to heat. Nearly every system studied in insects has demonstrated sensitivity to heat. Studies on the effects of heat in insect metabolism demonstrate some adaptability to thermally challenging environments. Respiration, as to be expected, is also effected by heat, and as the body temperature of the insect increases, there are concomitant increases in both metabolism and respiration up to a critical thermal limit. The effects of heat on the nervous and endocrine systems is another area where elevated temperatures wreck havoc. Changes in behavior and development have been documented as resulting from heat treatments. Among the most studied responses of insects to heat is the elicitation of heat shock proteins. The impact of these proteins on thermotolerance are still being investigated. Models of thermal damage leading to the death of the insect are discussed as well as current studies in describing the events of thermal death. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - A technology overview of thermal management of integrated motor drives-Electrical Machines
VL  - 29
AB  - This paper provides a technology overview of integrated motor drives (IMDs), with a focus on thermal management of high-specific-output and high-efficiency electrical machines. The early examples of integrating electronics with electrical machines were introduced in the 1960's. Here, both passive and active cooling techniques were employed to provide compact and robust electronics-motor systems, predominantly for automotive and aerospace applications. The latest examples of IMDs share the same generic concepts of thermal management, where dedicated or shared cooling of the individual IMD subsystems is used. However, the modern IMDs illustrate a more comprehensive integration approach, where the complete power electronics inverter and electrical machine are frequently accompanied by other subsystems, e.g. mechanical transmission, suspension, clutching, braking and others. Again, the automotive and aerospace industries have been paving the way towards high-specific-output and high-efficiency IMDs, but it is important to note that the low-power applications, e.g. consumers electronics, health and beauty goods, home appliances, garden and power tools, personal mobility vehicles and many others have been adopting the IMDs for decades now. Interestingly, some of the generic concepts first successfully introduced in low-power devices found their use in more demanding high-power applications.In general, thermal management of electrical machines in IMDs is analogous to that used in discrete motor drives (DMDs). The continuous drive towards high-specific-output and high-efficiency electrical machines have been imposing ever more demanding challenges associated with effective heat removal from the machine composite structure, with multiple localised and non-homogenous heat sources. It is important to note that balancing both generated power losses (heat), and available heat removal is essential for successful implementation of a specific machine design. The existing examples of advanced motor cooling offer a more targeted approach for removing heat directly or indirectly from the individual heat sources, e.g. direct winding oil spray cooling, forced air rotor cooling, and indirect stator-winding heat exchanger cooling, stator-winding heat guide transport. Some of the concepts originate from high-power and high-efficiency electrical machines for power generation, others are enabled by the developments in new materials and manufacturing techniques. It is evident that a more focused thermal management aiming at specific heat sources is the most effective. Here, the use of additive manufacturing, highly integrated heat exchangers, multi-functional composite materials and phase change heat transport and heat storage are some of the solutions, which have already shown a great promise for the next generation of IMDs.

VL  - 32
IS  - 4
SP  - 474-481
AB  - The potential to liberate steam production capacity for power generation has been assessed using actual energy consumption data and the recorded seasonal consumption fluctuations for a kraft pulp mill. The revenues from power production are compared with possible energy savings, achieved through enhancement of the process efficiency using an absorption heat pump (AHP). Bunker oil, wood bark and black liquor, the fuels used, have very different costs and heating values. The net present value (NPV) was used with a simple payback time (SPB) for the comparison of three cases: (i) power production from liberated steam capacity using a cogeneration unit, (ii) maximised energy savings using an AHP and (iii) power production combined with heat upgrading and cold production using a trigeneration unit. The results show economic viability of all options investigated. The stand-alone AHP achieves the shortest SPB time, whereas the trigeneration option reaches the highest NPV and therefore the best overall economics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Entropy Analysis of Temperature Swing Adsorption for CO2 Capture Using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Method
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
AB  - Carbon capture by adsorption is supposed to be an effective method to reduce CO2 emissions, among which Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) can utilize low-grade thermal energy even from renewable energy source. At present, TSA technology still has several challenges to be practical application, such as intensive energy-consumption and low energy-efficiency. Thermodynamics could be a powerful method to explore the energy conversion mechanism of TSA, among which entropy analysis could further provide a clear picture on the irreversible loss, even with a possible strategy of energy-efficient improvement. Based on the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the entropy analysis of TSA cycle is conducted, using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The physical model and conservation equations are established and calculation methods for entropy generation are presented as well. The entropy generation of each process in cycle is analyzed, and the influence from the main parameters of desorption process is presented with optimization analysis. Finally, the performance of the cycle with regeneration is compared with that of the cycle without regeneration, and the method of reducing the entropy generation is obtained as well. This paper provides possible directions of performance improvement of TSA cycle with regards on energy utilization efficiency and the reduction of irreversible loss.

VL  - 20
IS  - 6
SP  - 723-740
AB  - Dietary restriction (DR) is a potent forerunner in aging studies capable of influencing lifespan and improving health in various model organisms even in their old age. Despite the importance of protein and carbohydrates in the diet (regulation of fecundity and body maintenance respectively), different ratio based combinations of these components has played a major role in lifespan extension studies. In spite of differences existing in dietary protocols across laboratories, diet manipulations have evolved as a major area of research in Drosophila lifespan studies, prominently shedding light on the multi-faceted process over the last two decades. Here, we review various advances and technicalities involved in understanding the DR-mediated lifespan alongside discussing the pros and cons of various existing approaches/diets used across labs. The current review also focuses on the importance of life-stage specific DR implementation and their influence on the life-history traits including lifespan and fecundity, by taking examples of results from different studies comprising diet dilution, calorie restriction, protein restriction, carbohydrate: protein ratios and the modulations in various minor diet components. We thereby intend to gather the major advances made in these fields alongside reviewing the practical implementations that need to be made to get a better view of the DR-mediated lifespan studies.

TI  - Mesothelial cell CSF1 sustains peritoneal macrophage proliferation
VL  - 49

SP  - 2012-2018
AB  - Macrophages play a central role during infection, inflammation and tissue homeostasis maintenance. Macrophages have been identified in all organs and their core transcriptomic signature and functions differ from one tissue to another. Interestingly, macrophages have also been identified in the peritoneal cavity and these cells have been extensively used as a model for phagocytosis, efferocytosis and polarization. Peritoneal macrophages are involved in B-cell IgA production, control of inflammation and wound healing following thermal-induced liver surface injury. These cells presumably require and interact with the omentum, where milky spot stromal cells have been proposed to secrete CSF1 (colony stimulating factor 1). Peritoneal macrophages depend on CSF1 for their generation and survival, but the identity of CSF1 producing cells inside the large peritoneal cavity remains unknown. Here we investigated peritoneal macrophage localization and their interaction with mesothelial cells, the major cell type predicted to secrete CSF1. Our data revealed that mesothelial cells produce membrane bound and secreted CSF1 that both sustain peritoneal macrophage growth.

TI  - Microclimate drives intraspecific thermal specialization: conservation perspectives in freshwater habitats
VL  - 9
AB  - Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.

VL  - 35

SP  - 192-195
AB  - Pairs of platinum mesh or graphite fiber-based electrodes, one embedded in marine sediment (anode), the other in proximal seawater (cathode), have been used to harvest low-level power from natural, microbe established, voltage gradients at marine sediment-seawater interfaces in laboratory aquaria. The sustained power harvested thus far has been on the order of 0.01 W/m(2) of electrode geometric area but is dependent on electrode design, sediment composition, and temperature. It is proposed that the sediment/anode-seawater/cathode configuration constitutes a microbial fuel cell in which power results from the net oxidation of sediment organic matter by dissolved seawater oxygen. Considering typical sediment organic carbon contents, typical fluxes of additional reduced carbon by sedimentation to sea floors < 1000 m deep, and the proven viability of dissolved seawater oxygen as an oxidant for power generation by seawater batteries, it is calculated that optimized power supplies based on the phenomenon demonstrated here could power oceanographic instruments deployed for routine long-term monitoring operations in the coastal ocean.

TI  - Evaluation of chum salmon fishery performance using Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock recruitment approaches in a Bayesian framework
VL  - 49
SP  - 1417-1433
AB  - To improve the ability of managers to make appropriate decisions, we analyzed chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta data from central British Columbia and evaluated alternative escapement goals and the potential impacts of environmental change on Fishery performance. Fishery performance was expressed in terms of mean catch and the probability of annual catches exceeding 100,000 fish. We investigated Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationships and tested if environmental variation as reflected by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) improved these relationships. Uncertainties associated with stock-recruitment model parameters were evaluated using a Bayesian approach. Posterior distributions of the parameters were generated using Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedures. Our data set was relatively informative as reflected by the well defined probability distributions of the stock-recruitment parameters. Fishery performance was assessed through stochastic projections over three generations (12 years) under various scenarios of escapement goals and climate conditions. Sea surface temperature anomalies significantly improved both models and recruitments were higher for chum salmon that entered the sea during cold years than in warm years. Recruitments tended to be more correlated with SSTA from north of the point of fry sea entry than from where fry actually entered the sea. Using a Ricker model, an escapement goal of roughly 100,000-150,000 spawners (depending of the climate scenario) yielded the highest probability of a projected yearly catch of at least 100,000 chum, while with the Beverton-Holt model, only similar to 45,000 spawners were needed. Since the Ricker model was insensitive to the type of priors and is more precautionary than the Beverton-Holt, we conclude that it is the most appropriate.

VL  - 99
IS  - 5
SP  - 767-775
AB  - Recent theoretical studies of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) accretion have shown that the density differences between silicate melt and solid phases and between fertile and residual mantle may be important controls on the upward flow of upper mantle and separation of melt from the upwelling matrix. Both compositional and thermal buoyancy may play an important role. To assess quantitatively the magnitude of these effects, we have compiled the available data for calculating densities of silicate melts and solid phases as a function of composition, temperature (1000-1500-degrees-C), and pressure (1 atm to any pressure where the solid phases of interest remain stable). We include measured and calculated values of thermal expansion and compressibility for both solids and liquids. Our calculations for mantle material undergoing decompression-induced melting show that density differences between instantaneous melt and residual solids increase toward the surface, implying an increasing melt migration rate with continuing upwelling and melting. However, the density difference is significantly less than the value of approximately 0.5 g-cm-3 commonly assumed in theoretical models. In agreement with previous studies, we also find that residual mantle is less dense than unmelted mantle; however, using realistic pressures for MORB generation, the difference is small.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SP  - 57-67
AB  - The voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSC) are complex membrane proteins responsible for generation and propagation of the electrical signals through the brain, the skeletal muscle and the heart. The levels of sodium channels affect behavior and physical activity. This is illustrated by the maleless mutant allele (mle(napts)) in Drosophila, where the decreased levels of voltage-gated Na+ channels cause temperature-sensitive paralysis. Here, we report that mle(napts) mutant flies exhibit developmental lethality, decreased fecundity and increased neurodegeneration. The negative effect of decreased levels of Na+ channels on development and ts-paralysis was more pronounced at 18 and 29 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, suggesting particular sensitivity of the mle(napts) flies to temperatures above and below normal environmental conditions. Similarly, longevity of mle(napts) flies was unexpectedly short at 18 and 29 degrees C compared with flies heterozygous for the mle(napts) mutation. Developmental lethality and neurodegeneration of mle(napts) flies was partially rescued by increasing the dosage of para, confirming a vital role of Na+ channels in development, longevity and neurodegeneration of flies and their adaptation to temperatures

TI  - Geographic variation in the upper thermal limits of an intertidal snail: implications for climate envelope models
VL  - 388
SP  - 137-146
AB  - Although climate envelope models are used increasingly to predict the response of species to climate change, these models may perform poorly when species are comprised of locally adapted populations with differing environmental tolerances. Despite this concern, little is known about how tolerance traits vary across a species' geographic range. In this study, we tested whether the upper thermal limits of a direct- developing intertidal snail, Nucella canaliculata, varied among populations distributed along the northeastern Pacific coast. Snails from 7 sites in central California, northern California, and Oregon (USA) were reared through 2 generations in a common laboratory environment to minimize the potential influence of field acclimatization and other non-genetic effects. Laboratory assays of acute lethal temperature tolerance (LT50) indicated that newly hatched N. canaliculata from central California were less heat tolerant than their conspecifics from Oregon. These differences in upper thermal limits likely have a genetic basis and are consistent with a mosaic of potential thermal stress in rocky intertidal habitats along the northeastern Pacific coast. In particular, some northern sites experience longer exposures to stressful midday low tides than southern sites, due to variation among regions in the timing of low tides. Persistent regional differences in tidal regimes, climate, and other environmental factors may act as selective forces that influence the physiology of intertidal species with broad latitudinal ranges. The resulting geographic distribution of thermally tolerant genotypes may be spatially complex, and may thus alter predictions regarding the effects of climate change on local extinctions and species' geographic range shifts.

AB  - The use of renewable fuels, such as the biodiesel, can ease the demand of fossil fuel for the power generation and transportation fields in rural area. In this work, the performance impact of the application of castor oil biodiesel is evaluated with an automotive and a stationary diesel engine. The application of B20 and B10 biodiesel blends and pre-heated net biodiesel is considered. The viability of the employment of B10 and B20 blends to mobility and power generation was observed from dynamometric bench tests, where this blends performed similar to fossil diesel. With the pre-heated net biodiesel, however, a brake torque loss and a specific consumption increase were observed with relation to diesel fuel.

In the present study, various syngas components produced from coal gasification were combined to produce a simulated mixed gas, which was fed into a pressurized gas turbine combustion test rig to determine the combustion characteristics. A scaled model of the 7EA combustor from GE was used to conduct a basic comparative study on the emission trend (NOx), exhaust gas temperature distribution according to the combustor pressure, syngas composition and dilution ratio at the fuel side. The major findings were that modification of the empirical formula for pressure affects NOx emission and nitrogen dilution ratio affects the temperature profile uniformity on the fuel side.

TI  - Thermoacoustically driven triboelectric nanogenerator: Combining thermoacoustics and nanoscience
VL  - 111
IS  - 15
AB  - A thermoacoustic heat engine (TAHE) is a type of regenerative heat engine that converts external heat into mechanical power in the form of an acoustic wave with no moving mechanical components. One significant application of the TAHE is the generation of electricity by coupling an acoustic-to-electric conversion unit such as a linear motor or a piezoelectric ceramic assembly. However, present-day conversion technologies have considerable drawbacks, including structural complexity, high cost, and low reliability. The advent of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offers an alternative means to overcoming these shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a thermoacoustically driven TENG (TA-TENG) that continuously harvests external heat. A test rig involving a standing-wave TAHE and a contact-separation mode TENG was fabricated to demonstrate this concept. Currently, the TA-TENG produces a maximum output voltage of 10V and a corresponding output power of 0.008 mu W with a load of 400M Omega, demonstrating the viability of this hybrid combination for electricity generation.

TI  - Hypoxia Causes Transgenerational Impairment of Ovarian Development and Hatching Success in Fish
VL  - 53
IS  - 7
SP  - 3917-3928
AB  - Hypoxia is a pressing environmental problem in both marine and freshwater ecosystems globally, and this problem will be further exacerbated by global warming in the coming decades. Recently, we reported that hypoxia can cause transgenerational impairment of sperm quality and quantity in fish (in F0, F1, and F2 generations) through DNA methylome modifications. Here, we provide evidence that female fish (Oryzias melastigma) exposed to hypoxia exhibit reproductive impairments (follicle atresia and retarded oocyte development), leading to a drastic reduction in hatching success in the F2 generation of the transgenerational group, although they have never been exposed to hypoxia. Further analyses show that the observed transgenerational impairments in ovarian functions are related to changes in the DNA methylation and expression pattern of two gene clusters that are closely associated with stress-induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. The observed epigenetic and transgenerational alterations suggest that hypoxia may pose to the sustainability of natural fish populations.

AB  - In this study, a solar parabolic trough collector combined with a Kalina cycle, multi-stage flash desalination unit, a proton exchange membrane electrolyser for hydrogen production, and a micro-combined cooling, heating, and power system is presented. Systematic energy, exergy, and exergo-environmental evaluation are used to analyse the viability of the integrated systems as the most effective approach for performance assessment of integrated systems. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system is observed to be 50.51% and 3.27% respectively. The rate of exergy destruction of each component and the overall cycle is determined where the parabolic trough collector is shown to have an exergy destruction rate of 234.4 kW, which is the highest among all the components. The performance of the proposed systems is also checked through a parametric study of the different key parameters.

TI  - Environmental and health consequences of shore power for vessels calling at major ports in India
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
AB  - To reduce local air pollution, many ports in developed countries require berthed ships to use shore-based electricity instead of burning diesel to meet their electricity requirement for loads such as lights, cargo-handling equipment, and air conditioning. The benefits of this strategy in developing countries remain understudied. Based on government data for all major ports in India, we find that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power reduces hoteling emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) by 88%; SO2 by 39%; NO (x) by 85%; but increases CO2 emissions by 12%. Switching from low-sulfur fuel reduces hoteling emissions of PM2.5 by 46% and NO (x) by 84% but increases SO2 emissions by 240% and CO2 emissions by 17%. The lifetime cost savings from the switch to electricity are $73 M for high-sulfur fuel and $370 M for low-sulfur fuel. We estimate that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power might avoid at most a couple of dozen premature deaths each year, whereas switching from low-sulfur fuel could lead to a slight increase in premature mortality. Therefore, policymakers must first clean up power generation for shore power to be a viable strategy to improve air quality in Indian port cities.

VL  - 35
IS  - 2
SP  - 84-110
AB  - The present paper constitutes a first contribution of a series devoted to the importance of fundamental evolutionary biology for applied purposes in acarology. It presents the main life history traits which play a role in the control of pests and in our knowledge of potential of mites as biological control agents. The mites, or Acari, constitue a group of minute Arachnida which exhibits one of the highest biodiversity among Arthropods. Originating from the soil, they colonised then almost all the niches of the biosphere, including fresh and salt waters. In addition, contrarily to the other Arachnida, which are all predators, mites adopted a large range of feeding habits: saprophagy, fungivory, phytopagy, carnivory and parasitic nutrition. In the course of their evolution they adapted to numerous human settlements. As a consequence, mites are involved in many economical activities: public health, veterinary medicine, forestry, stored products and agriculture. The effectiveness of the dispersal strategies developed by these small wingless animals - anemochory, phoresy and parasitic infestation - is the prevalent reason of their success in colonizing so diverse environments. Parthenogenesis - thelytoky, arrhenotoky and pseudoarrhenotoky - play also a major role in the dynamics of scattered populations and the foundation of new colonies, even in perturbed conditions. The sex ratio biased in favour of dispersant females, is an important feature of the effectiveness of the predatory biocontrol agents. The genetic characteristics of arrhenotokous and pseudoarrhenotokous mites play a role in pesticide resistance. One can observe a general trend towards abbreviated postembryonic developments in the less conservative forms. This, associated to the other demographic assessments, especially the intrinsic rate of increase, r(m), are widely studied in pests and biocontrol agents. All these life traits in the dynamics of the mite pests, but also in the predator/prey models and the feasibility of mass rearing of beneficial mites.

TI  - Rotifers from diapausing, fertilized eggs: Unique features and emergence
VL  - 49
IS  - 4
SP  - 1341-1354
AB  - Sexual reproduction in cyclically parthenogenetic rotifers results in the production of diapausing, fertilized (resting) eggs, which can survive for decades in sediment egg banks. Stem females hatching from these eggs can differ from genetically identical ones produced in subsequent parthenogenetic generations. Differences involve the inhibition of sexual reproduction, which may persist for many parthenogenetic generations; reduced morphology (apterous Polyarthra, shorter-spined Brachionus); and larger stores of lipid. These features of stem females may facilitate colonization by favoring population growth via female parthenogenesis and by decreasing food requirements for survival and reproduction. Fertilized eggs in dried sediments probably hatch soon after being flooded by rising water levels. Eggs in permanently submerged sediments may be in environments that inhibit hatching (e.g., darkness, low water temperature, low dissolved oxygen) and hatch only when brought to the sediment surface or resuspended into the water column by currents or bioturbation. Laboratory experiments show that the hatching of diapausing, fertilized eggs can require light and temperatures suitable for population development or specific changes in temperature consistent with a new growing season. The limited data that exist on their emergence from fertilized eggs in natural systems come from sediment traps, from the occurrence in the water column of apterous Polyarthra or empty egg shells, and from calculations of negative mortality rates of planktonic populations. Fertilized eggs often hatch at the beginning of the growth season but may continue to hatch intermittently thereafter. The extremely high genotypic diversity of some natural rotifer populations indicates extensive hatching of stem females from the sediment egg bank.

TI  - Cytotoxicity and Anticancer Activity of Donkioporiella mellea on MRC5 (Normal Human Lung) and A549 (Human Lung Carcinoma) Cells Lines
VL  - 2020
AB  - Polypores are mushrooms which are rich in bioactivities and for generations, they have been widely used as herbal remedies. Despite their significant importance in treatments of various health issues, only a few local species have been reported for their pharmacological potentials. The present study was carried out to establish cytotoxicity potentials of Donkioporiella mellea, a local polypore species collected from forested areas in Malaysia at cellular levels on normal human lung (MRC5) and human lung carcinoma (A549) cell lines. Survival and inhibition rates were analyzed by 3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y-l)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) while monitoring changes on cellular shapes by inverted phase contrast microscopy. Survival rates of MRC5 cells were observed to be significantly higher than A549 after treatments with various concentrations of polypore extracts. MRC5 cells showed excellence in survival performance when treated with hot and cold aqueous extracts. Cold aqueous extract showed higher cytotoxicity activities compared to hot aqueous extract (p<0.0001) with inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 414.29 mu g/ml and >1000 mu g/ml, respectively. Treatments with tamoxifen as a control exhibited necrotic features in both cell lines. The results suggest that D. mellea possesses pharmacological potentials that can be utilized for human consumption as a new bioresource alternative, thus encouraging research advancement in mycological and nutraceutical studies.

VL  - 45
IS  - 1
SP  - 721-737
AB  - Green ammonia production is facing increasing interest on a global scale as a hydrogen carrier for power generation as well as fertilizer for food production. The conventional Haber-Bosch method for ammonia synthesis is energy demanding, requires high purity hydrogen, and is based on fossil fuels. A preliminary techno-economic model for electrochemical ammonia synthesis at near ambient pressure using feed rates of 32 metric ton/day for hydrogen and 135 metric ton/day for nitrogen is presented in this study. Various pathways using different methods for nitrogen generation and hydrogen production were investigated to gain insight into added energy savings per metric ton of ammonia. Electrochemical synthesis using electrolysis for hydrogen and cryogenic nitrogen was found to be a potentially viable pathway for green ammonia. The profitability metrics including discounted cash flow rate of return, net present value and discounted payback period were estimated to be 8%, $40 MM, and 4-6 years respectively for this pathway. The cost of electricity, conversion rate, and conversion efficiency dominate the tonnage cost of ammonia and were used to assess the feasibility of the model. A life cycle assessment was also conducted to assess the environmental impact of a well to product ammonia process. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Solar-Powered Atmospheric Water Harvesting Using Different Glazing Materials in the Tropical Built Environment: An Experimental Study
VL  - 15
IS  - 9
AB  - Water scarcity is a global issue, and its severity is expected to worsen in the near future, prompting further efforts to find new sources of freshwater. Solar-Powered Atmospheric Water Harvesting (SPAWH) is a promising passive approach for atmospheric water generation. This study aims to examine the thermal performance of different glazing materials and water production in SPAWH. The research consists of two phases: a laboratory test of various glazing materials and an experimental study to assess system efficiency in producing water in the tropics. The preliminary results indicated that glass demonstrated better thermal performance than acrylic in the lab, with higher thermal conductivity and less heat loss. The experimental findings showed that the maximum water produced by the proposed SPAWH (60 cm length, 60 cm width and 30 cm height) placed on a 30 degrees tilt angle using glass (3 mm) and acrylic (3 mm) was 0.61 L/m(2)/day and 0.44 L/m(2)/day, respectively. The cost analysis revealed that produced water costs $0.18/kg for glass and $0.40/kg for acrylic, respectively. Atmospheric water could be harvested using SPAWH in the tropics, which would help to provide new opportunities for sustainable water supplies and development in these regions.

AB  - Miniaturization is the central theme in modern fabrication technology. Many of the components used in modern products are becoming smaller and smaller. The applicability of the standard lithographic technologies to processing the new functional materials is crucial for their successful wide implementation in practice. Recently we have reported experimental design and test of the new generation for nanomecanical devices like nano-tweezers based on original bilayer Ti2NiCu/Pt composite structures. In the present paper it is demonstrated that standard ion beam nano-fabrication technology is quit suitable for full cycle of production operational stages of practical nano-tweezers production. The technological experiments were done on realizing by usage of a novel focused ion beam instrument Raith ionLiNE (TM) device. This device is a novel focused ion beam instrument for low dose nanolithography and nano-fabrication. ionLiNE (TM) Raith was applied for experimental composite nano-tweezers production on the base of Ti2NiCu/W with length - 30 mu m, gap width 0.9 mu. The tests showed high quality of reproduction and long term operation under thermal control at temperature change only 14 K

TI  - Effects of Elevated CO2 on the Fitness of Three Successive Generations of Lipaphis erysimi
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
AB  - Simple Summary Global warming caused by the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is becoming a major environmental issue. Lipaphis erysimi is one of the most damaging pests of cruciferous crops worldwide, and L. erysimi has strong adaptability to the environment and reproductive capacity. The age-stage, two-sex life table is currently used by many researchers in place of the traditional age-specific life table, providing many details such as fitness and potential damage. In this study, the individual fitness and population dynamics parameters of three successive generations of L. erysimi were analyzed using the age-stage, two-sex life table. The results show that a high CO2 concentration had a cumulative effect on the survival rate and fecundity of L. erysimi, and elevated CO2 had a negative effect on the individual fitness parameters of L. erysimi. The life expectancy (e(xj)) is significantly lower in elevated CO2 than that in ambient CO2 treatment in the three successive generations, indicating that L. erysimi was more sensitive to CO2 concentration and the life of L. erysimi was shortened under elevated CO2. Additionally, we can find that elevated CO2 has a short-term effect on the population parameters, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) in L. erysimi. Through the data from this experiment, we believe that the individual and population fitness of L. erysimi will be decreased under elevated CO2, which indicates that the damage caused by L. erysimi may be reduced in the future with increasing CO2 levels. To assess the effect of elevated CO2 on the development, fecundity, and population dynamic parameters of L. erysimi, the age-stage, two-sex life table was used to predict the individual fitness and population parameters of three successive generations of L. erysimi in this study. The results show that a significantly longer total pre-adult stage before oviposition (TPOP) was observed in the third generation compared with the first generation of L. erysimi under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment. The fecundity is significantly lower in the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment than that in the 400 mu L/L CO2 treatment in the third generation of L. erysimi, which indicates that elevated CO2 had a negative effect on the individual fitness parameters of L. erysimi. Additionally, the life expectancy (e(xj)) is significantly lower under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment than that under the 400 mu L/L CO2 treatment in the three successive generations. A significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were found in the second generation compared with those in the first and third generations of L. erysimi under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment. Moreover, significantly lower r and lambda were observed under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment compared with those under the 400 mu L/L and 600 mu L/L CO2 treatments in the first generation of L. erysimi, which indicates that elevated CO2 has a short-term effect on the population parameters (r and lambda) of L. erysimi. Our experiment can provide the data for the comprehensive prevention and control of L. erysimi in the future with increasing CO2 levels.

VL  - 141

SP  - 471-485
AB  - For a number of generations, we followed the frequency, performance and fecundity of an initial mixture (50:50) of triazine resistant (R) and susceptible (S) but otherwise near-isogenic lines of Brassica rapa (for 3 yr) and of Chenopodium album (for 2 yr) in neighbouring experimental garden plots, which differed in aspect (north-facing versus south-facing), shading, and transparent cover from precipitation. Each of eight treatments was replicated four times per species. Seed from each plot was kept separate and sown back in its plot of origin to provide the next generation. For both Brassica and Chenopodium, R frequency changed between generations. In Brassica R frequency declined consistently from an initial 0.5 and, after 2 yr, R plants had disappeared in all replicates in two treatments and averaged <0.126 in the remaining treatments. However, R frequencies in the smaller second generation samples in each year were less consistent. In Chenopodium R frequency increased consistently from an initial 0.5 in all treatments and replicates during 1995 to average 0.772 on south-facing sites and 0.675 on north-facing sites. However, in 1996 Chenopodium R frequency did not change significantly from that in 1995 for any treatment. Brassica S plants were more fecund that R plants, except in shaded conditions, and south-facing plots produced significantly more S seeds than north-facing plots. Both Brassica plants and plots were more productive in 1996 than in 1995. By contrast, Chenopodium was much less productive in 1996, a season with more climatic extremes between plots than 1995. In 1995, R plants were more fecund than S plants in south-facing plots and in covered conditions, but this difference was not detected in 1996. South-facing Chenopodium plots were more productive than north-facing plots in 1995, but the reverse was the case in 1996. Cover resulted in an increase in seed production in Chenopodium on south-facing plots in 1995, but a decline in 1996. We conclude that st lection might act against triazine-resistant plants in B. rapa under the climatic conditions in the UK, but in C. album, which is more susceptible to extreme conditions of light and water stress, triazine-resistant phenotypes might predominate in lo iv stress cool moist conditions. We suggest that a relationship might exist between the overall climatic tolerance of a species, and climate thresholds beyond which herbicide-resistant phenotypes might spread. Thus, in the absence of herbicide, it is not inevitable that the frequency of R phenotypes will decline in field conditions.

AB  - 1 Taxocenes - monophyletic ecological assemblages - are a key focus of macroecology. Abundance (individuals per area) is a basic property of taxocenes but has received less attention than diversity, although the two are probably related. Abundance reflects a taxocene's ability to harvest and sequester available energy and divide it among individuals. This paper explores how two properties of all taxocenes - trophic makeup and taxonomic level (e.g. genus, tribe, subfamily, family...)- may contribute to patterns of local abundance at geographical scales. 2 Forty-nine ground ant taxocenes, in habitats ranging from New World deserts to rain forests, were surveyed along a three-orders of magnitude productivity gradient using transects of 30 1-m(2) quadrats at each site. Abundance - the number of nests per transect - varied over two orders of magnitude. 3 Over 80% of the genera collected were omnivores. However, herbivore, omnivore, and predator taxa were added to ant taxocenes in roughly 1 order of magnitude steps up the productivity gradient. Specialist detritivores were added last. 4 Net primary productivity and mean monthly temperature both consistently entered regression models predicting abundance. However, while productivity was the dominant predictor of abundance for higher taxa (families, subfamilies), temperature was the dominant predictor of abundance for lower taxa (tribes, genera). The answer to the question 'What regulates the abundance of a taxocene?' is thus sensitive to the taxonomic level of analysis. 5 These data support the following scenario. Lower taxa are abiotic specialists given the insufficient number of genomes and generations required for the exploration of the entire abiotic envelope. Higher taxa, in contrast, consist of suites of abiotic specialists arrayed along the entire productivity gradient, with access to productivity everywhere the taxon occurs. If this scenario is true, individual species may respond to global changes in temperature; the higher taxa they belong to may most respond to global changes in productivity.

TI  - Cancer is an adaptation that selects in animals against energy dissipation
VL  - 104
SP  - 104-115
AB  - As cancer usually follows reproduction, it is generally assumed that cancer does not select. Graham has however argued that juvenile cancer, which precedes reproduction, could during evolution have implemented a "cancer selection" that resulted in novel traits "that suppress this juvenile cancer; an example is protection against UV sunlight-induced cancer, required for the emergence of terrestrial animals from the sea. We modify the cancer selection mechanism to the posited "cancer adaptation" mechanism, in which juvenile mortality is enhanced through the diminished care received by juveniles from their (grand) parents when these suffer from cancer in old age. Moreover, it is posited that the cancer adaptation selects against germline "dissipative genes", genes that result in enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer's progression is interpreted as a cascade at increasing scale of repeated amplification of energy dissipation, a cascade involving heat shock, the Warburg effect, the cytokine IL-6, tumours, and hypermetabolism. Disturbance of any physiological process must enhance energy dissipation if the animal remains functioning normally, what explains multi causality, why "everything gives you cancer". The hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes diminished (grand) parental care and dissipation amplification and results in a "selection against enhanced energy dissipation" which gives during evolution the benefit of energy conservation. Due to this benefit, cancer would essentially be an adaptation, and not a genetic disease, as assumed in the "somatic mutation theory". Cancer by somatic mutations is only a side process. The cancer adaptation hypothesis is substantiated by (1) cancer's extancy, (2) the failure of the somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer's initiation by a high temperature, (4) the interpretation of cancer's progression as a thermal process, and (5) the interpretation of tumours as organs that implement thermogenesis. The hypothesis could in principle be verified by monitoring in a population over several generations (1) the presence of dissipative genes, (2) the incidence of cancer, and (3) the beneficial effect of dissipative gene removal by cancer on starvation/famine survival.

VL  - 161

AB  - We used 94 RAPD primers of different nucleotide composition to probe the genomic differences between a highly virulent P. multocida strain and an attenuated vaccine strain derived from the virulent strain after culturing the latter under increasing temperature for 14,400 generations. The GC content of the vaccine strain is significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the virulent strain, contrary to the popular hypothesis of covariation between the GC content and temperature. The frequencies of AA, TA, and TT dinucleotides were higher, and those of AT, GC, and CG dinucleotides were lower, in the vaccine strain than in the virulent strain. A statistic called genomic RAPD entropy is formulated to measure the randomness of the genome, and the genome of the vaccine strain is more random than that of the virulent strain. These differences between the virulent and vaccine strains are interpreted in terms of mutation and selection under increased culturing temperature. A method for estimating substitution rates is developed in the APPENDIX.

VL  - 15
IS  - 1
SP  - 574-583
AB  - It has been broadly accepted worldwide that global warming, indeed, is the greatest threat of the time to the environment. Renewable energy (RE) is expected as a perfect solution to reduce global warming and to endorse sustainable development. Progressive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from increasing energy-intensive industries has eventually caused human civilization to suffer. Realizing the exigency of reducing emissions and simultaneously catering to needs of industries, researchers foresee the RE as the perfect entrant to overcome these challenges. RE provides an effective option for the provision of energy services from the technical point of view while biomass, a major source of energy in the world until before industrialization when fossil fuels become dominant, appears an important renewable source of energy and researches have proven from time to time its viability for large-scale production. Being a widely spread source, biomass offers the execution of decentralized electricity generation gaining importance in liberalized electricity markets. The decentralized power is characterized by generation of electricity nearer to the demand centers, meeting the local energy needs. Researchers envisaged an increasing decentralization of power supply, expected to make a particular contribution to climate protection. This article investigates the progress and challenges for decentralized electricity generation by palm oil biomass according to the overall concept of sustainable development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of a material structure called 'solar foam' with double layered structure of exfoliated graphite flakes and reticulated PU foam for solar steam generation at low solar intensity and keeping the bulk liquid at low temperature with no vacuum. Solar desalination is a one such technology which uses direct sunlight for purification of water at low cost and with less space occupied. This approach requires either costly high optical intensity parabolic reflectors leading to heat loss by the hot bulk liquid and heated surfaces. To decrease these losses new solar receiver concepts such as nano fluids or volumetric receivers have been proposed. But their conversion efficiency is comparatively lower (30%). To harvest solar energy for a broad range of phase-change applications this new structure will be novel approach. Suitable modifications have done to solar still to increase its productivity.

AB  - In this study we investigated the sensitivity of Deinococcus radiodurans to contact-free cold atmospheric plasma treatment as part of a project to establish new efficient procedures for disinfection of inanimate surfaces. The Gram-positive D. radiodurans is one of the most resistant microorganisms worldwide. Stationary phases of D. radiodurans were exposed to cold atmospheric plasma for different time intervals or to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation at dose rates of 0.001-0.0656 J cm(-2), respectively. A methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA) served as control for Gram-positive bacteria. The surface microdischarge plasma technology was used for generation of cold atmospheric plasma. A plasma discharge was ignited using ambient air. Surprisingly, D. radiodurans was sensitive to the cold atmospheric plasma treatment in the same range as the MRSA strain. Survival of both bacteria decreased with increasing plasma exposure times up to 6 log(10) cycles (> 99.999 %) within 20 s of plasma treatment. In contrast, UVC radiation of both bacteria demonstrated that D. radiodurans was more resistant to UVC treatment than MRSA. Cold atmospheric plasma seems to be a promising tool for industrial and clinical purposes where time-saving is a critical point to achieve efficient disinfection of inanimate surfaces and where protection from corrosive materials is needed.

TI  - The Genetic and Transcriptional Basis of Short and Long Term Adaptation across Multiple Stresses in Escherichia coli
VL  - 34
IS  - 3
SP  - 707-717
AB  - Microbes exhibit short and long term responses when exposed to challenging environmental conditions. To what extent these responses are correlated, what their evolutionary potential is and how they translate to cross-stress fitness is still unclear. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the response of Escherichia coli populations to four abiotic stresses (n-butanol, osmotic, acidic, and oxidative) and their combinations by performing genome-scale transcriptional analysis and growth profiling. We performed an analysis of their cross-stress behavior which identified 15 cases of cross-protection and one case of cross vulnerability. To elucidate the evolutionary potential of stress responses to individual stresses and stress combinations, we re-sequenced E. coli populations evolved in those four environments for 500 generations. We developed and applied a network-driven method that integrates mutations and differential expression to identify core and stress-specific gene communities that are likely to have a phenotypic impact. Our results suggest that beyond what is expected from the general stress response mechanisms, cross-stress behavior arises both from common pathways, several including metal ion binding and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and stress-specific expression programs. The stress-specific dependences uncovered, argue that cross-stress behavior is ubiquitous and central to understanding microbial physiology under stressful conditions.

TI  - Refertilization-driven destabilization of subcontinental mantle and the importance of initial lithospheric thickness for the fate of continents
VL  - 409
SP  - 225-231
AB  - Continents are underlain by thick, cold thermal boundary layers. Thermal contraction should render these boundary layers negatively buoyant and unstable; this is why old, cold oceanic lithospheres subduct. However, the ancient lithospheric roots of many continents appear to have existed for billions of years. In the common view, this preservation is due to the fact that the thermal boundary layers are compositionally distinct from the ambient mantle in that they are highly melt-depleted and dehydrated; the former provides positive buoyancy and the latter provides strength. Here, we show using mantle xenoliths that the Precambrian South China Block originally was underlain by highly depleted mantle, but has been refertilized via silicate melts generated from the asthenosphere. It is now more fertile than the ambient convecting mantle and is intrinsically denser by more than 1.5%. Achieving sufficient melt generation for refertilization is only possible if the lithosphere is thin enough to provide "headspace" for decompression melting. Thus, continental boundary layers thinner than the maximum depth of melting should experience refertilization, whereas thicker continents would altogether suppress melting and hence the potential for refertilization. We propose that refertilization, once initiated, will destabilize the base of the continent; this in turn will increase the amount of "headspace" and promote further refertilization, resulting in a positive feedback that could culminate in lithospheric destruction. By contrast, continents that are thick enough may not experience significant refertilization. This suggests that initial lithospheric thickness, as well as lithospheric composition, may be important for defining the fate of continents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The application of simulated NPP data in improving the assessment of the spatial distribution of biomass in Europe
VL  - 33
IS  - 4
SP  - 712-720
AB  - Efficient integration of increasing shares of renewable resources into electricity supply requires information about spatial and temporal variations in the availability of energy carriers. Regarding biomass, the spatial variation is crucial for the estimation of the regional potential and costs of biomass for electricity generation. Described in this paper is the examination of the applicability of net primary productivity data for improving the quality of a high resolution inventory of potentials of biomass energy. The net primary productivity is simulated with remotely sensed input data taking into account site-specific information such as precipitation, irradiation and temperature. For the examples of forest wood and surplus straw, two different methods of inventorying were applied and compared: 1) disaggregating biomass potentials derived from statistical crop data using a land cover map and 2 additionally weighting the distribution with the net primary productivity, We found that in the case of surplus straw, this method yielded better results than only disaggregating the potential with the land cover data. No clear conclusions could be drawn from the statistical test applied regarding forest wood, because the sample size of reference values was too small. Based on a critical reflection of the data which is input to the NPP simulation, it was concluded that the distribution of forest wood potentials should not be weighted with the NPP data unless more appropriate satellite input data is available.

TI  - Identification and analysis of impact factors on the economic feasibility of wind energy investments
VL  - 45
IS  - 3
SP  - 3671-3697
AB  - The growing energy demand in the world and the concern for environmentally damaging energy sources have led to an increased interest in seeking alternative renewable energy sources, such as wind energy. Furthermore, choosing effective locations for wind power plants has become a key issue in project planning. However, prior to implementation, such projects should be confirmed as economically viable. This article is a systematic review of the literature carried out with the aim to identify the main factors that impact the economic feasibility of wind energy investments. The search was performed in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) electronic database, from which 120 papers were extracted after a selection process, and were analyzed individually. As a result of the review analysis, 23 factors that have an impact on feasibility analysis were identified and organized in five categories: location (surface roughness, turbine location), economic (investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, avoided energy cost, depreciation, land rent), political (interest rates and taxes, energy sales price, inflation, financing conditions), climatic (wind speed, air density, temperature, air pressure), and technical (turbine height, installed wind power, lifetime, efficiency, rotor diameter, operation time, number of turbine blades, construction time). These factors can directly impact the cost of capital and/or energy production, affecting the economic viability of wind farms. In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in publications about economic feasibility of wind investments. The wind investments growth has been accompanied by financial studies about this subject. This study provides insights on the main variables used in wind energy feasibility studies. The results may assist researchers and investors to identify the key parameters that are being examined in the literature, and to evaluate which ones should be considered in their study to ensure a sustainable development of power generation through the wind source.

TI  - A short review of pike ecology
VL  - 601
SP  - 5-16
AB  - A brief review is provided in some advances in understanding the ecology of pike Esox lucius Linnaeus over the last 10 years. Based on long-term studies and manipulative, often short-term experiments (laboratory, field and mesocosms) several established theories have been supported, as well as new concepts developed. Despite their wide distribution pike show low levels of polymorphism and divergence indicative of a recent common ancestral population. Recent genetic studies, however, indicate a single refugium in North America compared to several refugia in Europe. Pike are found in rivers, lakes and weakly saline waters. Variables such as growth and mortality are mainly affected by factors such as temperature, water transparency, productivity, availability of prey and density of pike and other predators. In choice of habitat pike have been shown to support the ideal free-distribution theory. The importance of macrophyte habitat in the life history of pike has been reconfirmed and pike have been shown to be flexible in response to water clarity. Pike are extremely 'plastic' in choice of prey types, prey size and in response to prey behaviour (e.g. they are unaffected by shoal size). Predation by pike not only affects abundance and biomass of prey (including younger and smaller pike through cannibalism which plays a major role in population dynamics, other fishes and invertebrates) but also evolution and adaptation of their morphology (in particular body shape) and behaviours. There appears to be no relationship between stock and recruitment. Recruitment is influenced by several abiotic factors in lakes and rivers. Pike play a major role in structuring freshwater communities and have been used in stocking programmes to improve water quality (biomanipulation). Many new concepts have been developed in pike behaviour in maximizing these stocking programmes both in biomanipulation and fisheries management. Despite many recent advances in understanding the ecology of pike, particularly at the individual level, developments in quantifying and modelling the role of pike as a top predator in large ecosystems have been limited, probably due to the difficulties of sampling natural populations.

TI  - Analysis of longevity in Chordata identifies species with exceptional longevity among taxa and points to the evolution of longer lifespans
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SP  - 329-343
AB  - Animals have a considerable variation in their longevity. This fundamental life-history trait is shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic mortality pressures, influenced by multiple parameters including ecological variables and mode-of-life traits. Here, we examined the distribution of maximum age at multiple taxonomic ranks (class, order and family) in Chordata, and identified species with exceptional longevity within various taxa. We used a curated dataset of maximum longevity of animals from AnAge database, containing a total of 2542 chordates following our filtering criteria. We determined shapes of maximum age distributions at class, order and family taxonomic ranks, and calculated skewness values for each distribution, in R programming environment. We identified species with exceptional longevity compared to other species belonging to the same taxa, based on our definition of outliers. We collected data on ecological variables and mode-of-life traits which might possibly contribute, at least in part, to the exceptional lifespans of certain chordates. We found that 23, 12 and 4 species have exceptional longevity when we grouped chordates by their class, order and family, respectively. Almost all distributions of maximum age among taxa were positively skewed (towards increased longevity), possibly showing the emergence of longer lifespans in contrast to shorter lifespans, through the course of evolution. However, potential biases in the collection of data should be taken into account. Most of the identified species in the current study have not been previously studied in the context of animal longevity. Our analyses point that certain chordates may have evolved to have longer lifespans compared to other species belonging to the same taxa, and that among taxa, outliers in terms of maximum age have always longer lifespans, not shorter. Future research is required to understand how and why increased longevity have arose in certain species.

TI  - Aging is an adaptation that selects in animals against disruption of homeostasis
VL  - 119
SP  - 68-78
AB  - During evolution, Muller's ratchet permanently generates deleterious germline mutations that eventually must be defused by selection. It seems widely held that cancer and aging-related diseases (ARDs) cannot contribute to this germline gene selection because they tail reproduction and thus occur too late, at the end of the life cycle. Here we posit however that by lessening the offspring's survival by proxy through diminishing parental care, they can still contribute to the selection. The hypothesis in detail: The widespread occurrence of aging in animals suggests that it is an adaptation. But to what benefit? Aging seems to have only drawbacks. In humans, ARDs cause today almost all mortality; they include heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease and cancer. Compensation seems unthinkable. For cancer, the author proposed in a previous study a benefit to the species: purifying selection against deleterious germline genes that when expressed enhance intracellular energy dissipation. This multicausal energy dissipation, posited as the universal origin of cancer initiation, relates to cellular heat generation, disrupted metabolism, and inflammation. The organism reproduces during cancer's dormancy, and when approaching its end of life, the onset of cancer is accelerated in proportion to the cancer-initiating signal. Through cancer, the organism, now a parent, implements the self-actuated programmed death of Skulachev's phenoptosis. This "first death" enhances by proxy the offspring's chance of "second death" (or "double death") through diminished parental care. Repetition over generations realizes a purifying selection against genes causing energy dissipation. The removal of the deleterious germline gene mutations permanently generated by Muller's ratchet gives a benefit. We generalize, motivated by the parallels between cancer and aging, the purifying selection posited for cancer to aging. An ARD would be initiated in the organ by multicausal disruption of homeostasis, and be followed by dormancy and senescence until its onset near the end of the life cycle. Just as for cancer, the ARD eventually enhances double death, and the realized permanent selection gives a benefit to the species through the selection against germ line genes that disrupt homeostasis. Given their similarities, cancer and aging are combined in the posited Unified Cancer-Aging Adaptation (UCAA) model, which may be confirmed by next-generation sequencing data. Also because of the emerging important role of cellular senescence, the hypothesis may guide the development of therapies against both cancer and aging.

VL  - 21

SP  - 739-744
AB  - The aim of the paper is to highlight the link between climatic conditions and the developmental stages of the species Cydalima perspectalis. If the temperature is low the evolution in days of the development stages increase and vice versa. For the population studied in 2020, the first flight of adults took place on May 18, and the last on October 14. It is clear that it completed 2 generations and the amount of effective temperature for the first generation is 646.7 degrees C and for the second generation it was 628.3 degrees C. The amount of effective temperature (degrees-days)in the period 2019-2020 for the egg stage varies between 62.8 degrees C in 2020 and 48.6 degrees C in 2019, for the larval stage is between 444.8 degrees C (2020) and 403.4 degrees C (2019) and for the pupae stage the values are between 139.1 degrees C (2020) and 74.1 degrees C (2019).Under the natural influence of climatic factors, the number of generations of the species Cydalima perspectalis in the Craiova area varies from one year to another, this suggests that this species is directly dependent on temperature.

TI  - Planning Algorithm for Optimal CHP Generation Plant Connection in Urban Distribution Network (UDN) according LCTA Principle
AB  - Environmental awareness and sustainable development based on long-term diversification of energy sources are key points on the agenda of energy policy-makers. As part of electrical power systems UDNs are evolving from the present traditional electricity supply network towards more decentralized system with smaller, more efficient generation unit normally connected directly to the network at consumer sites. Combined Heat & Power (CHP) generation is the most efficient way of energy supply in urban area available today. It delivers significant benefits to its host facilities and urban distributed network (UDN) to which is connected. Economic viability of CHP generation for many sites requires integration with the UDN for backup and supplementary power needs and in some case the export of excess power to the UDN. CHP system integration into existing UDN entail installation costs. How these integration costs are distributed will have considerable impact on development and implementation of CHP generation in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to use analytical and statistical methods to develop an algorithm that provide means of determining the optimum capacity of a CHP generating plant that can be accommodated within the UDN, which correspond to Least Cost Technically Acceptable (LCTA) principle, and the UDN long term network planning policy. In order to determine optimal size of CHP generating plant that could be connected at any particular busbar on the UDN without causing a significant adverse impact on performance of the UDN and with minimum connection cost an algorithm is created that incorporates an analytical and multiple regression analysis model. It is tested using data obtained from ERAC power analysing software incorporating load flow, fault current level and power losses analysis. Additional data needed for effective algorithm creation was obtained via surveys of local UDN operators and planners. These analyses are performed on a 34 busbar network resembling part of the real UDN of Cork city for validation purposes and accuracy of the algorithm proposed.

AB  - Biological aspects of Chrysoperla raimundoi Freitas & Penny (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae). The green lacewings are important predators and are found in several agroecosystems. The temperature is one of the decisive factors for the development of insects. and there is an acceptable variation gradient for each species. Therefore, the purpose of this Study was not only to check the influence of different temperatures on the embryonic and postembryonic development of Chrysoperla raimundoi, as well as check the consequences in the different generations. The immature stages were reared at four different environmental conditions, three of them with constant temperatures (19,0, 25,0 e 31,0 degrees C) and the fourth rearing place was external to the laboratory without control of the abiotic factors. The duration of the embryonic period, first. second and third larval instar, pupal stage, and front egg to adult were evaluated; also the survival rate of each instar and stage and the emergence rate were calculated. The embryonic and post embryonic development differed between the generations F, and F, Also, the influence of different temperatures for the generation F-2 among individuals created at 31,0 degrees C showed reduction on the development rate regarding the other two environments. It was possible to observe that the generation, has its development influenced by different temperatures, and the 19,0 degrees C temperature prolonged its development.

AB  - Mass rearing of parasitoids depends on choosing appropriate alternative hosts. The objective of this study was to select alternative hosts to rear the parasitoid Palmistichus elaeisis Delvare & LaSalle, 1993 (Hymenoptera: Eulophiclae). Pupae of the lepidopterans Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, 1818 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Bombyx mori Linnaeus, 1 758 (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and Thyrinteina arnobia (Stoll, 1782) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) were exposed to parasitism by females of P. elaeisis. The duration of the life cycle of P. elaeisis was 21.60 +/- 0.16 and 24.15 +/- 0.65 days on pupae of A. gemmatalis and B. mori, respectively, with 100.0% parasitism of the pupae and 71.4 and 100.0% emergence of parasitoids from the first and second hosts, respectively. The offspring number of P. elaeisis was 511.00 +/- 49.70 and 110.20 +/- 19.37 individuals per pupa of B. mori and A. gemmatalis, respectively. The reproduction of P. elaeisis from pupae of T. arnobia after six generations was similar to the other hosts.

VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 405-410
AB  - We compared temperature selection, growth and reproductive output between two populations, and movement and home range size among three populations of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentine serpentine) occupying habitats with different productivities in Ontario, Canada. We examined the hypothesis that primary productivity constrains growth, reproductive effort, and thermal and home range behavior. We predicted that individuals in a habitat with high productivity would grow faster, produce larger clutches of eggs, select warmer temperatures, and maintain smaller home ranges than individuals in a less productive habitat. As expected, turtles in the more productive habitat grew more rapidly and had a higher reproductive output than those in the less productive habitat. Turtles maintained higher body temperatures at the more productive site, but this may have been because ambient temperatures were higher at the productive site rather than because turtles were selecting higher temperatures. Size of home range and distances moved did not differ among study populations, which suggests that productivity was not a good proximate measure of home range behavior. Differences among sites in ambient temperature, type and distribution of prey, and turtle density made it difficult to separate the effect of each factor on growth and reproduction. Future research should measure variation among individuals in energy now, particularly to improve our understanding of variation in home range behavior.

AB  - In this chapter, we present a series of four articles derived from a Introductory Workshop on Biological Rhythms presented at the 72nd Annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology: Clocks and Rhythms. A diverse range of species, from cyanobacteria to humans, evolved endogenous biological clocks that allow for the anticipation of daily variations in light and temperature. The ability to anticipate environmental variation promotes optimal performance and survival. In the first article, Introduction to Chronobiology, we present a brief historical time line of how circadian concepts and terminology have emerged since the early observation of daily leaf movement in plants made by an astronomer in the 1700s. Workshop Part IA provides an overview of the molecular basis for rhythms generation in several key model organisms, Workshop Part IB focuses on how biology built a brain clock capable of coordinating the daily timing of essential brain and physiological processes, and Workshop Part IC gives key insight into how researchers study sleep and rhythms in humans.

TI  - Biomass Production and Removal of Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Processed Municipal Wastewater by Salix schwerinii: A Field Trial
VL  - 13
IS  - 16
AB  - In many Baltic regions, short-rotation willow (Salix spp.) is used as a vegetation filter for wastewater treatment and recycling of valuable nutrients to upsurge bioeconomy development. In this context, a four-year field trial (2016-2019) was carried out near a wastewater treatment plant in eastern Finland (Outokumpu) to investigate the effect of the processed wastewater (WW) on biomass production as well as the nutrients uptake capability (mainly N and P) by a willow variety (Salix schwerinii). Results indicated that WW irrigation expressively increased the willow diameter growth and biomass yield around 256% and 6510%, respectively, compared to the control treatment site (without WW). The willow was also able to accumulate approximately 41-60% of the N and 32-50% of the P in two years (2018-2019). Overall, willow showed a total 20% mortality rate under WW irrigation throughout the growing periods (2017-2019) as compared to control (39%). The results demonstrate that willow has the potential to control eutrophication (reducing nutrients load) from the wastewater with the best survival rate and can provide high biomass production for bioenergy generations in cold climatic conditions.

TI  - Escherichia coli populations adapt to complex, unpredictable fluctuations by minimizing trade-offs across environments
VL  - 29

SP  - 2545-2555
AB  - In nature, organisms are simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses (i.e. complex environments) that often fluctuate unpredictably. Although both these factors have been studied in isolation, the interaction of the two remains poorly explored. To address this issue, we selected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli under complex (i.e. stressful combinations of pH, H2O2 and NaCl) unpredictably fluctuating environments for similar to 900 generations. We compared the growth rates and the corresponding trade-off patterns of these populations to those that were selected under constant values of the component stresses (i.e. pH, H2O2 and NaCl) for the same duration. The fluctuation-selected populations had greater mean growth rate and lower variation for growth rate over all the selection environments experienced. However, whereas the populations selected under constant stresses experienced trade-offs in the environments other than those in which they were selected, the fluctuation-selected populations could bypass the across-environment trade-offs almost entirely. Interestingly, trade-offs were found between growth rates and carrying capacities. The results suggest that complexity and fluctuations can strongly affect the underlying trade-off structure in evolving populations.

VL  - 63
SP  - 716-725
AB  - This paper addresses the viability of converting single-family residential buildings in Brazil into zero energy buildings (ZEBs). The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A fuzzy reinforcement learning approach to thermal unit commitment problem
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 737-750
AB  - Unit commitment problem (UCP) aims at optimizing generation cost for meeting a given load demand under several operational constraints. We propose to use fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) approach for efficient and reliable solution to the unit commitment problem. In particular, we cast UCP as a multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning task wherein individual generators act as players for optimizing the cost to meet a given load over a twenty-four-hour period. Unit commitment task has been fuzzified, and the most optimal unit commitment solution is generated by employing RL on this fuzzy multigenerator setup. Our proposed multiagent RL framework does not assume any a priori task or system knowledge, and the generators gradually learn to produce most optimal output solely based on their collective generation. We look at the UCP as a sequential decision-making task with reward/penalty to reduce the collective generation cost of generators. To the best of our knowledge, ours is a first attempt at solving UCP by employing fuzzy reinforcement learning. We test our approach on a ten-generating-unit system with several equality and inequality constraints. Simulation results and comparisons against several recent UCP solution methods prove superiority and viability of our proposed multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning technique.

TI  - Synergetic Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance by Selective Charge Anderson Localization-Delocalization Transition in n-Type Bi-Doped PbTe/Ag2Te Nanocomposite
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 3806-3815
AB  - Considerable efforts have been devoted to enhancing thermoelectric performance, by employing phonon scattering from nanostructural architecture, and material design using phonon-glass and electron-crystal concepts. The nanostructural approach helps to lower thermal conductivity but has limited effect on the power factor. Here, we demonstrate selective charge Anderson localization as a route to maximize the Seebeck coefficient while simultaneously preserving high electrical conductivity and lowering the lattice thermal conductivity. We confirm the viability of interface potential modification in an n-type Bi-doped PbTe/Ag2Te nanocomposite and the resulting enhancement in thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT. The introduction of random potentials via Ag2Te nanoparticle distribution using extrinsic phase mixing was determined using scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. When the Ag2Te undergoes a structural phase transition (T > 420 K) from monoclinic beta-Ag2Te to cubic alpha-Ag2Te, the band gap in the alpha-Ag2Te increases due to the p-d hybridization. This results in a decrease in the potential barrier height, which gives rise to partial delocalization of the electrons, while wave packets of the holes are still in a localized state. Using this strategic approach, we achieved an exceptionally high thermoelectric figure-of-merit in n-type PbTe materials, a ZT greater than 2.0, suitable for waste heat power generation.

TI  - The development of a thermo-economic evaluation method for solar aided power generation
VL  - 116
SP  - 112-119
AB  - In this paper, a method is derived for evaluating the thermo-economic performance of solar aided power generation (SAPG) hybrid systems. These systems can achieve emissions reduction and energy savings compared to conventional coal-fired power generation systems. In the discussed model of SAPG hybrid system, various stages of heating feed-water in a conventional coal-fired power plant steam Rankine system are replaced by steam injected from solar direct steam generation (DSG). In order to determine the thermo-economic viability of SAPG compared to conventional power generation, convenient methods are required for evaluating the performance of SAPG systems. Therefore, an analysis method is developed which involves defining a generalized steam-water distribution matrix equation. This matrix approach simplifies the traditional thermal calculation and has a one-to-one correspondence with the system structure. As a case study, the proposed method is successfully used to solve the case of a 600 MW power generation system with the integration of DSG. A comparison of the case study system with (SAPG) and without (non-SAPG) the integration of the solar DSG shows thermo-economic benefits to the hybridised system. If the state parameters are taken as variables, this method can be used to study the effects of changes in system, equipment, operation, and load on the thermal economy of the integrated system.

First published April 29, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90562.2008.-Microbes have been widely used in experimental evolutionary studies because they possess a variety of valuable traits that facilitate large-scale experimentation. Many replicated populations can be cultured in the laboratory simultaneously along with appropriate controls. Short generation times and large population sizes make microbes ideal experimental subjects, ensuring that many spontaneous mutations occur every generation and that adaptive variants can spread rapidly through a population. Another highly useful experimental feature is the ability to preserve and store ancestral and evolutionarily derived clones. These can be revived in parallel to allow the direct measurement of the competitive fitness of a descendant compared with its ancestor. The extent of adaptation can thereby be measured quantitatively and compared statistically by direct competition among derived groups and with the ancestor. Thus, fitness and adaptation need not be matters of qualitative speculation, but are quantitatively measurable variables in these systems. Replication allows the quantification of heterogeneity in responses to imposed selection and thereby statistical distinction between changes that are systematic responses to the selective regimen and those that are specific to individual populations.

AB  - Due to the high dependency on hydroelectric power generation, Brazil faced a power shortage in 2001. In order to remedy the situation and avoid more severe power crises in the future, the Brazilian Government launched incentive programmes to encourage thermal and renewable power generation. The Programme of Incentives to Alternative Sources (PROINFA) is mainly devoted to the utilisation of biomass. The success of PROINFA depends on the availability of reliable studies for assessing existing biomass resources and the viability of their utilisation for power generation. In this study, energy potentials of the main biomass resources in the northeastern region of Brazil have been assessed. The economy of the north-eastern region of Brazil is heavily dependent on its sugar industry. Biomass available from sugarcane cultivation and processing represents an annual regional energy resource of 40.5 TWh at an average cost of US$ 0.005/kWh. Bamboo, cultivated as a dedicated energy crop, has the second largest annual energy potential of 30.8 TWh at an average cost of US$ 0.009/kWh. Municipal solid waste, generated in the region, has an annual energy potential of about 16.7 TWh. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 36
IS  - 15
SP  - 8267-8273
AB  - Biomass gasification streams typically contain a mixture of CO, H-2, CH4, and CO(2 )as the majority components and frequently require conditioning for downstream processes. Herein, we investigate the catalytic upgrading of surrogate biomass gasifiers through the generation of syngas. Seeking a bifunctional system capable of converting CO2 and CH4 to CO, a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalyst based on Fe/MgAl(2)O(4 )was decorated with an increasing content of Ni metal and evaluated for producing syngas using different feedstock compositions. This approach proved efficient for gas upgrading, and the incorporation of adequate Ni content increased the CO content by promoting the RWGS and dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions. The larger CO productivity attained at high temperatures was intimately associated with the generation of FeNi3 alloys. Among the catalysts' series, Ni-rich catalysts favored the CO productivity in the presence of CH4, but important carbon deposition processes were noticed. On the contrary, 2Ni-Fe/MgAl2O4 resulted in a competitive and cost-effective system delivering large amounts of CO with almost no coke deposits. Overall, the incorporation of a suitable realistic application for valorization of variable composition of biomass-gasification derived mixtures obtaining a syngas-rich stream thus opens new routes for biosyngas production and upgrading.

VL  - 150
IS  - 2
SP  - 113-122
AB  - Understanding tolerance of thermal extremes by pest insects is essential for developing integrated management strategies, as tolerance traits can provide insights into constraints on activity and survival. A major question in thermal biology is whether thermal limits vary systematically with microclimate variation, or whether other biotic or abiotic factors can influence these limits in a predictable manner. Here, we report the results of experiments determining thermal limits to activity and survival at extreme temperatures in the stalk borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), collected from either Saccharum spp. hybrids (sugarcane) (Poaceae) or Cyperus papyrus L. (Cyperaceae) and then reared under standard conditions in the laboratory for 1-2 generations. Chill-coma temperature (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), lower lethal temperatures (LLT), and freezing temperature between E.saccharina collected from the two host plants were compared. CTmin and CTmax of E.saccharina moths collected from sugarcane were significantly lower than those from C.papyrus (CTmin=2.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C; CTmax=44.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 44.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C). By contrast, LLT of moths and freezing temperatures of pupae did not vary with host plant [LLT for 50% (LT50) of the moth population, when collected from sugarcane: -3.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, from C.papyrus: -3.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C]. Freezing temperatures of pupae collected from C.papyrus were -18.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C and of those from sugarcane -17.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C. The E.saccharina which experienced the lowest minimum temperature (in C.papyrus) did not have the lowest CTmin, although the highest estimate of CTmax was found in E.saccharina collected from C.papyrus and this was also the microsite which reported the highest maximum temperatures. These results therefore suggest that host plant may strongly mediate lower critical thermal limits, but not necessarily LLT or freezing temperatures. These results have significant implications for ongoing pest management and thermal biology of these and other insects.

TI  - Production prediction of cyclic multi-thermal fluid stimulation in a horizontal well
VL  - 146
SP  - 949-958
AB  - Cyclic multi-thermal fluid stimulation (i.e., huff and puff) in a horizontal well is an effective way to recover offshore heavy oil reservoirs. To rapidly predict reservoir production performance, an analytical model for predicting the productivity of a cyclic multi-thermal fluid stimulation in a horizontal well was developed in this study. The underlying assumption in this study is that multi-thermal fluids spread around the horizontal well cylindrically at the beginning of injection and then along the top or bottom as the fluids contact those regions; this creates a composite reservoir with hot and cold zones. First, a production formula for a horizontal well in the composite reservoir described was derived using the equivalent flow resistance method from the water electric analogy principle. A heat diffusion model of multi-thermal fluids was then used to describe how the fluids spread out in the reservoir. Then, an evolution model of the physical fields was built by considering the enhanced oil recovery mechanism of multi-thermal fluids, which describes the evolution of temperature, pressure, oil viscosity, relative permeability curves, etc. during the huff-and-puff process. A new formula was used to determine the reduction in viscosity caused by carbon dioxide present in the fluid. The desired production prediction model was then established by coupling the developed production formula, heat diffusion model and evolution model. The analytical model was verified by numerical simulations and application to an offshore oil field. This study described an effective and quick method for productivity prediction, reservoir dynamic analysis and injection optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Levy Flight and Fitness Distance Balance-Based Coyote Optimization Algorithm for Effective Automatic Generation Control of PV-Based Multi-Area Power Systems
AB  - In this paper, Levy flight and Fitness Distance Balance (FDB)-based coyote optimization algorithm (LRFDBCOA) is proposed to improve the performance of automatic generation control (AGC) of three different PV-based interconnected power systems. First, the achievement of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the two-area PV-reheat thermal power system with PI controller, which is widely used in the literature, and the results are compared with the results obtained using genetic algorithm (GA), firefly algorithm (FA), and modified whale optimization algorithm (M-WOA) introduced in previous studies. Then, the control performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the newly constructed two-area PV-non-reheat thermal power system with governor dead band (GDB) and two-area PV-multi-source power system with electrolyser and fuel cell. As the costs of solar energy systems decrease, the microgrids containing these resources increase. Therefore, such a study will make an important contribution to the literature. For the AGC of these two systems, proportional-integral-derivative (PID), tilt-integral-derivative (TID) and fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers are used. Thus, both the performance of the proposed algorithm on AGC and the compatibility of the two newly tested systems with PID, TID and FOPID controllers are revealed. As a result, the proposed LRFDBCOA algorithm outperforms algorithms such as GA, FA, M-WOA and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) in interconnected two-area power systems controlled by PID, TID and FOPID, and it shows superior control performance in terms of settling time, maximum/minimum peak value of Delta f(1), Delta f(2) and Delta P-tie under varying load conditions and perturbed system parameters.

TI  - Agroclimatic zoning of acai crop (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) for the state of Espirito Santo
VL  - 46

SP  - 707-717
AB  - The products of acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) have great economic and cultural importance in Brazil with a growing consumer market. Seeking to provide a basis for the expansion of this crop in other states, we sought to develop the agroclimatic zoning for this crop in the state of Espirito Santo. Therefore, we used data from 110 meteorological stations and governmental geotecnologic's tool ArcGIS 10.1 for spatialize temperature data, precipitation and water deficit and then reschedule them for the generation of zoning. The results showed that 20.74% of the total area of the Espirito Santo has areas suitable to this culture, located in the Northeastern, Southern and mountainous, with Linhares the municipality with the highest fitness. Although most of the state has some kind of constraint that limits the cultivation, whether the variable is water deficit precipitation, some techniques can minimize such restrictions. Thus, it becomes feasible to implement the culture of acai in the state of Espirito Santo according to the variables temperature, precipitation and water deficit.

TI  - Multi-Axis Niche Examination of Ecological Specialization: Responses to Heat, Desiccation and Starvation Stress in Two Species of Pit-Building Antlions
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
AB  - Classical ecological studies discussing specialization usually focus on species' performance along one niche axis. This approach may overlook niche differentiation evident in another dimension which could explain species co-occurrence. The present research exemplifies a comprehensive approach to examining local adaptation. Specifically, we examined multiple niche axes by subjecting a model organism to various experimental conditions to monitor responses to extreme stress associated with heat, desiccation and starvation. Our model system comprised two pit-building antlions: the habitat generalist Myrmeleon hyalinus and the habitat specialist Cueta lineosa. Previous research has shown that the foraging performance of the generalist is better than that of the specialist, even in the latter's characteristic habitat. We illustrate that this apparent superiority of the habitat generalist does not manifest itself along other niche axes; rather, the habitat specialist holds a set of traits that provide an advantage under harsh environmental conditions. Specifically, C. lineosa has an advantage over M. hyalinus at high temperatures, exhibiting a higher survival rate and improved foraging success (i.e., high-temperature specialist). C. lineosa is also more efficient in its energy budget, losing less mass during starvation and gaining mass more efficiently during feeding. This superior efficiency is a result of physiological adaptations as well as behavioural responses to harsh conditions. In conclusion, our results imply that the habitat specialization of C. lineosa has not led it towards an evolutionary dead-end.

TI  - Analysis of two heat storage integrations for an Organic Rankine Cycle Parabolic trough solar power plant
VL  - 125
SP  - 353-367
AB  - Among the concentrated solar power technologies, those based on Organic Rankine Cycles have a very low market presence. However they have favorable characteristics for applications with low temperature and small/medium size (<10 MW), such as off-grid applications or distributed power generation. In this paper is analyzed a 5 MW parabolic trough plant integrated with an Organic Rankine cycle power block and thermal storage. On this purpose, two different thermal storage integrations are analyzed. They are based on two different heat storage layouts: direct system using Hitec XL both as Heat Transfer Fluid and as storage medium; indirect system using Therminol VP-1 as Heat Transfer Fluid and Hitec XL as storage medium. Full system performance at rated and off-design conditions is presented operating with different organic working fluids. Its potential application and main challenges for its development are discussed in terms of performance and costs. Among the analyzed working fluids, the best results were obtained for the cycle working with Toluene with an efficiency at the power block of 31.5% and an estimated power block cost of 825 (sic)/kW. The indirect storage layout was the most interesting from the point of view of Levelized Electricity Cost (16.19 c(sic)/kW) and productivity (28.2 GW 11/y for a 5 MWel plant) for 10 h of storage However, it results in a storage tanks volume 26% greater than the obtained for the equivalent direct storage layout. The results show the competitiveness and the potential of the proposed integrated small size parabolic trough designs for isolated applications as mines or for some distributed generation uses where grid capacity is limited.

TI  - Effects of various inhibitory substances and immobilization on ethanol production efficiency of a thermotolerant Pichia kudriavzevii
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Background Although bioethanol production has been gaining worldwide attention as an alternative to fossil fuel, ethanol productivities and yields are still limited due to the susceptibility of fermentation microorganisms to various stress and inhibitory substances. There is therefore an unmet need to search for multi-stress-tolerant organisms to improve ethanol productivity and reduce production cost, particularly when lignocellulosic hydrolysates are used as the feedstock. Results Here, we have characterized a previously isolated Pichia kudriavzevii LC375240 strain which is thermotolerant to high temperatures of 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. More excitingly, growth and ethanol productivity of this strain exhibit strong tolerance to multiple stresses such as acetic acid, furfural, formic acid, H2O2 and high concentration of ethanol at 42 degrees C. In addition, simple immobilization of LC375240 on corncobs resulted to a more stable and higher efficient ethanol production for successive four cycles of repeated batch fermentation at 42 degrees C. Conclusion The feature of being thermotolerant and multi-stress-tolerant is unique to P. kudriavzevii LC375240 and makes it a good candidate for second-generation bioethanol fermentation as well as for investigating the molecular basis underlying the robust stress tolerance. Immobilization of P. kudriavzevii LC375240 on corncobs is another option for cheap and high ethanol productivity.

TI  - Obtaining and characterization of silicon(Si) from wheat husk ash for its possible application in solar cells
VL  - 271
AB  - Crystalline silicon was obtained from the ash of wheat (husk and spike), which was fertilized by a system of controlled release of urea. The method used was a thermal reduction (550 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C). Temperature (TGA), morphological (SEM-EDX), FTIR, XRD, and RAMAN characterizations were performed. Silicon was used to build a solar cell with this configuration ITO/CdS/Si/CP/Au, which was characterized by J-V curves. In the present work, we obtained highly crystalline silicon, which could be used for energy generation at low temperatures of magnesium-reduction. The increase of silica in wheat could be attributed to the type of fertilization. We are using an environmentally friendly system due to the reduction reaction to silicon from the ashes of what is feasible to contribute to clean energy generation at a low cost.

TI  - Trait-specific consequences of inbreeding on adaptive phenotypic plasticity
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-6
AB  - Environmental changes may stress organisms and stimulate an adaptive phenotypic response. Effects of inbreeding often interact with the environment and can decrease fitness of inbred individuals exposed to stress more so than that of outbred individuals. Such an interaction may stem from a reduced ability of inbred individuals to respond plastically to environmental stress; however, this hypothesis has rarely been tested. In this study, we mimicked the genetic constitution of natural inbred populations by rearing replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations for 25 generations at a reduced population size (10 individuals). The replicate inbred populations, as well as control populations reared at a population size of 500, were exposed to a benign developmental temperature and two developmental temperatures at the lower and upper margins of their viable range. Flies developed at the three temperatures were assessed for traits known to vary across temperatures, namely abdominal pigmentation, wing size, and wing shape. We found no significant difference in phenotypic plasticity in pigmentation or in wing size between inbred and control populations, but a significantly higher plasticity in wing shape across temperatures in inbred compared to control populations. Given that the norms of reaction for the noninbred control populations are adaptive, we conclude that a reduced ability to induce an adaptive phenotypic response to temperature changes is not a general consequence of inbreeding and thus not a general explanation of inbreeding-environment interaction effects on fitness components.

TI  - Is there a trade-off between peak performance and performance breadth across temperatures for aerobic scope in teleost fishes?
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - The physiology and behaviour of ectotherms are strongly influenced by environmental temperature. A general hypothesis is that for performance traits, such as those related to growth, metabolism or locomotion, species face a trade-off between being a thermal specialist or a thermal generalist, implying a negative correlation between peak performance and performance breadth across a range of temperatures. Focusing on teleost fishes, we performed a phylogenetically informed comparative analysis of the relationship between performance peak and breadth for aerobic scope (AS), which represents whole-animal capacity available to carry out simultaneous oxygen-demanding processes (e.g. growth, locomotion, reproduction) above maintenance. Literature data for 28 species indicate that peak aerobic capacity is not linked to thermal performance breadth and that other physiological factors affecting thermal tolerance may prevent such a trade-off from emerging. The results therefore suggest that functional links between peak and thermal breadth for AS may not constrain evolutionary responses to environmental changes such as climate warming.

SP  - 182-186
AB  - Automation and Internet-of-Things (IoT) open doors to achieve increased productivity and efficiency. Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is a type of Auto-identification technique that identifies, locates, authenticates, and engages with other IoT devices to efficiently perform one or more tasks. The concept of the digital twin is enhanced by UHF RFID for the fourth-generation industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. UHF RFID antennas are one of the key endpoint components that are deployed throughout factories, facilitating automation. Antennas predominantly used in industrial environment requires enormous durability to handle vibration, shock, impact, and thermal shocks without trading-off the radiofrequency (RF) performance. This article proposes a novel durable dual-virtual patch antenna design and manufacturing technique for industrial UHF RFID application. The durability of the antenna is offered by the non-conventional RF substrate, galvanized steel backplate and the polyurethane resin-filled plastic radome. The antenna is designed to be assembled by full and semi-robotic process automation.

TI  - Advanced Three-Level Converter with Newly Developed 1200V Reverse Blocking IGBTs
AB  - We developed the high voltage type modules for these renewal energy systems such as the Wind Turbine systems, Mega solar systems and "AC690V system". The high voltage type modules are consisted of the 6th generation 1700V IGBT and FWD and 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT. There was a problem in the 1200V RB-IGBT for its productivity with conventional structure, because it is necessary to have long doping process time. In this time a new hybrid through-silicon isolation process was developed for 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT (RB-IGBT by combining wafer front-side Boron diffusion and back-side V-groove etching). Collector layer was implanted into the back-side and the surface of the V-groove, and electrically connected to the front-side Boron diffusion after activation. Thermal budget for the surface depth of Boron diffusion was thereby significantly shortened more than half for 1200V devices. This paper explains the 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT process flow and the experimental results of electrical characteristics. We had achieved that the power conversion efficiency of A-NPC 3-level inverter using RB-IGBTs was 98.57%, which total loss is 15% and 31% smaller than that of NPC 3-level and normal 2-level inverters, respectively.

TI  - A MODELING ANALYSIS OF THE SUCCESSFUL BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF SITONA-DISCOIDEUS (COLEOPTERA, CURCULIONIDAE) BY MICROCTONUS-AETHIOPOIDES (HYMENOPTERA, BRACONIDAE) IN NEW-ZEALAND
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
SP  - 165-178
AB  - 1. Simple models were developed to explore the interaction between the lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and its introduced braconid parasite Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in New Zealand. 2. A model for the population dynamics of S. discoideus demonstrated that observed levels of parasitism account for a decline in pest abundance, in spite of strong density-dependent mortality in the host. 3. An empirical model for changes in parasitism from year to year, spanning five to six parasitoid generations each year, suggested that control is likely to be maintained in the long term and that the interaction is stable. 4. Tentative values were established for the average searching efficiency of M. aethiopoides (approximately 0.25 m2 per parasitoid per generation) and for parameters governing pseudo-interference and a functional response to host density, based on analysis of discrete parasitoid generations. 5. Based on experimental data and field temperatures, a simulation model of daily parasitoid behaviour over summer, when generations overlap, supported the hypothesis that atypically developing parasitoids are those oviposited in newly emerged adult weevils. The model accounted for the observed atypical summer build-up of parasitism which is essential for the success of biological control. 6. The models suggested that biological control of S. discoideus is complementary to other forms of control, including other biological control agents, because subsequent levels of parasitism appear little affected by changes in pest density. 7. It is argued that quantitative analysis of specific biological control case studies, both successful and unsuccessful, is a vital prerequisite for improvements in general biocontrol theory and practice.

VL  - 137
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-29
AB  - The effects of salinity on survival, fecundity and sex ratio were studied in Dinophilus gyrociliatus; a small polychaete with a short lifespan, semicontinuous reproduction and progamic sex determination. The experiment was performed on two groups, originally collected as one sample, from the port of Genoa in November 1995. The specimens were separated into two groups, differing only in their diet: the first was fed with frozen spinach and the other with Tetramin Mikromin. The experiment was performed in 1998 after numerous generations had been maintained under laboratory conditions. The maximum expectation of life at birth varied with salinity level, and both groups showed a better tolerance towards a salinity below 35 psu than above 35 psu. The influence of both salinity and diet on fecundity had statistical significance even though the greatest differences were due to diet; animals fed with Tetramin had a two- or even threefold higher fecundity than those fed with spinach. Diet and salinity also had a statistically significant influence on the sex ratio. These results, as well as all the experimental observations carried out up to date, indicate that in D. gyrociliatus the determination of the sex ratio has a strong phenotypic component.

TI  - The role of environmental generalist species in ecosystem function
VL  - 188
IS  - 2
SP  - 279-295
AB  - We constructed a Lotka-Volterra-like competition model to study the role of environmental generalists in maintaining ecosystem function under a range of species richnesses and environmental conditions. Ecosystem function was quantified as community biomass, proportion of initial species that coexist through time, and resilience and resistance to perturbation. Generalist and specialist species were created that differed in their realized growth rates under suboptimal environmental conditions. Generalists were more tolerant of suboptimal conditions but specialists grew faster when conditions were optimal. Model simulations were performed involving generalist-only and specialist-only communities comprised of 4-100 species under constant and cyclical environmental conditions. We used pulses applied to biomass to estimate resilience and pulses applied to the environment to estimate resistance. We also simulated 4-species and 100-species mixed communities of generalists and specialists under the same cyclical environmental conditions. Analysis of model predictions was performed after all simulations reached quasi-equilibrium. Comparisons of total community biomass, proportion of initial species coexisting through time, resilience, and resistance under constant and cyclical environmental conditions showed that, in some situations, a species-poor community of generalists can have equal or greater ecosystem function than a species-rich community of specialists. Results from the mixed community simulations confirmed these results. Our analyses suggest that the environmental tolerances of species can be an important consideration in determining ecosystem function, and should be considered in asking whether all species, or certain key species, drive the positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem function.

TI  - Thermal pollution impacts on rivers and power supply in the Mississippi River watershed
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - Thermal pollution from power plants degrades riverine ecosystems with ramifications beyond the natural environment as it affects power supply. The transport of thermal effluents along river reaches may lead to plant-to-plant interferences by elevating condenser inlet temperatures at downstream locations, which lower thermal efficiencies and trigger regulatory-forced power curtailments. We evaluate thermal pollution impacts on rivers and power supply across 128 plants with once-through cooling technologies in the Mississippi River watershed. By leveraging river network topologies with higher resolutions (0.05.) than previous studies, we reveal the need to address the issue in a more spatially resolved manner, capable of uncovering diverse impacts across individual plants, river reaches and sub-basins. Results show that the use of coarse river network resolutions may lead to substantial overestimations in magnitude and length of impaired river reaches. Overall, there is a modest limitation on power production due to thermal pollution, given existing infrastructure, regulatory and climate conditions. However, tradeoffs between thermal pollution and electricity generation show important implications for the role of alternative cooling technologies and environmental regulation under current and future climates. Recirculating cooling technologies may nearly eliminate thermal pollution and improve power system reliability under stressed climate-water conditions. Regulatory limits also reduce thermal pollution, but at the expense of significant reductions in electricity generation capacity. However, results show several instances when power production capacity rises at individual plants when regulatory limits reduce upstream thermal pollution. These dynamics across energy-water systems highlight the need for high-resolution simulations and the value of coherent planning and optimization across infrastructure with mutual dependencies on natural resources to overcome climate-water constraints on productivity and bring to fruition energy and environmental win-win opportunities.

TI  - UK scenario of islanded operation of active distribution networks with renewable distributed generators
VL  - 34
IS  - 12
SP  - 2585-2591
AB  - This paper reports on the current UK scenario of islanded operation of active distribution networks with renewable distributed generators (RDGs). Different surveys indicate that the present scenario does not economically justify islanding operation of active distribution networks with RDGs. Anti-islanding protection schemes currently enforce the renewable distributed generators (RDGs) to disconnect immediately and stop generation for grid faults through loss of grid (LOG) protection system. This greatly reduces the benefits of RDG deployment. With rising RDG penetration, much benefit would be lost if the RDGs are not allowed to island only due to conventional operational requirement of utilities. For preventing disconnection of RDGs during LOG, several islanding operation, control and protection schemes are being developed. Technical studies clearly indicate the need to review parts of the ESQCR (Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations) for successful islanded operations. Commercial viability of islanding operation must be assessed in relation to enhancement of power quality, system reliability and supply of potential ancillary services through network support. Demonstration projects under Registered Power Zone and Technical Architecture Projects should be initiated to investigate the usefulness of DG islanding. However these efforts should be compounded with a realistic judgement of the associated technical and economic issues for the development of future power networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Stress response: how cells wrestle with SUMO disruption Cellular stress caused by disrupting attachment of the ubiquitous small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which are present in most organisms and regulate numerous DNA processes and stress responses by attaching to key proteins, results in some remarkable adaptations. Mark Hochstrasser at Yale University, New Haven, USA, and co-workers review how this "sumoylation" is reversed by protease enzymes, and how imbalances between sumoylation and desumoylation may be linked to diseases including cancer. When certain SUMO proteases are deliberately disrupted, the cells quickly become aneuploid, i.e., carry an abnormal number of chromosomes. These cells show severe growth defects, but over many generations they regain the normal number of chromosomes. They also undergo genetic changes that promote alternative mechanisms that compensate for losing the SUMO protease and facilitate the same efficient stress responses as the original cells. The ubiquitin family member SUMO is a covalent regulator of proteins that functions in response to various stresses, and defects in SUMO-protein conjugation or deconjugation have been implicated in multiple diseases. The loss of the Ulp2 SUMO protease, which reverses SUMO-protein modifications, in the model eukaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiaeis severely detrimental to cell fitness and has emerged as a useful model for studying how cells adapt to SUMO system dysfunction. Both short-term and long-term adaptive mechanisms are triggered depending on the length of time cells spend without this SUMO chain-cleaving enzyme. Such short-term adaptations include a highly specific multichromosome aneuploidy and large changes in ribosomal gene transcription. While aneuploidulp2 Delta cells survive, they suffer severe defects in growth and stress resistance. Over many generations, euploidy is restored, transcriptional programs are adjusted, and specific genetic changes that compensate for the loss of the SUMO protease are observed. These long-term adapted cells grow at normal rates with no detectable defects in stress resistance. In this review, we examine the connections between SUMO and cellular adaptive mechanisms more broadly.

TI  - A retrofit integration of an absorption chiller with a microturbine array
SP  - 135-141
AB  - The overall system efficiency of a microturbine generator system, and hence the economic viability, are greatly enhanced through co-generation. The utilization of the exhaust energy for heating needs is well understood and has been extensively implemented. Potentially more desirable but having found far less implementation is the integration of microturbines with absorption chillers to generate cold water. Long recognized as a tremendous opportunity in HVAC systems, the integration of a microturbine with an absorption chiller is complicated by the relatively low quality and quantity of heat available from the traditionally recuperated microturbine system. This paper address the design process and the issues encountered in developing a 160 ton absorption chiller system integrated with an array of eight, 60-kW Capstone microturbines. The designed system is not a pre-packaged turbine/chiller system but rather a system that integrates a mix of existing and new microturbines with a commercial gas-to-liquid heat exchanger and a commercial single effect Li-Br absorption chiller. The goal of the effort is demonstrate a cost effective retrofit installation of an absorption chiller with existing microturbines to effectively provide base load chilling for the building's HVAC needs.

VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 459-468
AB  - Salinity tolerance limits during the ontogenetic development of Farfantepenaeus paulensis postlarvae (PL) were determined at different temperatures. Initially, PL 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 80 maintained in 30 pot (parts per thousand) salinity, 22-25 C, were directly transferred to 15 combinations of salinity (2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt) and temperature (15, 20 and 30 C) for 96 h. Irrespective of age or salinity, higher survival rates were registered at 25 C, PL 10 suffered high mortality, especially at low salinities combined with low (15 C) or high (30 C) temperatures. From PL 20 to PL 40, an increase in survival was observed in all combinations. For PL 60 and 80, tolerance to low salinity was reduced, suggesting that PL have a maximum age by which they are able to develop adaptability to low salinities. In general, the effect of temperature contributed more significantly to mortality in PL 10 and PL 30, but its influence decreased afterwards. From PL, 40, salinity becomes the main factor determining mortality. In order to examine the effects of acclimation to salinity on the tolerance limits, a second set of experiments was performed with PL 5, 10, 15 and 25 acclimated to 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt, 25 C, over a 5-d period. Postlarvae were then transferred to different salinity levels (2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt) and kept for 96 h. High mortality of PL 10 occurred after direct transfer from high to intermediate/low salinity levels. Although the acclimation to salinity increased survival, it was still Door. An increase in the salinity tolerance was observed from PL 15 to 30, even with no acclimation. Results indicate that PL 10 do not have a fully developed osmoregulatory capacity to cope with low and/or abrupt changes of salinity. It is recommended that non-acclimated PL 10 should only be released in environments with salinity at or above 20 pot. If acclimation is carried out, PL may be released in salinities above 10 ppt. The release of PL 10 in salinities below 5 ppt may result in mortality rates of up to 70%. The best age for the release of non-acclimated F. paulensis PL in environments with low and, or wide fluctuations of salinity would be PL 15-30.

TI  - Selection response for Streptococcus agalactiae resistance in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus
VL  - 42
IS  - 11
SP  - 1553-1562
AB  - The potential of selection to improve resistance to streptococcosis was evaluated in a commercial population of Nile tilapia in Thailand. The base generation (G0) consisted of offspring from 98 sires and 149 dams using a partly nested design. At 60 days post-hatch, 30 fish from each family were injected intraperitoneally with a Streptococcosis agalactiae solution (1 x 10(9) CFU/ml) and evaluated for 14 days. Disease resistance was recorded as the number of days from challenge until death (DD) and as a binary (BIN) trait (dead/alive) on day 14. Three models were used for genetic analyses: Cox frailty model for DD; animal model for DD; and animal model for BIN. Age at challenge was fitted as a covariate and contemporary group as fixed or random effect, depending on the model. Fish from the 18 most resistant families were selected to produce the first generation (G1). Heritability estimates for G0 were 0.22, 0.14 +/- 0.02 and 0.11 +/- 0.02 for the Cox, linear DD and linear BIN models, respectively. Selection response indicated that the risk of death decreased to 54%, survival time increased to 3.4 days and survival rate increased to 21%. These results suggest that genetic improvement is possible for this population.

TI  - An Effective Methodology for Short-Term Generation Scheduling of Hydrothermal Power System Using Improved TLBO Algorithm
SP  - 229-238
AB  - The Short-Term Hydrothermal Scheduling (STHTS) is one of the most prominent exercise in the field of power system. It advocates the scheduling of hydro and thermal generations so as to minimize the fuel cost over the planning period by satisfying standard system constraints. The problem of scheduling of a generation mixture of thermal and hydro problems are modelled as a non linear, non convex problems comprising valve point loading effects and a set of equality and inequality constraints. The interpretation of hydrothermal systems with hydro predominance is significantly more complex than hydro system. This problem is extremely difficult to deal using classical techniques. This paper presents a simple and novel concept of improved Teaching Learning based Optimization (ITLBO) algorithm for the solution of short term hydro thermal scheduling problem. The TLBO algorithm is an exceptional distinct optimization algorithm stimulated by the effect of influence of a teacher on the productivity of learners in the domain. The proposed methodology has been applied on a standard test system consisting of four hydro an equivalent thermal unit for 24 hours. The results are evolved in terms of water discharge, reservoir storage volume and fuel cost of thermal units with/without valve point loading effects. The performance of the proposed method is validated by comparing with other methods available in the literature. From the findings, it is obvious that ITLBO based approach is able to provide a better solution.

TI  - GENERATION OF PC-1 WAVES BY THE ION TEMPERATURE ANISOTROPY ASSOCIATED WITH FAST SHOCKS CAUSED BY SUDDEN IMPULSES
VL  - 96
SP  - 17897-17901
AB  - Observations have reported on the high correlation of Pc 1 events with magnetospheric compressions. A number of mechanisms have been suggested for the generation of the Pc 1 waves. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism which leads to the generation of Pc 1 waves. The interaction of a dynamic pressure pulse (DELTA-rho-v2) with the Earth's bow shock leads to the formation of a weak fast mode shock propagating into the magnetosheath. The shock wave can pass right through a tangential discontinuity (magnetopause) and into the magnetosphere, without disturbing either of the structures. In a quasi-perpendicular geometry, the shock wave exhibits anisotropic heating with T perpendicular-to > T parallel-to. This anisotropy drives unstable ion cyclotron waves which we believe can contribute to the generation of the Pc 1 waves which are detected. The viability of the mechanism is demonstrated with simulations. This mechanism could explain peak in the occurrence of observed Pc 1 waves in the postnoon sector where a field-aligned discontinuity in the solar wind would most often be parallel to the magnetopause surface due to the average Parker spiral magnetic field configuration.

TI  - Life Cycle Assessment and Soil Nitrogen Balance of Different N Fertilizers for Top Dressing Rye as Energy Crop for Electricity Generation
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
AB  - Nitrogen fertilizers have been identified in energy crops LCAs as the main contributors to global warming, as well as to many other environmental impacts. The distinct production process and application emissions of nitrogen fertilizer types for top dressing produce different GHG savings when energy crops value chains are compared to fossil energy alternatives. In this study, three types of fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, urea and ammonium sulphate) at N top dressing rates of 80 kg N/ha are used to grow rye for electricity generation under the conditions of the Continental Mediterranean climate of central-northern Spain. Complete LCAs for the whole value chain based on real data were performed in conjunction with soil nitrogen balances (SNBs) to assess the accomplishment of European Union (EU) GHG savings sustainability criteria, as well as the sustainability of fertilization practices for soil nitrogen stocks. The results obtained can provide interesting insights for policy making, since calcium ammonium nitrate, the most common fertilizer for rye crops, led to 66% GHG savings, as opposed to the 69% achieved when applying urea and 77% when ammonium sulphate was used. Nevertheless, the three fertilizers produced annual soil deficits greater than 50 kg N/ha. In order to ensure savings above 80%, as required by the EU sustainability criteria, and sustainable SNBs, additional optimization measures should be taken at key points of the value chain.

VL  - 10

SP  - 348-365
AB  - For organisms with overlapping generations that occur in metapopulations, uncertainty remains regarding the spatiotemporal scale of inference of estimates of the effective number of breeders ((N) over cap (b)) and whether these estimates can be used to predict generational N-e. We conducted a series of tests of the spatiotemporal scale of inference of estimates of N-b in nine consecutive cohorts within a long-term study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). We also tested a recently developed approach to estimate generational Ne from (N) over cap (b) and compared this to an alternative approach for estimating (N) over cap (e) that also accounts for age structure. Multiple lines of evidence were consistent with (N) over cap (b) corresponding to the local (subpopulation) spatial scale and the cohort-specific temporal scale. We found that at least four consecutive cohort-specific estimates of (N) over cap (b) were necessary to obtain reliable estimates of harmonic mean (N) over cap (b) for a subpopulation. Generational (N) over cap (e) derived from cohort-specific (N) over cap (b) was within 7%-50% of an alternative approach to obtain (N) over cap (e), suggesting some population specificity for concordance between approaches. Our results regarding the spatiotemporal scale of inference for Nb should apply broadly to many taxa that exhibit overlapping generations and metapopulation structure and point to promising avenues for using cohort-specific (N) over cap (b) for local-scale genetic monitoring.

TI  - In Situ Hatching Success of Calanoid Copepod Eggs in Hypoxic Sediments of a Coastal Bay
VL  - 32

SP  - 333-338
AB  - Hypoxia can have adverse effects on recruitment of marine copepods via its effects on egg hatching and survival of nauplii. This study investigated the effects of hypoxia on in situ hatching success of calanoid copepods in Gamak Bay, Korea, a shallow (9-m) microtidal coastal bay with long water residence times exceeding a month. Plankton emergence trap/chambers were placed into seafloor-surface sediments in July at a hypoxic site (mean = 0.6 mL L-1) in the inner part of the bay and at a normoxic site in the mid bay. Nauplii that hatched and left the sediment were collected daily for 12 days, and the top 1 cm of sediment was preserved at the end of incubation. The number of eggs in the sediment was >3 X 10(5) eggs m(-2) at the hypoxic site, about six times that at the normoxic site. Most of the eggs appeared to be subitaneous. Egg-hatching rate in the hypoxic site, however, was only 4% of that at the normoxic site, where 57% of the eggs present hatched. Cumulative numbers of eggs hatching into the hypoxic chambers were about half the numbers hatching into the normoxic chambers. The pH level in the sediment was 7.1 to 7.3 at the hypoxic site, slightly lower than in the normoxic sediment (pH > 7.5). That difference seemed to have little effect on egg hatching. High sulfide concentration at the hypoxic site (> 300 mu M), combined with low dissolved oxygen in summer were likely responsible for the depressed egg hatching. However, the cumulative number of eggs that hatched in the hypoxic chambers was still about half of that in the normoxic chambers. Thus, it appears that the hypoxic site might still be a significant source of juveniles for the next generation of the copepods.

AB  - The climatic factors are changing very rapidly in Malaysia. For the farmers to adapt with the changes, government and other external agencies are providing several supports. But still there is a gap between farmers' adaptability with climate change and current level of supports. This study uses descriptive statistics, ordinal regression, and percentile analysis to measure the level of farmers' adaptability to climate change as a result of the various existing supports and encouragements provided by the government and other external agencies, and new supports expected by farmers. The data were collected through questionnaire survey on 198 paddy producing farmers in the area of Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA), North-West Selangor, Malaysia. The study found that among current types of supports provided by different agencies, only farmers' accessibility in the market is statistically significant for influencing their current adaptability to climatic changes. Though 58.6% of the farmers agree that government supports are enough to cope properly with climate change, 12.1% of farmers are not able to cope with climate change with the current level of supports. Farmers' expectations of several new supports has no statistically significant influences on their current adaptability with climatic changes, but their priority ranking for these expected supports will help policymakers to determine the future supports for climatic change adaptation for agriculture sustainability and livelihood sustainability under adverse climatic changes scenarios, especially for Malaysia.

TI  - A Grid Connected Single Phase Transformerless Buck-Boost Based Inverter Which Can Control Two Solar PV Arrays Simultaneously
SP  - 0542-0547
AB  - A new buck-boost based single phase transformerless grid connected photo voltaic (PV) inverter which is having the capability to operate two serially connected subarrays at their respective maximum power point is proposed in this paper. The series connection of the two subarrays and the buck-boost nature of the inverter reduces the number of serially connected modules in a subarray. Further, independent operation of the two subarrays enhances the overall power extraction from the subarrays while they are experiencing significant mismatch at their operating conditions, e.g. insolation level and/or operating temperature. The topological structure of the inverter and its control technique ensures negligible amount of high frequency components in its common mode voltage. As a consequence the overall leakage current associated with the subarrays are restricted well within the permissible limit specified in the standard, VDE 0126-1-1. The operating principle of the proposed scheme along with its rigorous analysis has been presented. The reference current generation for the buck-boost inductor and the controller configuration of the proposed inverter have been elaborated in detail. Detailed simulation study with a 1.3 kW PV system has been carried out to show the viability of the proposed scheme.

TI  - ONBOARD HYDROGEN GENERATION FOR IC ENGINE EMISSIONS REDUCTION
AB  - Improvement of internal combustion engine emissions and performance by the introduction of a reducing gas such as hydrogen has been the subject of research in recent years. The approach reduces engine exhaust emissions and improves fuel consumption. The gas may be introduced into the engine intake or upstream of the exhaust catalyst for different effects. To date, the technique has not been implemented due to the need for onboard storage or generation of hydrogen that complies with suitability for automotive applications. In industrial processes and stationary applications, reforming reactors are well known, highly efficient, and durable means to convert liquid fuels such as diesel into hydrogen or other reducing gas mixtures (synthesis gas). Efficiency and durability for thousands of hours is required for these applications for economic viability. For an automotive application, however, in addition to the above features, fast transient response (e.g. during start up and turndown), compactness, and low cost are also required while maintaining sufficient durability for the application. Also, the need for liquid water common to reactions such as steam reforming or auto-thermal reforming are impractical for automotive applications. A waterless catalytic partial oxidation approach avoids this shortcoming but is not without its own set of problems. Material durability, fuel/air mixing, coke avoidance and reliable ignition means are among the challenges for a practical automotive hydrogen production solution. The catalyst for reacting the fuel must be tolerant to sulfur content common to fuels in use today, and must have resistance to fouling by carbon formation. To overcome these challenges, Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) has developed a diesel-fueled waterless catalytic partial oxidation reformer with efficiency and size suitable for onboard synthesis gas production at low cost. The goal of the development effort was to produce a novel mechanical design with the high efficiency of stationary reformers in a small package which could be operated with low parasitic loss from balance of plant components to maintain high engine efficiency. The reactor design (size, form factor) is discussed, along with performance data showing transient and steady state response of the prototype reactor. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPDX) of heavy fuels such as diesel poses unique challenges, relating to coking and fuel conversion efficiency, which have been addressed and presented in this paper.

VL  - 42

SP  - 6420-6423
AB  - The thermo-optic constants of the flux grown RbTiOAs4 (RTA) have been measured from 0.4577 to 0.7931 mum. These results were fitted to the temperature phase-matching bandwidths (FWHM) for harmonic generation of the Nd:YAG laser and the Nd:YAG laser-pumped KTiOAsO4 (KTA) optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and were used to construct the thermo-optic dispersion formula that can be used for good reproduction of the temperature-dependent phase-matching conditions in the 0.459-3.129 mum range. Applications to the quasi phase-matching are presented.

VL  - 50
SP  - 179-189
AB  - Diapause that extends across multiple years is considered a bet-hedging strategy in insect species that are exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions. The dynamics of extended diapause in herbivores can be complicated when their parasitoids can also extend diapause, although our knowledge of these dynamics is based primarily on pest species. Here, we report on regional variation in the phenology and life history of Trogus parasitoids of Papilio machaon group swallowtail butterflies in western Canada. We observed flexible phenological patterns in this interaction, with both hosts and parasitoids undergoing extended diapause. Additionally, we documented parasitism of earlier instar larvae in these Trogus species, which to our knowledge has not been observed in North America. Our observations provide a foundation for studying the potential evolutionary consequences of extended diapause in these multispecies interactions.

TI  - The elements of seasonal adaptations in insects
VL  - 139
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-44
AB  - The many components of seasonal adaptations in insects are reviewed, especially from the viewpoint of aspects that must be studied in order to understand the structure and purposes of the adaptations. Component responses include dispersal, habitat selection, habitat modification, resistance to cold, dryness, and food limitation, trade-offs, diapause, modifications of developmental rate, sensitivity to environmental signals, life-cycle patterns including multiple alternatives in one species, and types of variation in phenology and development. Spatial, temporal, and resource elements of the environment are also reviewed, as are environmental signals, supporting the conclusion that further understanding of all of these seasonal responses requires detailed simultaneous study of the natural environments that drive the patterns of response.

TI  - Dissecting chill coma recovery as a measure of cold resistance: evidence for a biphasic response in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 50
IS  - 8
SP  - 695-700
AB  - Cold resistance in insects has traditionally been measured in terms of survival following a stress, but alternative methods are increasingly being used because of their relevance to the ecology of organisms and their utility in characterizing variation among species, populations and individuals. One such method capable of discriminating among Drosophila species and conspecific Drosophila populations from different environments is adult chill coma recovery time, the time taken for adults to become active again after being knocked down by a cold stress. Here we characterized the chill coma response of D. melanogaster in detail. Adults were exposed to a range of temperatures and stressful periods prior to measuring recovery. Recovery from chill coma in D. melanogaster was biphasic; as flies were stressed under cooler temperatures, recovery times leveled off and then decreased before sharply increasing again as mortality starts to occur. This biphasic response has previously been observed in D. subobscura where it has a somewhat different shape. A second mechanism therefore acts at relatively lower temperatures to ameliorate the effects of the cold stress. When D. melanogaster were reared at 19 and 25degreesC for two generations, the shape of the curve relating temperature to recovery time was similar, but flies from the warmer temperature had longer recovery times and showed responses that leveled off and then decreased at relatively higher temperatures. As exposure time to cold stress was increased, recovery times also increased except at mild stress levels. Chill coma recovery in D. melanogaster is a complex trait and likely to reflect multiple underlying components. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Relating juvenile migration timing and survival to adulthood in two species of threatened Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.)
VL  - 46
IS  - 5
SP  - 983-990
AB  - 1. Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain >90% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations. 2. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. 3. In general, models with year, day and day(2) had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead. 4. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4-50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention.

TI  - Conceptual Design of a Hybrid Fusion-Fission Power Reactor with a Tokamak and a Depleted Uranium Blanket
VL  - 83
IS  - 7
SP  - 1029-1036
AB  - We assess the viability of energy generation with depleted uranium irradiated with fast neutrons from the reaction of DT fusion driven by a tokamak reactor. Since existing nuclear power plants employ uranium fuel enriched to 4.5% U-235, over 90% of natural uranium currently goes to nuclear waste and is no longer used for power generation. The amount of depleted uranium with the U-235 content of 0.2-0.3% accumulated in the world exceeds 1 500 000 t and is continually increasing owing to the operation of thermal neutron power plants. Industrial fast neutron power plants using depleted uranium as nuclear fuel are still at the development stage. Therefore, alternative approaches to utilizing depleted uranium for power generation should be considered. Compared to fast reactors with a closed cycle utilizing plutonium, the proposed facility involves less radiation hazard since the irradiated fuel has to be reprocessed and reloaded less frequently. Apart from that, the proposed hybrid power reactor operates in the deeply subcritical regime, which provides a high level of nuclear safety. A tokamak reactor similar to that of the ITER project is selected as a source of a high-power flux of fusion neutrons whereby a reactor blanket of depleted uranium is irradiated. The heat will be removed with a liquid metal coolant rather than with water as in the ITER reactor. This will help maintain the hardness of the neutron spectrum, thereby maximizing the rate of U-238 fission. With such a neutron source and a blanket of natural uranium with an optimized thickness of similar to 20 cm, each fission of uranium (with an energy release of 200 MeV) is estimated to finally produce four Pu-239 atoms in the blanket (see the 2009 proceedings of the ROSATOM commission on optimizing the development of power generation with tokamaks). This estimate equally applies to a reactor blanket of depleted uranium. According to estimates, an "ideal" reactor with a blanket of depleted uranium operating in a stationary mode with a capacity factor of 70% would generate nearly 1.5 GW of electric power. However, only an estimated one-third of the total power can actually be delivered to the electrical network since the rest is required for breeding tritium and powering the facility itself. Toward maximizing the capacity factor, the first wall of the fusion reactor will be coated with lithium for protection against plasma-induced erosion.

VL  - 19

SP  - 465-472
AB  - Photoperiod and temperature conditions known to induce diapause in tropical arthropods were tested on two generations (G(0) and G(1)) of the phytoseiid, Enseius fustis. Failure to lay eggs or a pre-oviposition period longer than 15 days were the criteria used to determine whether females were in diapause. Females reared from egg to adult and held throughout adult life under cyclic temperatures of 29/20 degrees C in combination with long photophases of 16L:8D and 14L:10D showed no indication of aestival diapause. Similarly, hibernal diapause was not induced in females reared under a constant temperature of 18 degrees C and a photophase of 8L:16D. Under the various test conditions, females initiated oviposition within an average of 4 days. Overall, pre-oviposition patterns for G(0) and G(1) females were similar under the same test conditions. Reproductive patterns based on the mean number of eggs per female per day varied only slightly between generations for the same treatments.

TI  - Hydrogen generation in a Pd membrane fuel processor: Productivity effects during methanol steam reforming
VL  - 61
IS  - 19
SP  - 6616-6636
AB  - Performance analyses are carried out for the palladium membrane fuel processor for catalytic generation of high purity hydrogen. The reactor model includes detailed particle-scale multi-component diffusion, multiple reversible reactions, flow, and membrane transport. Using methanol steam reforming on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst as the test reaction, a systematic examination of the effects of operating and reactor design parameters on key performance metrics is presented. Single particle simulations reveal a complex interplay between nonisobaric transport and the reversible reactions (methanol reforming and decomposition, and water-gas shift), which impact overall reactor performance. An analysis of characteristic times helps to identify four different productivity controlling regimes: (i) permeation control, encountered with thick membranes and/or insufficient membrane area; (ii) catalyst pore diffusion control encountered with diffusion of reacting species in larger particles; (iii) reaction control, encountered when intrinsic catalytic rates are too low because of inadequate activity or catalyst loading; and (iv) feed control, encountered when the limiting reactant feed rate is inadequate. The simulations reveal that a maximum in the hydrogen productivity occurs at an intermediate space velocity, while the hydrogen utilization is a decreasing function of space velocity, implying a trade-off between productivity and hydrogen utilization. The locus of productivity maxima itself exhibits a maximum at an intermediate membrane surface to volume ratio, the specific value of which is dependent on the particle size, membrane thickness and reaction conditions. At moderate temperature and total pressure (260 degrees C, 10 bar), particles smaller than 2 mm diameter, Pd membranes with thickness less than 10 mu m, and membrane surface to volume ratio exceeding 500 m(2)/m(3) are needed to achieve viable productivity (> 50 mol H-2/m(3) s). A comparison between the packed-bed membrane reactor and conventional packed-bed reactor indicates a modest improvement in the conversion and productivity due to in situ hydrogen removal.

VL  - 195

SP  - 19-29
AB  - The research field of perovskite based solar cells has recently been developed as the most promising candidate for next-generation because of their high efficiency solar cell technology that is compatible with low-cost, low-temperature processing, long-term stability and simple structure of solar cells production such as the hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 in solar cells have high power conversion efficiency exceeding 22%. However, the unstable nature of perovskite was observed when exposing it to continuous moisture, illumination and high temperature obstructing the commercial development in the long run and thus becoming the main problem that needs to be solved immediately. In this work, the preparation of organic - inorganic halide perovskite by mixing halide group between iodide with bromide, CH3NH3PbIxBr3-x compound under the annealing temperature condition was investigated. The structure of the product was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, High Resolution SEM image was used to study the presence morphology of crystalline domains within the sample. We examine the thermal properties of samples using Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA). To check the variation of optical properties in these compounds, we measured the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) which showed the survival of organic group. It is concluded that the annealing affects phase formation and thermal stability of CH3NH3PbIxBr3-x compounds. A small powder amount of lead bromide (PbBr2), a product of the degradation, was observed with increasing annealing temperature. Accordingly, appropriate annealing temperature should be chosen to produce a high efficiency photovoltaic.

TI  - Influenza Virus Reassortment Is Enhanced by Semi-infectious Particles but Can Be Suppressed by Defective Interfering Particles
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
AB  - A high particle to infectivity ratio is a feature common to many RNA viruses, with similar to 90-99% of particles unable to initiate a productive infection under low multiplicity conditions. A recent publication by Brooke et al. revealed that, for influenza A virus (IAV), a proportion of these seemingly non-infectious particles are in fact semi-infectious. Semi-infectious (SI) particles deliver an incomplete set of viral genes to the cell, and therefore cannot support a full cycle of replication unless complemented through co-infection. In addition to SI particles, IAV populations often contain defective-interfering (DI) particles, which actively interfere with production of infectious progeny. With the aim of understanding the significance to viral evolution of these incomplete particles, we tested the hypothesis that SI and DI particles promote diversification through reassortment. Our approach combined computational simulations with experimental determination of infection, co-infection and reassortment levels following co-inoculation of cultured cells with two distinct influenza A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2)-based viruses. Computational results predicted enhanced reassortment at a given % infection or multiplicity of infection with increasing semi-infectious particle content. Comparison of experimental data to the model indicated that the likelihood that a given segment is missing varies among the segments and that most particles fail to deliver >= 1 segment. To verify the prediction that SI particles augment reassortment, we performed co-infections using viruses exposed to low dose UV. As expected, the introduction of semi-infectious particles with UV-induced lesions enhanced reassortment. In contrast to SI particles, inclusion of DI particles in modeled virus populations could not account for observed reassortment outcomes. DI particles were furthermore found experimentally to suppress detectable reassortment, relative to that seen with standard virus stocks, most likely by interfering with production of infectious progeny from co-infected cells. These data indicate that semi-infectious particles increase the rate of reassortment and may therefore accelerate adaptive evolution of IAV.

SP  - 10067-10072
AB  - With implication of developments of plasmonic biochips, we investigated laser trapping of cyanobacteria (CB) on a gold nanostructure, where a nanopyramidal dimer array was integrated. Upon near-infrared (808 nm) laser irradiation of the sample solution, CB cells were immediately collected, trapped, and permanently fixed onto the irradiated area of the nanostructure. About 15 CB cells were fixed to form a ring pattern. Because bubble generation was always necessary for CB fixation, the fixation was not because of a plasmon-enhanced optical force but because of hydrodynamic pressure modulation and Marangoni convection around the bubble. The bubble was generated by a photothermal effect to boil water. The fixation mechanism would be analogous to that of bubble nanolithography. We examined bioactivity and viability of CB cells using fluorescence microspectroscopy. Our method would be applicable to develop living-cell-based biodevices.

TI  - Confirming the absence of nuclear warheads via passive gamma-ray measurements
VL  - 990
AB  - Arms-control agreements between the United States and Russia negotiated after the end of the Cold War have imposed limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Verification of these agreements has relied on onsite inspections, sometimes supported by radiation detection techniques to confirm the absence of a nuclear warhead when ambiguities arise. So far, these measurements have sought to detect neutron emissions associated with the presence of plutonium, but they would be inadequate for uranium devices. In an effort to offer instruments that could be used to confirm the absence of both plutonium and uranium weapons, here we propose an inspection system that uses only passive gamma radiation detection techniques. Such a system would be particularly valuable for next-generation arms-control agreements that limit total numbers of weapons and would involve containerized items in storage. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to support the development of a verification protocol and detection algorithm. We demonstrate the viability of the technique using standard laboratory check sources and MCNP simulations for simplified configurations of special nuclear material.

TI  - Asymmetrical Competition between Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) Coexisting in Breeding Sites
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus are mosquito vectors for several tropical diseases that represent a current public health problem. The ecological requirements for each species are different, however, both species show high biological adaptability, which promotes their coexistence in the same breeding sites. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of larval association between Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus under different laboratory conditions of food supply and temperature, and under field simulated conditions like peridomestic containers. Our findings showed that under field simulated conditions there was no asymmetrical competition in mixed cultures with the different Cx. quinquefasciatus/Ae. aegypti ratios tested. However, under laboratory conditions in which different doses of food supply were evaluated, it was observed that competition between the two species takes place. Larval coexistence under food scarcity conditions (0.95 mg/larva) showed that Ae. aegypti had a greater adult emergence than Cx. quinquefasciatus and was capable of depriving Cx. quinquefasciatus of the food needed to complete metamorphosis. In an intermediate dose of food (1.9 mg/larva), the dry weight of Cx. quinquefasciatus adults decreased, and their larval development time increased when Cx. quinquefasciatus/Ae. aegypti ratio was low. Also, a temperature effect was assessed demonstrating that Cx. quinquefasciatus was more vulnerable to changes in temperature. We suggest that Ae. aegypti is more successful in exploiting microhabitats when food is scarce, due to its scrape active feeding habitats and fast larval development times. Therefore, in conditions of food paucity both species will compete, and Ae. aegypti larvae will prevail.

TI  - DOES AN EXTENSION OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IN DROSOPHILA CAUSE THE PROLONGATION OF ADULT LIFE
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
SP  - 99-102
AB  - It is accepted by some authors that by stretching the developmental program, by lowering the developmental temperature in a physiological range, adult longevity can be prolonged. In order to test this hypothesis in Drosophila melanogaster two groups of flies were acclimated at 20 and 28 degrees C by self mating for 10 generations. The life tables for both sexes of the two temperature groups of flies were constructed at both temperatures. Flies raised at 28 degrees C had a very similar life span at 28 degrees C in comparison to those raised at 20 degrees C. Again the flies developed at 20 degrees C and tested at 20 degrees C did not live for a shorter period than those raised at 28 degrees C and tested at 20 degrees C. When the life spans of the two temperature groups of flies were measured at 25 degrees C, again no significant differences were observed between the averages of the flies collected from the 20 degrees C and 28 degrees C cultures. It is concluded that the life span of both male and female flies is independent of developmental temperature. The pertinent data on the subject is compared with ours and the subject evaluated.

AB  - To make laboratory studies of thermal resistance in ectotherms more ecologically relevant, temperature changes that reflect conditions experienced by individuals in nature should be used. Here we describe an assay that is useful for quantifying multiple measures of thermal resistance of individual adult flies. We use this approach to assess upper and lower thermal limits and functional thermal scope for Drosophila melanogaster and also show that the method can be used to (1) detect a previously described latitudinal cline for cold tolerance in D. melanogaster populations collected along the east coast of Australia, (2) demonstrate that acclimation at variable temperatures during development increases tolerance to both low and high thermal stresses and therefore increases thermal scope compared to acclimation at a constant temperature, (3) show that temperate populations adapted to variable thermal environments have wider thermal limits compared to those from the less variable tropics, at least when flies were reared under constant temperature conditions and (4) demonstrate that different measures of cold resistance are often not strongly correlated. Based on our findings, we suggest that the method could be routinely used in evaluating thermal responses potentially linked to ecological processes and evolutionary adaptation.

TI  - Performance assessment and economic perspectives of integrated PEM fuel cell and PEM electrolyzer for electric power generation
VL  - 7
IS  - 3
AB  - The study presents a complete one-dimensional model to evaluate the parameters that describe the operation of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and PEM fuel cell. The mathematical modeling is implemented in Matlab/Simulink (R) software to evaluate the influence of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and overpotentials on the overall performance. The models are further merged into an integrated electrolyzer-fuel cell system for electrical power generation. The operational description of the integrated system focuses on estimating the overall efficiency as a novel indicator. Additionally, the study presents an economic assessment to evaluate the cost-effectiveness based on different economic metrics such as capital cost, electricity cost, and payback period. The parametric analysis showed that as the temperature rises from 30 to 70 degrees C in both devices, the efficiency is improved between 5-20%. In contrast, pressure differences feature less relevance on the overall performance. Ohmic and activation overpotentials are highlighted for the highest impact on the generated and required voltage. Overall, the current density exhibited an inverse relation with the efficiency of both devices. The economic evaluation revealed that the integrated system can operate at variable load conditions while maintaining an electricity cost between 0.3-0.45 $/kWh. Also, the capital cost can be reduced up to 25% while operating at a low current density and maximum temperature. The payback period varies between 6-10 years for an operational temperature of 70 degrees C, which reinforces the viability of the system. Overall, hydrogen-powered systems stand as a promising technology to overcome energy transition as they provide robust operation from both energetic and economic viewpoints.

TI  - Implication viability assessment of shift to electric vehicles for present power generation scenario of India
VL  - 195
AB  - The rapid increase in population and urbanization has led to an enormous increase in the overall vehicular demand. In India, most vehicles run on conventional fuels producing harmful gases and particulate matter, causing an adverse effect on the human health & environment. Most urban cities in India are witnessing a rapid increase in the level of urban air pollution, which can be largely attributed to the continuous surge in the number of on-road vehicles. According to a KPMG report, it is estimated that by 2030 there will be a 100% incremental adoption of electric vehicles which will lead to the minimization of the pollution level generated from the conventional cars. However, in India, 57.3% of electricity is produced through coal thermal power plant. It cannot be denied that coal leaves behind harmful by-products upon combustion. The emissions from the coal power plants in India increased from 901.7 g CO2/kWh in 2005 to 926 g CO2/kWh in 2012. This is much higher than global averages in the same period, which were 542 g and 533 g CO2/kWh, respectively. The increase in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the demand for electricity, which may result in a rise in emissions from thermal power plants, thus offsetting the reductions in tailpipe emissions. This study deals with assessing the impact of shifting the fleet from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electric vehicles (EV) on power generation sources, i.e., coal power plants, and its impact on the environment in India. The implication viability of electric vehicle over internal combustion engine vehicle has been assessed with exergy analysis, taking into account the total emissions involved from well to wheel. In the current power generation scenario of India, a comparative analysis of direct and indirect emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles (powered with coal power generation) shows that electric vehicles emit less CO2 and CO, whereas SO2 and Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emisions (indirectly from the thermal power plant), are higher.

TI  - Screening strains of the mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori, for thermotolerance
VL  - 11
AB  - A tropical climate prevails in most of the sericultural areas in India, where temperature increases during the summer lead to adverse effects on temperate bivoltine silkworm rearing and cause crop losses. Screening for thermotolerance in the silkworm, Bombyxmori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for the development of thermotolerant breeds/hybrids. In the current study, the aim was to identify potential bivoltine silkworm strains specific for tolerance to high temperature. The third day of fifth stage silkworm larvae of bivoltine strains were subjected to high temperature of 36 +/- 1 degrees C with RH of 50 +/- 5 % for six hours (10:00-16:00) every day until spinning for three consecutive generations. Highly significant differences were found among all genetic traits of bivoltine silkworm strains in the treated groups. Three groups of silkworm resulted including susceptible, moderately tolerant, and tolerant by utilizing pupation rate or survival rate with thermal stress as the index for thermotolerance. Furthermore, based on the overall silkworm rearing performance of nine quantitative genetic traits such as larval weight, cocoon yield by number and weight, pupation, single cocoon and shell weight, shell ratio, filament length and denier, three bivoltine silkworm strains, BD2-S, SOF-BR and BO2 were developed as having the potential for thermotolerance. The data from the present study enhance knowledge for the development of thermo tolerant silkworm breeds/hybrids and their effective commercial utilization in the sericulture industry.

VL  - 115
SP  - 1632-1639
AB  - Combined generation of heat, cooling and power has a large potential to increase its share in distributed generation of energy. Such investments are driven by energy savings which result to operational profits. These profits are very sensitive to the prices of the competitive energy products: electricity and gas. In this work a theoretical indicator is developed between energy prices, the technical characteristics of cogeneration and conventional generation equipment and the investment viability. Through this indicator, the operational profitability of cogeneration equipment is mapped and discussed. Empirical rules are extracted which can give a clear view of the sensitivity of energy prices on energy efficiency investments. The European cogeneration status quo is analyzed in terms of energy prices and market share. The developed indicator is also used, to analyze market related barriers and highlight the importance of energy pricing policy as a tool to minimize the risk exposure of energy efficiency investments.

VL  - 14
IS  - 9
AB  - A circular (close-loop) biorefinery, which integrates wastewater treatment with the generation of an energy precursor and organic fertilizer, tested at the level of a pilot plant treating 54,000 L per day (LPD) of sewage, is described. In the biorefinery's first stage, sewage was treated in a novel SHEFROL (R) (sheet-flow-root-level) bioreactor at a very rapid rate, indicated by a hydraulic retention time of a mere 6 h, to a level that met the prevailing national standards for the discharge of treated sewage. The main bioagent of the reactor-water hyacinth-was then processed for the generation of energy precursors. For this, volatile fatty acids (VFA) were extracted in a simple batch reactor operating at ambient temperature and pressure. The 'spent' weeds were then converted into organic fertilizer, also at ambient temperature and pressure, by the high-rate vermicomposting process earlier reported by the authors. In this manner, wastewater treatment, energy production, and the generation of a fertilizer were achieved rapidly and efficiently, creating a circular close-loop system that required very little energy and materials and generated almost zero net waste.

VL  - 56

SP  - 123-131
AB  - Although the impact of warming on winter limitation of aphid populations is reasonably well understood, the impacts of hot summers and heat wave events are less clear. In this study, we address this question through a detailed analysis of the thermal ecology of three closely related aphid species: Myzus persicae, a widespread, polyphagous temperate zone pest, Myzus polaris, an arctic aphid potentially threatened by climate warming, and, Myzus ornatus, a glasshouse pest that may benefit from warming. The upper lethal limits (ULT50) and heat coma temperatures of the aphid species reared at both 15 and 20 degrees C did not differ significantly, suggesting that heat coma is a reliable indicator of fatal heat stress. Heat coma and CTmax were also measured after aphids were reared at 10 and 25 degrees C for one and three generations. The extent of the acclimation response was not influenced by the number of generations. Acclimation increased CTmax with rearing temperature for all species. The acclimation temperature also influenced heat coma; this relationship was linear for M. ornatus and M. polaris but non-linear for M. persicae (increased tolerance at 10 and 25 degrees C). Bacteria known generically as secondary symbionts can promote thermal tolerance of aphids, but they were not detected in the aphids studied here. Assays of optimum development temperature were also performed for each species. All data indicate that M. persicae has the greatest tolerance of high temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 2
IS  - 2
SP  - 61-75
AB  - This study assessed the genotype by environment (G x E) interaction for diameter growth in 15 Eucalyptus globulus progeny trials in Australia. Single-site analyses revealed significant subrace and family-within-subrace variance in all trials. Across-site subrace ((r) over cap (s)) and family ((r) over cap (f)) correlations were estimated by linear mixed model analyses of pairs of trials. Using a factor analytic structure for subrace and family random terms in a multi-environment mixed model analysis, best linear unbiased predictions of subrace effects were obtained for each trial. These were then averaged for each of four states (Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia) and across all sites. Statistically significant G x E interaction was detected, and weighted means across states for (r) over cap (s) and (r) over cap (f) were 0.73 and 0.76, respectively. Nevertheless, the three subraces from the Otway Ranges were both fast growing and relatively stable in their ranks over all sites. We evaluated the sensitivity of subraces to changing environmental conditions, on the basis of random coefficient models regressing subrace performance on selected trial climatic variables. The results suggested differential susceptibility of subraces to water; light and (to a less extent) temperature stresses during summer. Moreover, using multivariate techniques to visualize and interpret the across-site correlation structure for subrace effects, we could identify site clusters of reduced G x E interaction related to soil water availability and evaporative demand during summer. A revised site-type classification using these factors should allow a better capture of genetic gains from breeding and deployment.

VL  - 55

AB  - In the present study, seven carbohydrates were selected as encapsulant for preparing lutein microencapsulated powders (LMPs). The surface morphology, physical properties, encapsulation efficiency, and thermo- and storage stability of LMPs were studied to determine the protective effects of different carbohydrates on microencapsulated lutein during spray drying and storage. Results on powder characteristics indicated that the crystal inhibition of wall material in spray drying was necessary for decent encapsulation efficiency, and higher glass transition temperature of wall material could cause high product yield. In stability assessment, degradation kinetics of different LMPs at two different temperature conditions were analysed, revealing that inulin could provide more effective protection compared with the other carbohydrate. Our results suggested that the different carbohydrates had great influence on the quality of LMPs, and inulin could be considered as an alternative for the generation of LMPs to enhance storage stability and extend shelf life of this bioactive product.

VL  - 33
IS  - 4
SP  - 626-638
AB  - The performance of a hybrid wind-solar power plant in southwestern Minnesota is modeled for a 2-yr period using hourly wind and solar insolation data. The wind portion of the plant consists of four interconnected wind farms within a radius of 90 km. The solar component of the plant is a parabolic trough solar thermal electric generating system using a heat transfer fluid that drives a steam turbine. The market value of energy produced, retail value of energy produced, and levelized cost of energy of the hybrid plant are compared to those of an energy equivalent wind-only plant. Results show that adding solar thermal electric generating capacity to a wind farm rather than expanding with additional wind capacity provides cost-benefit trade-offs that will continue to change as the two technologies evolve. At the present time, we find that capital cost and levelized cost of energy favor a wind-only plant while electric load matching favors a hybrid wind-solar plant. Regional differences in the solar resource in the US influence the economic viability of the hybrid plant, and a comparison using the present model is made with one location in the Southwest. The hourly data analysis presented here is a possible tool for evaluating the overall economic feasibility and generating characteristics for a hybrid wind-solar thermal electric power plant for any location with available wind, solar, electric load, and price data.

Great attention is dedicated to the correct sizing of the CHP/CCHP plant both in term of energy efficiency and economic viability. A detailed building model is developed and used, through dynamic building simulation, to identify the potential energy and economic savings achievable with the installation of a CHP/CCHP sized based on the results of the simulation itself. The work proves the usefulness of dynamic energy simulation as an evaluation tool for retrofits of CHP plants and provides suggestions on the correct sizing of CHP equipment. It is also meant to prove what could be achieved if those kind of analysis were carried out during the design of the building.

TI  - Sequence-Based Analysis of Protein Energy Landscapes Reveals Nonuniform Thermal Adaptation within the Proteome
VL  - 26
IS  - 10
SP  - 2217-2227
AB  - Thermal adaptation of individual proteins is often achieved through modulating protein stability, with proteins that are adapted to extreme cold environments having increased conformational flexibility when brought to mesophilic conditions. Conversely, proteins adapted to higher temperatures appear less dynamic and tire found to be much more stable against thermal denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts. According to the current paradigm, the adaptation of an organism for survival at higher or lower temperatures is facilitated by the adaptation of the component proteins. We note, however, that these observations have been carried out on relatively few proteins. The extent to which the conformational stabilities of all members of the proteome have been modulated for thermal adaptation remains unclear, with no direct experimental strategies to address this issue. Adapted extremophilies are likely to use it Multitude of molecular and biophysical strategies for survival and, therefore, evolution of specific biophysical properties of proteins for optimal function may not be necessary for all proteins in the proteome. Using it sequence-based predictor of protein stability, eScape, an in silico examination of several extremophilic proteomes shows a correlation between the collective stability of the proteins and the thermal range of survival for the organism as expected. Unexpectedly, however, the analysis shows that protein thermostability is modified to different extents across the proteome and depends oil the functional role for which the protein is involved. Identification of these differences provides unique opportunities to study interdependence within the proteome as well as the role that the proteome plays in the process of evolutionary thermal adaptation.

VL  - 375
AB  - In the current article, which is first to a two-part study, techno-economic evaluation, viability and optimization of concentrated solar power plants considering design parameters of solar multiple and integration of thermal energy storage is performed. High frequency (10 min), validated ground datasets are used for numerical simu-lations using System Advisor Model. Techno-economic performance analysis of dry and wet cooling system equipped solar tower and parabolic trough collectors is assessed for three different climatic zones i.e. temperate, semi-arid and sub-tropical. The optimization problem intends to maximize technical potential alongside mini-mizing net cost of electricity production. It is found that on average, 60 and 75% increase in annual electricity generation, and 5 and 7% decrease in levelized cost of electricity is observed with addition of 6 h of storage for solar tower and trough plants, respectively. For cost-effective solution, optimal solar multiple and thermal energy storage combination is in range of 3-3.2 and 15.4-15.9 for solar tower, and 2.3-3 and 10.6-11.6 h for trough plants. Wet-cooled solar towers perform the best in each climatic zone offering 5-6% lower cost of electricity production and 3-7% higher electricity generation potentials. Moreover, for mutually exclusive projects, lev-elized cost of electricity is a better metric to gauge economic viability than net present value. The follow-up study (Part B) focuses on environ-economic optimization of concentrated solar power plants. Furthermore, outcomes from both optimization objectives are utilized for multi-objective optimization based 'balanced' solution assessment in the next part.

SP  - 64-69
AB  - The use of wood fuel for heat generation has been increasing steadily in re-cent years. Wood-fired heating systems do not only make economic sense for woodland owners; more and more often non-woodland owners are having their heat supplied by wood-fired power stations. Three output categories of wood-fired system were compared: 20, 60 and 100 kilowatt (kW). The cost price of the heat ranged from 16.4 to 34.0 Swiss centimes per kilowatt hour. Pellet heating was most cost-effective for the 20 kW output category, woodchip firing with tower-silo storage for outputs of 60 and 100 kW. A heat cost price comparison of heating systems with fossil energy carriers such as fuel oil and natural gas shows that medium and relatively high-output wood-burning systems cost only slightly more. An analysis of four case studies shows that investment costs can vary greatly for woodchip heating systems with comparable plant ratings. The type of woodchip storage and other operational factors can make all the difference.

AB  - Effect of different temperature degrees (10, 20 and 30 C) on the developmental stages of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani Vierek (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae), reared on mealy aphid Hyalopterus pruni (Geoffroy) was studied under laboratory conditions. As temperature increased from 10 to 30 degrees C longevity decreased. Lowest thermal threshold for the development of the parasitoid was 0.40 degrees C for eggs, 2.6 degrees C for larvae and 4.0 degrees C for pupae, while it was 2.8 degrees C for the total developmental duration from (egg to adult). Thermal constant for the development of eggs was 71.93 day degree (DD's), 103.37DD's for larvae, 94.7 DD's for pupae and 258.8 DD's for the total developmental period. The lowest thermal threshold for female longevity was 2.7 degrees C and the thermal constant was 73.63DD's, while the lowest thermal threshold for male longevity was 3.9 degrees C and the thermal constant was 45.67 DD's. Obtained results are essential information for predicting the field population of the parasitoid A. colemani and for its releasing time. Sex ratio (female: male) was 1.71:1 in the field. By rearing the parasitoid for three successive generations in laboratory, the sex ratio was almost 1:1 in the first two generations, but males were relatively higher in the third one (1:1.04)

VL  - 169
IS  - 11
SP  - 984-996
AB  - Alternative host plants are among the key factors influencing the spread of invasive pests because they are utilized as a food source and provide shelter in unfavorable conditions. The South American tomato pinworm (SATP), Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), has a high behavioral and physiological plasticity enabling it to rapidly spread in several countries. Among the multiple strategies used by SATP in the invasion process is the use of alternative host plants including black nightshade (BNS), Solanum nigrum L. (Solanaceae), a perennial plant widely distributed across all habitats worldwide. Besides the life table and behavioral parameters of SATP on tomato, its survival and reproduction in low temperatures on alternative host plants should be assessed to evaluate the likely spread in temperate regions with harsh winters. In our study, comparing solanaceous species through generations, the primary difference was in the mean generation time with SATP reared on BNS, whereby it had a longer development time than larvae and pupae reared on tomato plants. Adults preferred tomato plants even if they had been reared as larvae on BNS. Exposure periods of 7, 14, and 21 days to 4 degrees C indicated that more than 50% of SATP pupae reared on BNS plants survived more than 14 days. The survival of SATP reared on tomato plants exceeded 21 days and after exposure to 4 degrees C, females reared on both plants remained fertile. The life table and behavioral parameters recorded demonstrated a significant potential of BNS to support the development of SATP, also at low temperature. Therefore, even with effective border surveillance and phytosanitation processes in place, invasion through an alternative host is possible and difficult to detect.

TI  - Case study: plant design to obtain a diesel-like fuel from soybean oil cracking for decentralised energy generation to Brazilian isolated communities
VL  - 14
IS  - 6
SP  - 1800-1808
AB  - Based on Brazilian isolated communities' situation about absence energy distribution, mainly in the Amazon, northeastern semi-arid and isolated regions of the Savana, some alternatives should be developed to produce electric power for energy supply. Looking for the capacities and sources of these communities, the oilseed production capacity is the most promised. So, a easy to handle pilot plant for cracking oils and fats was developed to produce biofuels. This study aimed to analyse the mass and energy balances of the pilot plant to check its viability for sustainable energy supply. For this, three different cracking temperatures (663 K, 678 K and 693 K) were studied, and reaction data was collected. The physicochemical properties are similar to those of petroleum diesel, indicating that thermal cracking fuel may be a viable alternative to this fossil fuel in diesel cycle engines. The best temperature for the cracking reaction was 678 K, due to the physicochemical parameters of the biofuel produced being similar to those of fossil diesel. So, according to energy production system, the cracking temperatures 678 and 693 K are recommended.

TI  - Effect of low dissolved oxygen on survival, emergence, and drift of tropical stream macroinvertebrates
VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 251-270
AB  - The effect of different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations on the macroinvertebrate assemblages from 2 Australian tropical streams (1 upland, 1 lowland) was measured using artificial stream mesocosms. Responses to 5-d exposures were tested. Both the upland and lowland assemblages showed a similar response. Most taxa tolerated all but very low DO levels (<10% saturation), although a reduction in emergence of insect taxa at intermediate levels (25-35% and 10-20% saturation) was observed. Mayflies showed the highest sensitivity to low oxygen conditions, and lethal effects were observed at DO levels <20% saturation for several upland and lowland species. For other taxa, including several Chironomidae, mortality was observed when oxygen concentrations were below 8% saturation. A drift response was observed only when oxygen concentrations reached near lethal levels (less than or equal to10% saturation). The lack of a drift response at DO concentrations of 25 to 35% and 10 to 20% saturation indicates that, in moderately poor oxygen conditions, macroinvertebrates will remain at a location and, hence, experience sublethal effects such as suppressed emergence. It is clear that these animals can persist in hypoxic conditions in the short term. However, because of sublethal effects, understanding how low DO concentrations affect natural assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates may require studies of populations over several generations.

TI  - Infrasonic waves generated by supersonic auroral arcs
VL  - 39
AB  - A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model of infrasound propagation in a realistic atmosphere is used to provide quantitative interpretation of infrasonic waves produced by auroral arcs moving with supersonic speed. The Lorentz force and Joule heating are discussed in the existing literature as primary sources producing infrasound waves in the frequency range 0.1-0.01 Hz associated with the auroral electrojet. The results are consistent with original ideas of Swift (1973) and demonstrate that the synchronization of the speed of auroral arc and phase speed of the acoustic wave in the electrojet volume is an important condition for generation of magnitudes and frequency contents of infrasonic waves observable on the ground. The reported modeling also allows accurate quantitative reproduction of previously observed complex infrasonic waveforms including direct shock and reflected shockwaves, which are refracted back to the earth by the thermosphere.

VL  - 37

SP  - 870-883
AB  - A finite element model is developed for the frictionally excited thermoelastic instability problem in intermittent sliding contact with finite geometries and realistic friction materials. The existing analytical solutions are used to validate the method in several limiting cases. It is concluded that some caution must be taken for the commonly used strategy of assuming time-averaged frictional heat generation for intermittent contact. The predictions made by the half-plane analytical solution that assumes thermally nonconductive and rigid frictional surface considerably overestimate the dimensionless critical speeds of realistic brake or clutch systems. Longer wavelength perturbations become unstable at a dimensionless sliding speed approaching zero, as opposed to the converged value of unity in the half-plane solution. Averaging the heat input over the entire circumference is appropriate only when the period of frictional contact is longer than that of separation. These results merit the use of the finite element method in more general applications involving intermittent contact.

AB  - PMN from blood of 6 mares were separated using hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes and centrifugation. After addition of a solution of equine plasma and DMSO (5%) the PMN were frozen. A method for freezing was developed with control of temperature decreasing rate. Tempera ture curve was 4 to -70 degrees C at 1 degrees C/min, -71 to -140 degrees C at 10 degrees C/min, -140 to -196 degrees C diving. To verify cell survival rate after thawing as well as its functional capacity i.e. phagocytosis and respiratory burst (ROS) an experiment using flow cytometry assay was performed. 95.5% resp. 94.5% of propidium iodide negative PMNs indicate cell membrane integrity of both the fresh and frozen/thawed PMN populations. Phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria was similar in both populations of cells i.e. 81.0% resp. 80.0% of the fresh resp. frozen/thawed PMNs. Increasing capacity for generation of reactive oxygen species after stimulation by PMA was observed with frozen/thawed neutrophils. The results of this study indicate the practicability of the method for achieving and cryopreservation of a vital and immune competent PMN population for intended therapeutic use in susceptible mares for endometritis.

TI  - Combination of Chemo- and Biocatalysis: Conversion of Biomethane to Methanol and Formic Acid
VL  - 9
IS  - 14
AB  - In the present day, methanol is mainly produced from methane via reforming processes, but research focuses on alternative production routes. Herein, we present a chemo-/biocatalytic oxidation cascade as a novel process to currently available methods. Starting from synthetic biogas, in the first step methane was oxidized to formaldehyde over a mesoporous VOx/SBA-15 catalyst. In the second step, the produced formaldehyde was disproportionated enzymatically towards methanol and formic acid in equimolar ratio by formaldehyde dismutase (FDM) obtained from Pseudomonas putida. Two processing routes were demonstrated: (a) batch wise operation using free formaldehyde dismutase after accumulating formaldehyde from the first step and (b) continuous operation with immobilized enzymes. Remarkably, the chemo-/biocatalytic oxidation cascades generate methanol in much higher productivity compared to methane monooxygenase (MMO) which, however, directly converts methane. Moreover, production steps for the generation of formic acid were reduced from four to two stages.

TI  - Decanter system as mechanical treatment for enhancing seawater feed quality at Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant
VL  - 80
SP  - 53-60
AB  - Long-term performance of power generation and water desalination equipment depends on proper seawater quality. At Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant (SPDP), the seawater quality is very high in turbidity because of high content of silt and sand. Currently, the quality of seawater at SPDP is causing some inconvenience to the operation and maintenance of the station's equipment. This paper is aimed at assessing the viability of enhancing seawater quality for thermal and membrane desalination processes at SPDP using the pilot-scale decanter centrifuge unit as mechanical treatment. This unit has the potential to substantially lower the silt and sand concentration to an acceptable level, allowing the use of seawater safely as feed for membrane and thermal desalination units, as well as for power generation equipment. The experimental results indicated that the decanter centrifuge system is a viable mechanical process for improving the quality of the SPDP seawater feed. The system was able to treat 100% of seawater feed, with a 99.6% availability. The separated silt and sand by the decanter centrifuge unit is coming out as a fine dry powder from the solid side compartment, which can be collected and transferred out of the SPDP station. In addition, the results showed that as flow increases, the power consumption decreases, which give an indication that the power consumption for treating seawater utilizing decanter centrifuge with a bigger capacity will be in an acceptable range.

AB  - Population dynamics and production of the calanoid copepod Acartia omorii Bradford were studied from November 1986 to November 1987 in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was present in the plankton from October to July (temperature range: 8.9 to 24.3 degrees C), with peaks in February-March and June. During this period, nine generations could be detected, for which the mean population egg production rate and midstage abundance of each life stage older than naupliar Stage (N) II were determined to trace survival. The population suffered extremely high mortality during the early life stages: on average only 2.5% of the eggs produced recruited into NII. This large loss is probably concentrated within the egg stage, due to predation, including cannibalism, by omnivorous copepods, in addition to sinking loss of eggs in the water column. However, the mortality from NII to copepodite Stage (C) V was negligible, indicating low predation pressure by large carnivores. The biomass of A. omorii showed marked seasonal variations in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of each stage increased exponentially with increasing temperature. The integrated production rate of A. omorii from 7 November 1986 to 21 July 1987 was 749 mg C m(-3) or 5.62 gCm(-2).

AB  - Dense bush-like clumps of several hundred individuals of a new species of Cladorhiza (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida) were observed near methane sources in mud volcanoes, 4718 to 4943 m deep in the Barbados Trench. The sponge tissue contains 2 main morphological types of extracellular symbiotic bacteria: small rod-shaped cells and larger coccoid cells with stacked membranes. Stable carbon isotope values, the presence of methanol dehydrogenase and ultrastructural observations all indicate that at least some of the symbionts are methanotrophic. Ultrastructural evidence of intracellular digestion of the symbionts and the stable C and N values suggest that the sponge obtains a significant portion of its nutrition from the symbionts. Ultrastructure of the sponge embryo suggests direct transmission through generations in brooded embryos. The sponge also maintains a carnivorous feeding habit on tiny swimming prey, as do other cladorhizids.

AB  - We present a multi-site stochastic model for the generation of average daily temperature, which includes a flexible parametric distribution and a multivariate autoregressive process. Different versions of this model are applied to a set of 26 stations located in Switzerland. The importance of specific statistical characteristics of the model (seasonality, marginal distributions of standardized temperature, spatial and temporal dependence) is discussed. In particular, the proposed marginal distribution is shown to improve the reproduction of extreme temperatures (minima and maxima). We also demonstrate that the frequency and duration of cold spells and heat waves are dramatically underestimated when the autocorrelation of temperature is not taken into account in the model. An adequate representation of these characteristics can be crucial depending on the field of application, and we discuss potential implications in different contexts (agriculture, forestry, hydrology, human health).

VL  - 85
IS  - 3
SP  - 281-291
AB  - One mechanism for generation of multiple antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria involves the global regulatory system marRAB. The operon, when induced, encodes for resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated antibiotics. Exposure of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to increasing levels of chloramphenicol (CHL) resulted in survival of mutants that were resistant to the inducing agent and to tetracycline (TET), nalidixic acid (NAL), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). A mutant (RU122) that lacks MarR, the transcriptional repressor of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) operon, served as a genetic tool to study the role of MarR in growth of E. coli O157:H7. No significant difference (P>0.05) was observed in growth curves of the wild-type or the mutant under the conditions examined (rich and minimal media, acidic conditions, and temperatures from 24 to 42 C). A preconditioned mutant (indRU122; cultured for 17 h in Luria-Bertani (LB) containing chloramphenicol and then examined) exhibited greater growth under all treatments tested compared to the mutant. marCRAB of E. coli O157:H7 was sequenced and compared to other known mar sequences to determine divergence from other bacteria (Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter).

AB  - The tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F) is thought to be a pest that migrates each year from warmer southern latitudes to colder areas where it cannot survive cold temperatures during the winter Although northwestern Mississippi is south of 40 degrees N latitude, which is recognized as the upper boundary for overwintering survival of the insect it is commonly believed that increasing abundance during the spring in this area is because of migration of moths from the south In this study we used a 10-year set of captures of tobacco budworm male moths from pheromone traps and air temperatures from the area as well as data on development of tobacco budworm in incubators at a range of constant temperatures Results indicated that moths that produced eggs before the 258(th) day of the year have time to accumulate the necessary degree days to produce the last generation of that year while moths that produced eggs between days 258 and 277 give raise to the first spring generation Moths reproductively active after day 277 will not under the hypothesis of no larval overwintering survival produce a generation the following year in northwestern Mississippi Moths reproductively active between days 80 and 124 will produce the generation observed between days 136 and 162 there is a gap between generations and this gap will separate generations all year Because we observed generations overlapping in the data from the pheromone traps there is a possibility that larval overwintering survival might explain the dynamics of the insect in this area

TI  - Forward genetics in Wolbachia: Regulation of Wolbachia proliferation by the amplification and deletion of an addictive genomic island
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - Author summary Insects often carry bacteria that live within their cells and are transmitted from the mother to the progeny. Wolbachia is one the most common of such bacteria and can strongly influence the insect biology. Its capacity to protect some hosts from viral infection is being used in the fight against mosquitoes-transmitted viruses by introducing Wolbachia in these insects. The amount of Wolbachia within the host can impact their interaction and must be well controlled. To understand this process we screened for new mutants of Wolbachia that proliferate too much in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We identified two mutants and characterized them in detail. One mutant has too many copies of a specific set of genes, confirming previous similar results. However, the other mutant Wolbachia lost those exact same genes, showing that they are particularly important in growth regulation. Moreover, we show that proliferation of different Wolbachia variants depends on temperature, and the developmental stage of the insect host. Finally, the data indicate that protection to viruses and cost of Wolbachia depend on related but different aspects of this control of growth. In summary, we show that we can screen for new mutants of Wolbachia and understand better how control of growth is genetically controlled by Wolbachia. Wolbachia is one of the smost prevalent bacterial endosymbionts, infecting approximately 40% of terrestrial arthropod species. Wolbachia is often a reproductive parasite but can also provide fitness benefits to its host, as, for example, protection against viral pathogens. This protective effect is currently being applied to fight arboviruses transmission by releasing Wolbachia-transinfected mosquitoes. Titre regulation is a crucial aspect of Wolbachia biology. Higher titres can lead to stronger phenotypes and fidelity of transmission but can have a higher cost to the host. Since Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, its fitness depends on host fitness, and, therefore, its cost to the host may be under selection. Understanding how Wolbachia titres are regulated and other aspects of Wolbachia biology has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools. Here we developed a forward genetic screen to identify new Wolbachia over-proliferative mutant variants. We characterized in detail two new mutants, wMelPop2 and wMelOctoless, and show that the amplification or loss of the Octomom genomic region lead to over-proliferation. These results confirm previous data and expand on the complex role of this genomic region in the control of Wolbachia proliferation. Both new mutants shorten the host lifespan and increase antiviral protection. Moreover, we show that Wolbachia proliferation rate in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the interaction between Octomom copy number, the host developmental stage, and temperature. Our analysis also suggests that the life shortening and antiviral protection phenotypes of Wolbachia are dependent on different, but related, properties of the endosymbiont; the rate of proliferation and the titres near the time of infection, respectively. We also demonstrate the feasibility of a novel and unbiased experimental approach to study Wolbachia biology, which could be further adapted to characterize other genetically intractable bacterial endosymbionts.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Robust Optimization Methodology for Generator Sizing of a Microgrid
VL  - 9
SP  - 142264-142275
AB  - Microgrids provide multiple benefits to end-use customers and electric utilities, including enhanced reliability and resilience, reduced operational costs, streamlined renewable generation integration, and improved energy efficiency. However, the microgrid technology's large capital cost remains a major barrier to establishing its economic viability. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a practical methodology for microgrid generation sizing. The proposed methodology uses the concept of robust optimization and a multi-criteria decision-making process, taking overall cost, emission reduction, and demand response into account as important factors in optimal generation sizing. The objective is to minimize the supply gap throughout the year, which is defined as the unmet load or required load curtailment under various load and solar generation scenarios. Numerical simulations on a real-world microgrid, ComEd's Bronzeville Community Microgrid (BCM) on Chicago's South Side, exhibit the practicality of the proposed method and its applications for electric utilities. The study proposes an optimal size of 4.8 MW considering the commercially available generator sizes for the BCM, which has a total peak load of 7 MW, 0.75 MW of PV and 0.5MW/2MWh of Battery energy storage installed.

AB  - A series of comprehensive and systematic experimental data and log data of lower Cambrian Qongzhusi Formation, from the first successful Well Jin-1 in western Sichuan Basin, were analyzed to investigate the properties of lower Cambrian organic-rich shale and to illustrate its shale gas potential, so as to investigate the factors affecting shale gas potential in overmature and ultratight shale. Trace element ratios (V/Cr and Ni/Co) and the concentrations of Cu + Zn imply the lower Cambrian shale deposited under suboxic anoxic bottom water with high primary productivity. The organic matter is enriched in Qiongzhusi Formation as sapropelic (type I) mainly, and R-o (2.65-2.97%) values indicate the organic matter is in the overmature stage. Pores are dominated by organic pores in lower organic-rich shale and by inorganic intragranular and intergranular pores in upper organic-rich shale. Generally, organic-rich shale was deposited in anoxic shelf (high ratios of V/Cr and Ni/Co) with high productivity (high concentration of Cu + Zn), and shale gas has accumulated and been preserved in the region with stable tectonic setting. Comprehensive analysis of the properties in overmature shales (Marcellus, Longmaxi, and Qiongzhusi) and their effect on shale gas shows that (a) organic matter formed a material basis for shale gas generation, (b) porosity provided the capacity for shale gas accumulation, and (c) moderately high thermal maturity (R-o up to 3%) improved the storage space through elevating porosity. This indicates that total organic carbon, porosity, and thermal maturity in overmature shales are the main factors affecting shale gas accumulation.

VL  - 10
IS  - 7
AB  - Nanostructured alloy powders of SmCo5+ 10 wt% Fe obtained using recycled material were studied for the first time. The SmCo(5)precursor was obtained from commercial magnets recycled by hydrogen decrepitation. The results were compared with identically processed samples obtained using virgin SmCo(5)raw material. The samples were synthesized by dry high-energy ball-milling and subsequent heat treatment. Robust soft/hard exchange coupling was observed-with large coercivity, which is essential for commercial permanent magnets. The obtained energy products for the recycled material fall between 80% and 95% of those obtained when using virgin SmCo5, depending on milling and annealing times. These results further offer viability of recycling and sustainability in production. These powders and processes are therefore candidates for the next generation of specialized and nanostructured exchange-coupled bulk industrial magnets.

VL  - 160

SP  - 569-581
AB  - We studied the importance of selection and constraint in determining the limits of adaptive radiation and the consequences of adaptive radiation in an experimental system. We propagated four replicate lines of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens derived from a single ancestral clone in 95 environments, where growth was limited by the availability of a single carbon source for 1, 000 generations. We then assayed the growth of the ancestral clone and the evolved lines in all 95 environments. Evolved lines increased their performance in almost every selection environment and invaded 70% of the novel environments as a direct response to selection. Direct responses tended to be larger in environments where growth was initially poor. Although evolved lines lost the ability to grow on about three substrates that their ancestor could readily grow on, the correlated response to selection was, on average, positive. The correlated response allowed all of our evolved populations to expand their niches and to occupy collectively the remaining novel habitats. This is inconsistent with classical theories of niche evolution. In the most extreme cases, adaptation occurred through "roundabout selection": lineages became adapted to an environment through selection in another environment but not through selection in the environment itself. Our results indicate that mutation accumulation by neutral drift was responsible for generating the majority of costs of adaptation.

TI  - Combined 'heat flow and strength' optimization of geometry: mechanical structures most resistant to thermal attack
VL  - 47
IS  - 14
SP  - 3477-3489
AB  - This paper outlines a new direction for fundamental heat transfer: a multidisciplinary approach (combined heat transfer and strength of materials) in the conceptual design of structures that have two functions, mechanical strength and resistance (survival) in the presence of sudden thermal attack. The two functions are considered simultaneously, from the start of conceptual design. This is unlike traditional approaches, where structures are optimized for mechanical strength alone, or for thermal resistance alone. In the first part of the paper, the profile of a beam loaded in bending is optimized by maximizing the lifetime in the presence of sudden heating. The propagation of the heat wave through the beam causes softening, because of the gradual transition from elastic behavior to thermoplastic behavior. In the second part of the paper, the subject is a beam of concrete reinforced with steel bars. It is shown that the clash between the mechanical and thermal objectives of the beam generates the shape of the beam cross-section, and the position of the steel bars in the beam cross-section. The generation of optimal architecture for maximal global performance under global constraints in freely morphing systems is constructal design. On the background of the constructal architectures that have been developed so far, the present paper outlines the first steps toward the constructal design of multiobjective (multidisciplinary) architectures.

VL  - 103
IS  - 3
SP  - 389-394
AB  - Technical viability of two small-scale electricity generation pathways based on willow short rotation coppice biomass was evaluated using a Screening Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) procedure. The system inputs included fuel and oil consumption in machine operations, fertilizer and herbicide production, transportation of willow chips biomass, and biomass-to-energy conversion. The analysis was based on net energy production, energy output-input ratio, and the related CO2 emission. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of fertilizer type and application technique, harvesting and drying techniques, energy conversion process and chips transportation distance. The results showed that key energy efficiency and environmental compatibility factors include: the choice of drying technique; fertilizer type and application technique (68.2% variation in net energy, 57.7% difference in output-input ratio, respectively), and; the type of biomass-to-energy conversion plant, which had up to 36.4% variation in net energy production, and 96.4% reduction in CO2 emission. Willow chips transportation up to distances of 38 km did not have significant impact on the net energy production and CO2 emission. Chip transportation over distances in excess of 38 km generated significant drop in energy efficiency (25.9% reduction in energy output-input ratio) which underlines the importance of transportation in the overall system productivity.

TI  - Intraspecific hybridization as a mitigation strategy of low salinity in marine bivalve noble scallop Chlamys nobilis
VL  - 552
AB  - Noble scallop Chlamys nobilis is one of the most important bivalves in China. C. nobilis aquaculture is mainly carried out in coastal areas that vulnerable to high salinity fluctuations. Hyposaline conditions caused by a large volume of freshwater input from rivers in rainy seasons often leads to mass mortalities of farmed C. nobilis. Interspecific hybridization is a promising approach to improve the growth rate, survival rate and environmental adaptability of bivalves. However, it is not clear whether intraspecific hybridization can be used as a management strategy to mitigate the impact of hyposaline on farmed C. nobilis. Therefore, this study compared the effects of hyposaline on the growth rate, survival rate, total carotenoid content (TCC) and transcriptome data of intraspecific inbred and hybrid C. nobilis. The results of this study revealed that intraspecific hybridization of C. nobilis exhibited significant positive heterosis in growth rate, survival rate and adaptation to hyposaline condition. The stronger adaptation to hyposaline condition is mainly attributed to the induction of genes involved in osmoregulation, cell protection and damaged protein repair. Therefore, intraspecific hybridization is a potential management strategy to mitigate the impact of hyposaline on farmed bivalves (at least for C. nobilis).

TI  - Preparation, properties and future perspectives of nanocrystals from agro-industrial residues: a review of recent research
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
SP  - 131-145
AB  - Nanocellulose producing from wood pulp and its derivatives is a well-known and characterized industrial process. However, agro-industrial residues can also be used for this process as they have a high content of lignocellulosic portions, particularly cellulose. Usually discarded or used as animal feed their composition pose a great potential for the generation of value added products. As an alternative to wood pulp, cellulose from residues represent a great source for obtaining nanocellulose due to its wide availability and low cost. Given that many other studies have focused on generating nanocellulose out of wood pulp due to its intrinsic characteristics, such as high aspect ratio, biodegradability, and good overall mechanical properties, it was decided to characterize the processing of agro-industrial residues on last decade in this review as their composition greatly varies among plant sources, presenting influence on produced nanocrystals quality. The intrinsic properties of nanocellulose justify its utilization in many applications, including use in food, cosmetic, and material industry. This review attempts to follow through the state-of-art for crystalline nanocellulose preparation, presenting its current concerns in process and commercial viability, and finally, indicating some future perspectives on using agro-industrial residues as an environmentally-friendly alternative to wood sources.

TI  - Generation of clonal zebrafish line by androgenesis without egg irradiation
VL  - 5
AB  - Generation of clonal zebrafish will facilitate large-scale genetic screening and help us to overcome other biological and biotechnological challenges due to their isogenecity. However, protocols for the development of clonal lines have not been optimized. Here, we sought to develop a novel method for generation of clonal zebrafish by androgenesis induced by cold shock. Androgenetic zebrafish doubled haploids (DHs) were induced by cold shock of just-fertilized eggs, and the eggs were then heat shocked to double the chromosome set. The yield rate of putative DHs relative to the total number of eggs used was 1.10% +/- 0.19%. Microsatellite genotyping of the putative DHs using 30 loci that covered all 25 linkage groups detected no heterozygous loci, confirming the homozygosity of the DHs. Thus, a clonal line was established from sperm of a DH through a second cycle of cold-shock androgenesis and heat-shock chromosome doubling, followed by genetic verification of the isogenic rate confirming the presence of identical DNA fingerprints by using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. In addition, our data provided important insights into the cytological mechanisms of cold-shock-induced androgenesis.

TI  - Optimization of dilute acid pretreatment of barley husk and oat husk and determination of their chemical composition
VL  - 25
IS  - 11
SP  - 6377-6393
AB  - The pretreatment of renewable resources is the first step to make them metabolically available for microorganisms for generation of value-added products by fermentation. In this research, barley husk (BH) and oat husk (OH) were used as renewable resources to study the optimization of dilute acid pretreatment conditions by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Temperature (T, 110-130 degrees C), solid-to-liquid ratio (S:L, 1:8-1:16 w/v), dilute sulfuric acid concentration (DSA, 1-5%, v/v), and pretreatment time (t, 30-90min) were selected as independent variables. Their levels were specified by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method according to statistically significance level (p=0.05). OFAT results indicated that the independent variables for optimization of acid pretreatment conditions of the renewable resources were T (120-130 degrees C), S:L (1:8-1:12 w/v), and DSA (1-3% v/v) for BH; T (120-130 degrees C), S:L (1:8-1:12 w/v), and t (10-30min) for OH. Optimum pretreatment values were 130 degrees C, 1:8 (w/v), 1.86% (v/v), and 30min for BH and 130 degrees C, 1:8 (w/v), 1% (v/v), and 19min for OH by using Box-Behnken RSM. Under optimal conditions, fermentable sugar concentration, total phenolics, and extract yield were determined to be 76.28, 1.12g/L, and 55% for BH and 59.63g/L, 0.70g/L, and 56% for OH, respectively. Additionally, the chemical composition of hydrolysates was also evaluated in terms of maltose, glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, phenolics, 5-hydroxymthylfurfural, 2-furaldehyde (2-F), formic acid, and acetic acid. Catalytic efficiency values of sulfuric acid for BH and OH were 21.58 and 8.35g/g, respectively. Consequently, this study clearly indicates that the hydrolysates from the renewable resources can be used as feedstocks for the production of value-added products by biotechnological processes.

SP  - 467-473
AB  - The effects of temperature on population characteristics of Artemia sinica Cai from Yanchi Saltlake, Shanxi province, China, were studied in the laboratory at a salinity of 60parts per thousand. The developmental stages and generation time were dramatically shortened with increasing water temperature between 16degreesC and 34degreesC. Hatching and survival rates decreased rapidly above 30degreesC. The optimum temperature for reproduction and population growth was 26-28degreesC. The threshold temperatures for hatching of eggs and development of larvae were 9.07degreesC and 11.00degreesC, respectively. The effective cumulative temperature for a generation (time x temperature required from hatching to death) was 458.4+/-39.6 C degree-days. Based on field monitoring, Yanchi Saltlake provides favorable annual conditions of 2884.1 C degree-days, which would support an estimated 6.3+/-0.5 A. sinica generations,per year. The intrinsic and finite rates of population increase were both increased with adapted water temperature. Extrapolating this data to Yanchi Saltlake, the period from the middle of May to September (second to fifth A. sinica generations) would be the most productive, with a generation time of < 42 d, a population doubling time of < 15 d, a finite rate of increase of > 1.0 d(-1), and an intrinsic rate of natural increase of > 0.04 d(-1).

VL  - 114

SP  - 201-208
AB  - The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), native to Northeast Asia, is the most destructive invasive ash (Fraxinus spp.) pest in the United States. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of exposure of diapausing mature fourth instars (J-shaped larvae, JL) of EAB to cool temperatures, either 1.7 or 12.8 degrees C for 1-9 mo, on their post-chill development including adult emergence, longevity, and lifetime fecundity under standard rearing conditions (26 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D). In addition, we determined the effect of different stages of the larvae chilled at 12.8 degrees C for 3 mo on the subsequent post-chill development to EAB adults. Findings from the study revealed that a period (>= 2 mo) of chill at 12.8 degrees C is required for the termination of the EAB diapause. However, chill treatment of the larvae at the near zero temperature (1.7 degrees C) does not result in the post-diapause larval development to adults, regardless of the chill time (1-9 mo). In addition, our results showed that chill treatment of immature young larvae (L1-L4 prior to JL) results in little production of EAB adults, indicating that EAB diapause predominantly as JL. Findings of this study may be useful to laboratory rearing of EAB from eggs through continuous generations and help us understand the pest's voltinism resulting from the diapause and post-diapause development under different climatic conditions.

SP  - 5194-5201
AB  - In the historiography of post-Communist nations, historical genres such as political history and social history is more often, not discussed in the classroom, allowing for a qualitatively weak background in the social sciences as well as collective memory. For the successive generations who have completed secondary education since 1989 this is proving fertile ground for "lost" generations in Central Europe and Slovakia in particular, giving a challenge to instructors who facilitate courses and discussions on this period of history and post-Cold War political and economic developments. Moreover, for instructors from Western Europe and North American education systems, the level of standardization of instruction typical in the secondary education level is familiar to practitioners, however it is lacking in central and Eastern Europe where textbook and education reform has been undertaken in a highly charged political atmosphere. The result has been haphazard at best with political and social history after 1968 largely ignored besides a few specific events. For instruction at the university level, undertaken by expatriate lecturers, holding class discussions on subjects such as 'shock therapy' or 'turncoats' often is a lesson on the event or person instead of the intended intellectual exploration. The following paper concentrates on the challenges teaching and facilitating classroom discussions by expatriate teachers in Slovakia from the period 1998-2013 on the heritage of communism to the present political, socio-cultural, and economic system.

AB  - The article deals with justification to choose optimal thermodynamic condiions to generate porous ammonium nitrate in the vortex granulators. Advantages of granules modification are justified by way of humidification and further thermal treatment. The necessity to improve technologies for porous ammonium nitrate generation is shown with aim to form meso- and macropores on the surface of the granule and inside it. The internal and surface structure of granules is studied under different thermal treatment regimes. The results of experimental research allow to define the temperature of heat transfer agent in the working area of the vortex granulator during the proper time and to implement this index to calculate heating up kinetics and granule dehydration. Specification of the heat transfer agent's temperature index lets to perform computations, determining minimum time for granule drying, in order to avoid its unintended overheating and core destruction.

TI  - Galactosylated reversible hydrogels as scaffold for HepG2 spheroid generation
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
SP  - 1965-1974
AB  - Various galactosylated scaffolds have been developed for hepatocyte culture because galactose ligands help maintain cell viability, facilitate the formation of multicellular spheroids and help maintain a high level of liver-specific functions. However, it is difficult to harvest the cell spheroids generated inside the three-dimensional scaffolds for their further biological analysis and applications. Here we developed a new galactosylated hydrogel scaffold which solidifies in situ upon heating to physiological temperature, but liquefies again upon cooling back to room temperature. The new scaffold is composed of poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Because of the thermosensitivity of PNIPAM microgel, the mixed dispersions gel upon heating and liquefy upon cooling. PEG was added to reduce the shrinkage of the gels. Part of the PNIPAM microgel was replaced with a galactosylated one to provide a series of blend gels with various galactose ligand contents. HepG2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, were encapsulated in the in situ-formed gels. As expected, the cell viability increases with increasing content of galactose ligands. In addition, compact multicellular spheroids were obtained in gels containing galactose ligands, while loose spheroids formed in gel without galactose ligands. The cells cultured in galactose-containing gels also exhibit a higher level of liver-specific functions, in terms of both albumin secretion and urea synthesis, than those cultured in gel without these ligands. The new galactosylated scaffold not only promotes the formation of hepatocyte spheroids, but also allows for their harvest. By cooling back to room temperature to liquefy the gel, the hepatocyte spheroids can be facilely harvested from the scaffold. The reversible galactosylated scaffold developed here may be used for large scale fabrication of hepatocyte spheroids. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

TI  - Recent advances on food waste pretreatment technology via microalgae for source of polyhydroxyalkanoates
VL  - 293
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable and biocompatible polyester which are biosynthesized from the intracellular cells of microalgae through the cultivation of organic food waste medium. Before cultivation process, food waste must undergo several pre-treatment techniques such as chemical, biological, physical or mechanical in order to solubilize complex food waste matter into simpler micro- and macronutrients in which allow bio-valorisation of microalgae and food waste compound during the cultivation process. This work reviews four microalgae genera namely Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Botryococcus, are selected as suitable species due to rapid growth rate, minimal nutrient requirement, greater adaptability and flexibility prior to lower the overall production cost and maximized the production of PHAs. This study also focuses on the different mode of cultivation for the accumulation of PHAs followed by cell wall destabilization, extraction, and purification. Nonetheless, this review provides future insights into enhancing the productivity of bioplastic derived from microalgae towards low-cost, large-scale, and higher productivity of PHAs.

TI  - Environmental and Evolutionary Drivers of the Modular Gene Regulatory Network Underlying Phenotypic Plasticity for Stress Resistance in the Nematode Caenorhabditis remanei
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SP  - 969-982
AB  - Organisms can cope with stressful environments via a combination of phenotypic plasticity at the individual level and adaptation at the population level. Changes in gene expression can play an important role in both. Significant advances in our understanding of gene regulatory plasticity and evolution have come from comparative studies in the field and laboratory. Experimental evolution provides another powerful path by which to learn about how differential regulation of genes and pathways contributes to both acclimation and adaptation. Here we present results from one such study using the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. We selected one set of lines to withstand heat stress and another oxidative stress. We then compared transcriptional responses to acute heat stress of both and an unselected control to the ancestral population using a weighted gene coexpression network analysis, finding that the transcriptional response is primarily dominated by a plastic response that is shared in the ancestor and all evolved populations. In addition, we identified several modules that respond to artificial selection by (1) changing the baseline level of expression, (2) altering the magnitude of the plastic response, or (3) a combination of the two. Our findings therefore reveal that while patterns of transcriptional response can be perturbed with short bouts of intense selection, the overall ancestral structure of transcriptional plasticity is largely maintained over time.

TI  - Experimental results for an addressable xenon microdischarge EUV source array for HVM lithography
VL  - 6517
AB  - The joint specification projected in-band EUV power requirements at the intermediate focus will rise beyond 185W 2%-bw to maintain the necessary 80-100WPH throughput for economic viability. New improvements in photon efficiency and mask illumination are needed to reduce reflections and power demand, as well as improving source spatial uniformity. In 2006, Starfire presented a novel approach to the EUV source-optic architecture using a high-brightness light source array for direct integration within the illumination optical system. Spatial uniformity and Kohler illumination across the entrance pupil is achieved by dividing the incident light into discrete bundles on a fly's eye mirror. These light bundles form a secondary source image plane that is projected onto the pupil of the projection optics. This configuration allows electronic adjustment of partial coherence and depth of focus for improved lithographic contrast and resolving capability. By distributing total EUV power across discrete units, thermal and particle loadings become manageable without the need for exotic materials or cooling schemes and sources of contaminating debris are reduced. Experimental data from a 5x5 xenon-fed microdischarge source array is presented, demonstrating repetition rate and source addressability for illumination patterning and grayscaling capability. In addition, experimental data from xenonbased sources will be presented with a suite of plasma and optical diagnostic instruments, including conversion efficiency, spectral purity and debris generation. Projections for scaling to HVM conditions will also be presented.

TI  - Interaction of ATP with a Small Heat Shock Protein from Mycobacterium leprae: Effect on Its Structure and Function
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) is an important phosphate metabolite abundantly found in Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. This pathogen does not derive ATP from its host but has its own mechanism for the generation of ATP. Interestingly, this molecule as well as several antigenic proteins act as bio-markers for the detection of leprosy. One such bio-marker is the 18 kDa antigen. This 18 kDa antigen is a small heat shock protein (HSP18) whose molecular chaperone function is believed to help in the growth and survival of the pathogen. But, no evidences of interaction of ATP with HSP18 and its effect on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are available in the literature. Here, we report for the first time evidences of "HSP18-ATP" interaction and its consequences on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18. TNP-ATP binding experiment and surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that HSP18 interacts with ATP with a sub-micromolar binding affinity. Comparative sequence alignment between M. leprae HSP18 and alpha B-crystallin identified the sequence 49KADSLDIDIE58 of HSP18 as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. Molecular docking studies revealed that beta 4-beta 8 groove/strands as an ATP interactive region in M. leprae HSP18. ATP perturbs the tertiary structure of HSP18 mildly and makes it less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage. ATP triggers exposure of additional hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18 and induces more stability against chemical and thermal denaturation. In vitro aggregation and thermal inactivation assays clearly revealed that ATP enhances the chaperone function of HSP18. Our studies also revealed that the alteration in the chaperone function of HSP18 is reversible and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. As the availability and binding of ATP to HSP18 regulates its chaperone function, this functional inflection may play an important role in the survival of M. leprae in hosts.

SP  - 154-160
AB  - The native lace bug, Leptoypha mutica Say (Hemiptera: Tingidae), has demonstrated potential as an insect biological control agent of invasive Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour). To better evaluate its potential to establish on a new host, developmental biology on Chinese privet was studied at temperatures of 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C, and 32 degrees C. The complete duration of development of L. mutica from egg deposition through five instars on this previously unreported host ranged from 24.4 to 57.1 d. Estimated threshold temperatures and calculated thermal unit requirements for egg development were 11.0 degrees C and 211.9 degree-days (DD); for nymphal development, 9.9 degrees C and 326.8 DD; and for complete development, 10.5 degrees C and 527.4 DD. Results of this study indicate that L. mutica will oviposit and can develop successfully on Chinese privet over a range of temperatures suggesting the potential for multiple generations to occur in a single season.

TI  - Weekly weather generation for a nitrogen turnover model
VL  - 73
IS  - 2
SP  - 257-266
AB  - Three methods of deriving weather for use in a nitrogen decision support system with a weekly time-step are described and evaluated. The simplest of these is simply the mean (M) of the three weather variables: Rainfall (R), evapotranspiration (ET) and temperature (T). To represent the variability of weather, many sets of generated data are needed but this is not possible with mean values. Two methods of generating rainfall are described: a fully stochastic simulator (FS) and a method based on partitioning the distribution into sections (SM). Temperature, T, and evapotranspiration ET are represented in both generators by sinusoidal functions. The amount of R is modelled as an empirical distribution, rain persistence as a Markov chain. All three means of deriving weather were compared directly with actual weather from the historical record and in use with the SUNDIAL DSS. The mean values of R, ET and T were reproduced satisfactorily (r > 0.99) by both FS and SM, but variability less accurately (r > 0.80 for the standard deviations of T, r > 0.97 for R and ET). The mean values of several components of the nitrogen cycle simulated with SUNDIAL were generally reproduced well for both methods of weather generation, but less accurately for mean weather. For leaching, the root mean square errors were 2.6, 2.3 and 11.4 kg/ha for FS, SM and M, respectively. The sectioning method generally gave a poor estimate of variation, which was significantly underestimated for the majority of variables, in the case of leaching by a factor of three. Where variance is important, FS is preferred; weather data generated by this method may be used with confidence for risk assessments of denitrication and crop N uptake.

TI  - A Critical Review of CO2 Capture Technologies and Prospects for Clean Power Generation
VL  - 12
IS  - 21
AB  - With rapid growth in global demand for energy, the emission of CO2 is increasing due to the use of fossil fuels in power plants. Effective strategies are required to decrease the industrial emissions to meet the climate change target set at 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Carbon capture and storage have been recognized as the most useful methods to reduce the CO2 emissions while using fossil fuels in power generation. This work reviews different methods and updates of the current technologies to capture and separate CO2 generated in a thermal power plant. Carbon capture is classified in two broad categories depending on the requirement of separation of CO2 from the gases. The novel methods of oxy combustion and chemical looping combustion carbon capture have been compared with the traditional post combustion and precombustion carbon capture methods. The current state of technology and limitation of each of the processes including commonly used separation techniques for CO2 from the gas mixture are discussed in this review. Further research and investigations are suggested based on the technological maturity, economic viability, and lack of proper knowledge of the combustion system for further improvement of the capture system.

TI  - Water reclamation and sludge recycling scenarios for sustainable resource management in a wastewater treatment plant in Kinmen islands, Taiwan
VL  - 152
SP  - 369-378
AB  - Sustainable resource management in small islands is very challenging. To address the challenges, four water and waste management strategies were proposed for a wastewater treatment plant in the Kinmen islands, Taiwan. Life cycle assessment was employed for evaluation of the environmental impacts and benefits (i.e., avoidance of impacts) associated with the resource management strategies at the plant. The results showed that the energy requirements (mainly electricity consumption) for water and sludge treatments in the wastewater treatment plant had the most remarkable impact as high as 98.6%. Significant environmental advantages could be achieved by reusing the reclaimed wastewater for agricultural applications (27.8% reduction in eutrophication potential), reusing the sludge for land applications (157% reduction in global warming potential), and generating energy from incineration of recycled sludge (impacts were neutralized). Impacts from addition of tertiary treatment for wastewater reclamation could be offset by preventing discharge of nutrients (i.e. N and P) into the environment. The reclamation also reduced the demand from groundwater pumping and associated impacts. Reuse of sludge for energy generation was more favorable than for land applications. This was mainly because eutrophication impact could not be avoided when the sludge was applied to soil (excess in nutrients), and, relatively higher reduction in global warming potential was observed for energy generation (-197 kg CO2 eq/m(3)) than for land applications (-18.8 kg CO2 eq/m(3)).

TI  - Continental-scale tree-ring-based projection of Douglas-fir growth: Testing the limits of space-for-time substitution
VL  - 26
IS  - 9
SP  - 5146-5163
AB  - A central challenge in global change research is the projection of the future behavior of a system based upon past observations. Tree-ring data have been used increasingly over the last decade to project tree growth and forest ecosystem vulnerability under future climate conditions. But how can the response of tree growth to past climate variation predict the future, when the future does not look like the past? Space-for-time substitution (SFTS) is one way to overcome the problem of extrapolation: the response at a given location in a warmer future is assumed to follow the response at a warmer location today. Here we evaluated an SFTS approach to projecting future growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a species that occupies an exceptionally large environmental space in North America. We fit a hierarchical mixed-effects model to capture ring-width variability in response to spatial and temporal variation in climate. We found opposing gradients for productivity and climate sensitivity with highest growth rates and weakest response to interannual climate variation in the mesic coastal part of Douglas-fir's range; narrower rings and stronger climate sensitivity occurred across the semi-arid interior. Ring-width response to spatial versus temporal temperature variation was opposite in sign, suggesting that spatial variation in productivity, caused by local adaptation and other slow processes, cannot be used to anticipate changes in productivity caused by rapid climate change. We thus substituted only climate sensitivities when projecting future tree growth. Growth declines were projected across much of Douglas-fir's distribution, with largest relative decreases in the semiarid U.S. Interior West and smallest in the mesic Pacific Northwest. We further highlight the strengths of mixed-effects modeling for reviving a conceptual cornerstone of dendroecology, Cook's 1987 aggregate growth model, and the great potential to use tree-ring networks and results as a calibration target for next-generation vegetation models.

TI  - Flexible power generation scenarios for biogas plants operated in Germany: impacts on economic viability and GHG emissions
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-80
AB  - Biogas plants enable power to be generated in a flexible way so that variable, renewable energy sources can be integrated into the energy system. In Germany, the Renewable Energy Sources Act promotes flexible power generation in biogas plants. Two existing biogas plants in flexible operation were analyzed with respect to economic viability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to assess the feasibility of flexible operation. To do this, a biogas technology simulation model was developed to reproduce the technical design of both biogas plants and to link this design with twelve flexibilization scenarios. The evaluation of the economic viability is based on a discounting method of investment appraisal. For assessing the level of GHG emissions, the life cycle assessment method has been applied. The results show that the profitability of flexibilization is contingent upon premium payments promoting flexibility and direct sales resulting from a higher electrical efficiency of new or additionally installed combined heat and power units. Overall, with respect to profitability, the results of the flexible power generation scenarios are dependent upon the properties of the technical plant, such as its power generation and gas storage capacities. Relative GHG emissions from flexible biogas plants show significantly lower values than for referenced fossil gas-steam power stations. Among the various scenarios, the results reveal that the level of GHG emissions especially depends on the number of operating hours of the additional combined heat and power unit(s). The results of the analyzed biogas plants showed no direct correlation between GHG emissions and the economic benefits. Overall, a flexible power generation of biogas plants may improve the economic viability as well as result in lower GHG emissions in comparison with a conventional base load operation.

TI  - Investigation into the Viability of Replacing Internal Combustion Diesel Generators with Diesel Fired Stirling Engine Generators for Remote Microwave Radio Telecommunication Applications
AB  - Northwestel is a Canadian based telecommunication company operating over 100 "prime-power" systems supporting a microwave radio and fiber optic telecommunication network spanning Canada's North, encompassing some of the most rugged and sparsely populated geography on earth. The operation and maintenance (O&M) of the network involves significant expense due to its remoteness. Access to approx 40% of the sites for quarterly maintenance and fuel delivery is via helicopter, which is very costly. Small scale 10-15 kW diesel generators along with battery storage, is the system of choice for providing "off grid" power requirements. This arrangement has supplied the remote site energy needs for many years, while assuring an incredibly high level of reliability. Northwestel has incrementally reduced its O&M costs at remote sites by increasing system efficiencies. However, decreasing availability of new system efficiencies combined with aging infrastructure has prompted Northwestel to examine a broader range of technology options for the power and heat production. In partnership with the Cold Climate Innovation Center (CCIC), a division of the Yukon Research Center, Northwestel is investigating alternative methods for power generation. The Stirling engine is a promising and maturing technology, and is being considered for remote site energy/heat requirements. [GRAPHICS] .

TI  - Novel cycles for power generation with CO2 capture using OMCM technology
VL  - 1
SP  - 335-342
AB  - Most capture technologies, today, are associated with large energy penalties, thus decreasing their economic viability. Efficiency is one of the most important feature when designing and selecting power plants with CO2 capture. Oxygen mixed conducting membranes (OMCM) that separate oxygen from air can be used to develop oxy-combustion concepts to capture carbon dioxide with a small energy penalty. This high temperature membrane is combined with two heat exchangers (a low temperature and a high temperature one) on either end of the membrane and a combustor to form a MCM reactor that can replace the combustion chamber in a traditional gas turbine. The MCM reactor is integrated in five power cycles to provide flexibility, both in the extent of carbon capture and in different process schemes such as polygeneration. Thermodynamic evaluations for five concepts utilizing the MCM technology have been presented. The modeling results show that these concepts offer efficiencies in the range 49-55% including CO2 compression to 110 bar, and 85-100% CO2 capture. These concepts have the highest efficiencies of all previously published results for large-scale power cycles using natural gas as fuel. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

TI  - The electric energy potential of landfill biogas in Brazil
VL  - 65
SP  - 150-164
AB  - The increases in a country's energy capacity are related to its gross domestic product (GDP). In Brazil, increases in income and the consumption of goods and services have led to an increase in the generation of solid waste (SW), which is sent to landfills as a method of treatment and final disposal. The purpose of this study was to facilitate an increase in energy generation from renewable resources, specifically from landfills via thermal biogas plants, and the research was divided into two phases. The first phase involved the assessment of the potential population size contributing to the landfill, which could result in the installation of a financially viable enterprise to generate electricity in Brazil. Next, an estimate of the costs associated with the generation and collection of solid waste in Brazil was predicted by GDP prognoses, the latter being in accordance with the National Energy Balance (Balanco Energetico Nacional - BEN) plan created by the Mines and Energy Ministry of Brazil (Ministerio de Minas e Energia do Brasil - MME). The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of each enterprise scenario was used in the first stage to assess the plan's financial viability. In the second stage, estimation curves such as logistics, decreasing rate of growth, and logarithmic curves were used to establish relationships between the generation scenarios and the projected collection of SW and projected GDP. Thus, a range of possible landfill biogas/methane generation values and installed energy capacities were created, considering the extreme maximum and minimum values. These values were related to the energy sources from residual fuels reported by BEN. The results demonstrated that such values still represented a small percentage (0.00020% in 2010 and 0.44496-0.81042% in 2030) of the projected energy generation from residual fuels. Thus, an urgent need was identified to formulate policies that would encourage landfills as a source of renewable energy, broadening the number of financially viable initiatives for energy generation from landfill biogas for populations of fewer than 200,000 inhabitants.

VL  - 95
IS  - 3
SP  - 315-323
AB  - The effects of two bacterial endosymbionts, designated PASS and PAR, were evaluated on the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera:Aphididae), in which they occur facultatively, and on the blue alfalfa aphid, A. kondoi Shinji, in which these bacteria have not been found in natural populations. Subclones of pea aphids and blue alfalfa aphids, derived from parent aphid clones that did not contain PASS or PAR, were infected with one or both bacteria, generating PASS- and/or PAR-positive subclones with minimal genetic differences from the parent clones. Under laboratory conditions at 20 degrees C, PAR consistently reduced the fecundity (by between 19 and 60%) of subclones derived from three different parent pea aphid clones on bur clover, Medicago hispida Gaertn. PAR had intermediate effects on pea aphids reared on sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus L., and had no significant effect on pea aphids on alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. The effect of PASS was either neutral or negative, depending on parent clone as well as host plant. Also at 20 degrees C, PASS reduced fecundity (70-77%) and longevity (40-48%), and increased the age of first reproduction (by up to 1.5 days) of blue alfalfa aphid reared on alfalfa and clover. PAR had a less dramatic effect (e.g., 30-39% reduction in fecundity) on these traits of blue alfalfa aphid. In contrast, PAR and PASS increased the fitness of pea aphid subclones of one parent clone reared for three generations at 25 degrees C on each of the three test plants. Without facultative bacteria, fecundity of the parent clone was reduced to a mean total of < 6 offspring per adult at this elevated temperature, but with PASS or PAR, mean total fecundity of its subclones was > 35. However, this ameliorative effect of facultative bacteria at 25 degrees C was not found for two other sets of parent clones and their derived subclones. Alate production in pea aphids was significantly increased in large populations of two PASS- and PAR-positive subclones relative to their parent clones. Attempts to transmit PASS or PAR horizontally, i.e., from aphid to aphid via feeding on host plants (bur clover), were unsuccessful.

AB  - An unacceptable proportion of stallion sperm do not survive the freeze-thaw process. The hypothesis of this study was that adding cholesterol to a stallion semen extender would stabilise the sperm membrane, resulting in an improved post-thaw semen quality in terms of increased sperm viability, membrane integrity and fluidity, and reduced oxidative stress. Semen was collected from three stallions and diluted in four extenders: TALP; TALP + 0.75 mg methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-cholesterol (M beta CD)/mL (M beta CD0.75); TALP + 1.5 mg M beta CD-cholesterol/mL(M beta CD1.5); and Equipro. Following 15 min incubation, samples were centrifuged and diluted to 100 x 10(6) sperm/mL, frozen in 0.5 mL straws and stored in liquid nitrogen. Sperm from each treatment was assessed for progressive linear motility (PLM) and acceptable membrane integrity under hypotonic conditions on a phase contrast microscope at 1000x while viability, membrane fluidity and superoxide generation were assessed by flow cytometry. The M beta CD1.5 and M beta CD0.75 treatments had a greater proportion of viable sperm than the TALP treatment (P<0.01). There was no effect of treatment on PLM or membrane integrity. The M beta CD1.5 treatment had a greater proportion of viable sperm positive for membrane fluidity than the TALP treatment (P<0.05). The M beta CD1.5 and M beta CD0.75 treatments had a lesser proportion of viable sperm positive for superoxide generation than the TALP treatment (P<0.001). This study has demonstrated that adding cholesterol to stallion sperm prior to cryopreservation increases post-thaw viability, with these viable sperm being of better quality in terms of increased membrane fluidity and reduced superoxide generation.

TI  - The "Sandwich" System: A Potential Solution for Protecting Overwintering Cornu aspersum Snails Reared in Semi-Intensive Heliciculture Farms in Colder Climates

AB  - Simple Summary The Italian semi-intensive (ISISF) technology is widely used for rearing the Mediterranean snail, Cornu aspersum. It relies on protecting overwintering specimens with Lutrasil frost cloth (LFC). This approach yielded elevated mortalities in Romanian snail farms. We aimed to develop a simple and effective system for protecting overwintering C. aspersum adults in colder climates. This three-year, three-phase experiment investigated selected behavioral aspects and thermal protection efficiency of different protective structures. Mature gastropods in preparation for hibernation exhibited a significant preference for wood and ridge-tile micro shelters. Soil texture significantly influenced the burrowing behavior, but not the burrowing depth. The structure soil/LFC/straw/10-cm air cushion/high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-the "sandwich" system-was selected to be used as a protective system. Under farm conditions, adult snails tended to hibernate clustered together, attached to the lower surface of micro shelters. The "sandwich" system coupled with using ridge-tile/wood micro shelters resulted in significantly higher survival thanthe sole use of LFC. Predator occurrence appeared to exert a minor effect on snail survival. These data render the "sandwich" system a potential solution for overwintering C. aspersum breeders in colder climates. (1) Background: Hibernation in pens covered with LFC was associated with high mortality of C. aspersum snails in Romanian snail farms. This three-year study aimed to develop a simple, but effective system for protecting breeders in colder climates. (2) Methods: The first phase investigated the (pre)hibernal burrowing behavior and the overwintering habitat choice. Protective structures based on straw, LFC, and/or HDPE were tested at pilot level (no snails). The most suitable system was applied under farm conditions. (3) Results: Wood and ridge-tile micro shelters were significantly preferred to corrugated iron micro shelters. Burrowing specimens acted as shallow-burrowers, and this behaviorwas significantly more common for looser soils. All pilot systems displayed significantly higher thermal protection efficiency compared to the sole use of LFC. The balance between straw moistening and thermal protection favored using structure soil/LFC/straw/10-cm air cushion/HDPE. Its use yielded significantly higher survival compared to the sole use of LFC. Most hibernating snails clustered together in large groups, attached on the lower surface of micro shelters. Predator occurrence appeared to marginally affect overwintering survival. (4) Conclusions: The "sandwich" system could be an effective solution for overwintering mature C. aspersum snails in colder climates.
