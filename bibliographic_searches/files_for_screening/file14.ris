TI  - Depth of the Martian cryosphere: Revised estimates and implications for the existence and detection of subpermafrost groundwater
VL  - 115
AB  - The Martian cryosphere is defined as that region of the crust where the temperature remains continuously below the freezing point of water. Previous estimates of its present thickness have ranged from similar to 2.3-4.7 km at the equator to similar to 6.5-12.5 km at the poles. Here we revisit these calculations, review some of the assumptions on which they were based, and investigate the effects of several parameters, not previously considered, on the cryosphere's thermal evolution and extent. These include astronomically driven climate change, the temperature-dependent thermal properties of an ice-rich crust, the potential presence of gas hydrate and perchlorate-saturated groundwater, and consideration of recent lower estimates of present-day global heat flow (which suggest a mean value roughly half that previously thought, effectively doubling the potential thickness of frozen ground). The implications of these findings for the continued survival of subpermafrost groundwater and its potential detection by the MARSIS radar sounder onboard Mars Express are then discussed. Although our estimates of the maximum potential thickness of the cryosphere have significantly increased, consideration of the likely range and spatial variability of crustal heat flow and thermal properties, in combination with the potential presence of potent freezing point depressing salts, may result in substantial local variations in cryosphere thickness. The locations that appear best suited for the detection of groundwater are those that combine low latitude (minimizing the thickness of frozen ground) and low elevation (minimizing the depth to a water table in hydrostatic equilibrium). Preliminary results from a MARSIS investigation of one such area are discussed.

TI  - Effect of selection for fasting tolerance on feed intake, growth and feed efficiency in the European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax
VL  - 420
SP  - S42-S49
AB  - Feed efficiency is a major goal for aquaculture sustainability, and selecting fish to genetically enhance this trait would be highly valuable. However, no selective breeding program specifically targeted to feed efficiency exists for farmed fish, mostly because of the difficulty of measuring individual feed intake. However, a negative phenotypic correlation between feed efficiency and weight loss at fasting has been previously demonstrated in sea bass submitted to feed deprivation (FD). We mated sea bass parents selected for their high (FD+) or low (FD-) weight loss at fasting to produce FD+ and FD- progeny, which were reared in a single tank to avoid common environmental effects. At 8 months of age, 1200 of those fish were submitted to three alternating periods of fasting (3 weeks) and re-feeding (3 weeks). Individuals were weighed at the end of each feeding and fasting period. Their line of origin was identified by genotyping of 12 microsatellite markers, resulting in 1130 unambiguously assigned fish (484 FD-, 686 FD+). FD- offspring lost significantly less weight than FD+ offspring in this feed deprivation trial. After that the feed efficiency of eight groups of 50 FD+ fish and eight groups of 50 FD- fish was evaluated in four successive 20-day periods. At the end of the fourth period, 10 fish per tank were sacrificed to evaluate their carcass yield. The FD- fish had a better overall growth and were fatter, and FD+ fish had a better carcass yield. A better feed efficiency was expected for the FD- fish, but differences between the two groups for this trait, measured either with feed efficiency ratio or with residual feed intake, were not consistently significant Although the two lines were clearly divergent for several traits, demonstration of feed efficiency differences between the FD+ and the FD- lines was not consistently observed in sea bass. A second generation of selection may allow further divergence in the lines and reveal differences in feed efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Separation of CO2 from flue gas using electrochemical cells
VL  - 89
IS  - 6
SP  - 1307-1314
AB  - Past research with high temperature molten carbonate electrochemical cells has shown that carbon dioxide can be separated from flue gas streams produced by pulverized coal combustion for power generation. However, the presence of trace contaminants, i.e., sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides, will impact the electrolyte within the cell. If a lower temperature cell could be devised that would utilize the benefits of commercially-available, upstream desulfurization and denitrification in the power plant, then this CO2 separation technique can approach more viability in the carbon sequestration area. Recent work has led to the assembly and successful operation of a low temperature electrochemical cell. In the proof-of-concept testing with this cell, an anion exchange membrane was sandwiched between gas-diffusion electrodes consisting of nickel-based anode electrocatalysts on carbon paper. When a potential was applied across the cell and a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide was flowed over the wetted electrolyte on the cathode side, a stream of CO2 to O-2 was produced on the anode side, suggesting that carbonate/bicarbonate ions are the CO2 carrier in the membrane. Since a mixture of CO2 and O-2 is produced, the possibility exists to use this stream in oxy-firing of additional fuel. From this research, a novel concept for efficiently producing a carbon dioxide rich effluent from combustion of a fossil fuel was proposed. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are captured from the flue gas of a fossil-fuel combustor by one or more electrochemical cells or cell stacks. The separated stream is then transferred to an oxy-fired combustor which uses the gas stream for ancillary combustion, ultimately resulting in an effluent rich in carbon dioxide. A portion of the resulting flow produced by the oxy-fired combustor may be continuously recycled back into the oxy-fired combustor for temperature control and an optimal carbon dioxide rich effluent.

VL  - 106
SP  - 23291-23316
AB  - The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was placed into Mars orbit on September 11, 1997, and by March 9, 1999, had slowly circularized through aerobraking to a Sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with an average altitude of 378 km. The science payload includes the Mars Orbiter Camera, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, Thermal Emission Spectrometer, Ultrastable Oscillator (for Radio Science experiments), and Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer package. In addition, the spacecraft accelerometers and horizon sensors were used to study atmospheric dynamics during aerobraking. Observations are processed to standard products by the instrument teams and released as documented archive volumes on 6-month centers by the Planetary Data System. Significant results have been obtained from observations of the interior, surface, and atmosphere. For example, Mars does not now have an active magnetic field, although strong remanent magnetization features exist in the ancient crust. These results imply that an internal dynamo ceased operation early in geologic time. Altimetry and gravity data indicate that the crust is thickest under the south pole, thinning northward from the cratered terrain to the northern plains. Analysis of altimetry data demonstrates that Mars is "egg-shaped" with gravitational equipotential contours that show that channel systems in the southern highlands drained to the north, largely to the Chryse trough. A closed contour in the northern plains is consistent with the existence of a great northern ocean. Emission spectra of low-albedo regions show that basaltic rocks dominate spectral signatures on the southern highlands, whereas basaltic andesites dominate the northern lowlands. The bright regions show nondiagnostic spectra, similar to that of dust in the atmosphere. Signatures of aqueous minerals (e.g., clays, carbonates, and sulfates) are noticeably absent from the emission spectra. High spatial resolution images show that the surface has been extensively modified by wind and that layering is nearly ubiquitous, implying that a complex history of events is recorded in surface and near-surface materials. Altimetry data imply that both permanent caps are composed of water ice and dust, with seasonal covers of carbon dioxide frost. Finally, the altimetry data, coupled with thousands of atmospheric profiles, are providing new boundary conditions and dynamic controls for the generation and testing of more realistic dynamic models of the global circulation of the atmosphere.

TI  - Prolonged environmental stress induces mutations and provides nonspecific adaptation of drosophila populations
VL  - 9
SP  - 301-+
AB  - Adaptation of natural drosophila populations from the area radiocontaminated due to the Chernobyl accident (Vetka district of Gomel region) and from the control area (Berezinsky National Reserve) to irradiation was studied. Additional exposure to 40 Gy gamma-rays resulted in different responses of population samples - much more dominant and recessive lethal mutations arose in the population from the control area than from that with "radiation history". Viability of flies from Vetka district was much higher after additional irradiation in comparison with flies from Berezinsky Reserve. These facts prove that Vetka population is more resistant to radiation than Berezinsky one. When the population samples were kept under laboratory conditions without irradiation for 8 generations it was revealed that the mutation level in both populations increased at keeping under such conditions. Adaptation of Vetka population to irradiation remained, besides, the control population also became more resistant to ionizing radiation. It means that keeping of natural drosophila populations under laboratory conditions is a strong stress (limited space, overpopulation, other temperature and light conditions), which increases a mutation process and induces non-specific adaptation. In order to study the process of insect adaptation in detail we investigated experimental drosophila populations of 4 kinds: control, supplied with melanin, irradiated in each generation and irradiated with melanin. The samples of these populations were exposed to 30 Gy x-rays in the 55(th) generation. Dominant and recessive lethal mutation frequencies, induced by additional radiation exposure, were the lowest in the irradiated population - this population was best adapted to ionizing radiation impact. The population irradiated with melanin was less resistant. This may be explained by a radioprotective action of melanin - more radiosensitive genotypes were not eliminated by natural selection and remained in the population preventing its adaptation. Thus melanin which is an effective radioprotector against chronic irradiation is able to prevent adaptation process.

VL  - 63

SP  - 645-652
AB  - To date, very few studies have assessed the impact of summer droughts on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Decreased ecosystem productivity and increased mortality are general consequences of drought on biodiversity. Competitive species, species adapted to cold and wet conditions as well as species with low reproduction rates and/or limited mobility seem the more affected. However, species-specific effects are regulated by mechanisms allowing for resistance to drought. The short-term consequences of drought on biodiversity depend on species abilities to resist, and to recover after, drought, and on competitive interactions between species. Although the abundance of many species generally decreases during drought, some taxa may increase in number during drought or shortly after. The effects of recurrent droughts must be evaluated in the wider context of global climate and habitat change. Considering the predicted increase in drought frequency and intensity, interdisciplinary research initiatives on this issue are needed urgently.

TI  - Carbon Inputs from Miscanthus Displace Older Soil Organic Carbon Without Inducing Priming
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 86-101
AB  - The carbon (C) dynamics of a bioenergy system are key to correctly defining its viability as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuel energy sources. Recent studies have quantified the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of these bioenergy crops, often concluding that C sequestration in soils plays a primary role in offsetting emissions through energy generation. Miscanthus is a particularly promising bioenergy crop and research has shown that soil C stocks can increase by more than 2 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In this study, we use a stable isotope (C-13) technique to trace the inputs and outputs from soils below a commercial Miscanthus plantation in Lincolnshire, UK, over the first 7 years of growth after conversion from a conventional arable crop. Results suggest that an unchanging total topsoil (0-30 cm) C stock is caused by Miscanthus additions displacing older soil organic matter. Further, using a comparison between bare soil plots (no new Miscanthus inputs) and undisturbed Miscanthus controls, soil respiration was seen to be unaffected through priming by fresh inputs or rhizosphere. The temperature sensitivity of old soil C was also seen to be very similar with and without the presence of live root biomass. Total soil respiration from control plots was dominated by Miscanthus-derived emissions with autotrophic respiration alone accounting for similar to 50 % of CO2. Although total soil C stocks did not change significantly over time, the Miscanthus-derived soil C accumulated at a rate of 860 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) over the top 30 cm. Ultimately, the results from this study indicate that soil C stocks below Miscanthus plantations do not necessarily increase during the first 7 years.

TI  - Resorcinol-based carbon xerogel/ZnO composite for solar-light-induced photodegradation of sulfamerazine
VL  - 128
AB  - Recently, the release of antibiotics, such as sulfonamides, into the environment has raised significant concern due to the potential creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Thus, the development of remediation technologies for effluents containing such compounds is of utmost urgency. In this context, this work evaluated the creation of a resorcinol-based carbon xerogel/zinc oxide photocatalyst (XC/ZnO) to efficiently promote the photodegradation of the antibiotic known as sulfamerazine in aqueous media. The employment of this carbonaceous structure as a co-catalyst is justified by its high surface area and electrical conductivity. The methodology used in the synthesis of the composites was a simple one-pot reaction, combining the simultaneous precipitation of zinc oxide and polycondensation of the resorcinol-based carbon gel. Regarding the composites' characterization, X-ray diffractometry confirms that the composites have the Wurtzite structure of the zinc oxide, whereas the carbon xerogel formation is evidenced by the infrared, diffuse reflectance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Morphology-wise, the XC/ZnO is arranged as nodular particle agglomerates, with particles between 500 nm and 50 nm. The photocatalytic tests under simulated solar radiation show that the composites developed are superior to the pure oxide in the photodegradation of sulfamerazine, as all XC/ZnO materials developed achieved higher apparent reaction rate constants (kapp) than pure zinc oxide, with the XC/ZnO 0.5 material obtaining a kapp 75% higher than the one observed for the ZnO sample. Furthermore, the chronoamperometry tests confirmed that the optimized composite (XC/ZnO 0.5) has a greater capacity for photocurrent generation when compared to pure zinc oxide. Therefore, the modification proposed was successful to enhance the photodegradation of sulfamerazine in aqueous media, highlighting the viability of the composites developed for photocatalytic applications.

TI  - Environmental benefits of large-scale second-generation bioethanol production in the EU : An integrated supply chain network optimization and life cycle assessment approach
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 677-692
AB  - The use of agricultural residues for the generation of bioethanol has the potential to substitute fuels such as petrol or first-generation bioethanol and thereby generate environmental benefits. Scientific research in this field typically confines the environmental dimension to global warming, disregarding other environmental impact and damage categories. By multi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming, this work examines environmental benefits and economic viability of optimal second-generation bioethanol production network configurations to substitute petrol and/or first-generation bioethanol in the EU. The results comprise environmentally optimal decisions for 18 impact and 3 damage categories, as well as economically optimal solutions for different excise and carbon tax scenarios. The impact categories global warming potential, particulate matter, and land use are affected the most. Optimal network decisions for different environmental objectives can be clustered into three groups of mutual congruencies, but opportunity costs between the different groups can be very high, indicating conflicting decisions. The decision to substitute petrol or first-generation ethanol has the greatest influence. The results of the multi-dimensional analysis suggest that the damage categories human health and ecosystem quality are suitable to unveil tradeoffs between conflicting environmental impacts, for example, global warming and land use. Taking human health and ecosystem quality as environmental decision criteria, second-generation bioethanol should be used to concurrently substitute first-generation bioethanol and petrol (100% and 18% of today's demand in the EU, respectively). However, economic optimization shows that with current taxation, bioethanol is hardly competitive with petrol, and that excise tax abatement or carbon taxes are needed to achieve these volumes.

TI  - Direct coupling of an electrolyser to a solar PV system for generating hydrogen
VL  - 34
IS  - 6
SP  - 2531-2542
AB  - Hydrogen as an energy currency, carrier and storage medium may be a key component of the solution to problems of global warming, poor air quality and dwindling reserves of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is particularly advantageous if an electrolyser may be simply and efficiently coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines direct coupling of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to a matched solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation and storage. Such direct coupling with minimum interfacing electronics would lead to substantial cost reduction and thereby enhance the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems. The electrolyser is designed for fail-safe operation with multiple levels of safety and operational redundancy. A control system in the electrolyser unit provides for disconnection when required and for auto-start in the morning and auto shut-down at night, simultaneously addressing the goals of minimum energy loss and maximum safety. The PV system is a 2.4 kW array (20.4 m(2) total area) comprising 30, 12 V, 80 W, Solarex polycrystalline modules in a series-parallel configuration. The integrated system has been operated for approximately 60 days over a 4-month period from September 2007 to January 2008 with many periods of unattended operation for multiple days, experiencing weather ranging from hot and sunny (above 40 degrees C) to cool and cloudy. The principle and practicality of direct coupling of a suitably matched PV array and PEM electrolyser have been successfully demonstrated. Details of electrolyser operation coupled to a PV array along with modelling work to match current-voltage characteristics of the electrolyser and PV system are described.

VL  - 203
SP  - 1119-1131
AB  - This study explored the potential of carbon emission reduction and financial feasibility of urban rooftop photovoltaic (PV) power applications with a case study in Beijing. Life cycle CO2 emission factors of thermal power and rooftop PV power generation were calculated and compared. Rooftop area suitable for installation of PV in the urban region of Beijing was estimated. Three use patterns were proposed and the potential of CO2 emission reduction of PV for each pattern were estimated. Financial feasibility analysis was conducted for different PV power subsidization and environmental externality internalization scenarios, and sensitivity analysis was applied to test the impacts of initial investment, carbon price, air pollutant tax rates and PV power generation subsidy variation. The life cycle CO2 emission factor of rooftop PV power in Beijing is estimated to be 87.01 g CO2-eq./kWh, and the CO2 emission reduction factor in Beijing of rooftop PV power substitution for coal-fired thermal power generation amounts to 919.34 g CO2-eq./kWh. The potential of rooftop PV power generation in Beijing varies from 3298.48 to 6734.32 M kWh/y, with the annual CO2 emission reduction estimated to be 3.03-6.19 Mt. Initial investment is among the main barriers for rooftop PV to become financially feasible. Govern [rental subsidies to initial investment and PV power generation are necessary for their significant role in improving financial viability of urban rooftop PV application. However, ongoing subsidies might have been too high. Even when such subsidies are reduced by 50-70%, the PV applications are still financially feasible. Environmental tax and carbon trading are also recommended to internalize environmental benefit of PV application. It is estimated that when carbon price is 4-8 times higher than the current price level for the three patterns can the projects pass the financial feasibility test. To reach the same goal, SO2 and NOx tax rates should also be much higher than their current level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hydromechanical processes during in situ coal gasification
VL  - 2004
SP  - 123-132
AB  - situ coal gasification is a method of extracting a high proportion of the energy value from coal without the need for mining. In situ conversion of coal to combustible gases is achieved by drilling wells into the seam, injecting gasification agents and initiating combustion. The product gases are then extracted to surface using production wells. These gases are clean energy sources for power generation, heating or synthetic fuel production. In situ coal gasification is of particular interest with respect to its lower environmental impact, potential application to otherwise inaccessible energy resources (ie offshore, deep deposits or beneath protected lands) and low capital intensity. Practical application of this clean technology is restricted primarily by lack of satisfactory quantitative descriptions of the processes involved, in particular the hydromechanical processes. In this study, three characteristic physical zones of an in situ gasifier are identified as the rubble zone, combustion front and virgin coal zone. Coupled mechanical processes of coal consumption and overburden collapse are used to describe the permeability profile in the rubble zone. Additionally, the redistribution of overburden load associated with coal consumption is accounted for with the formulation of a stress (compressive) dependent permeability profile, which is applied to the virgin coal zone. The model was implemented into and solved by FEMLAB, an advanced computer simulation tool. The flow process, according to Darcy's Law, is subsequently described in terms of permeability dependent injectivity. Injectivity is an indicator of flow velocity, which has been identified as a crucial factor in determining the commercial value of product gases from in situ coal gasification. The stress alteration to coal permeability was found to have a dominating influence on the flow process. This finding implies that a greater understanding of the in situ coal burning induced deformation of surrounding rocks would be of significant value in assessing the economic viability of applying this clean technology to potential sites.

TI  - Economic feasibility of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems considering electricity standby tariffs
VL  - 169
SP  - 420-432
AB  - This study examines economic viability of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems when applied to the Department of Energy (DOE) reference large office building in three locales in the U.S.: San Francisco, Boston, and Miami. For realistic power generation unit (PGU) sizes, annual, monthly, and hourly operation costs are estimated using local utility tariffs and compared to those of conventional separate heat and power systems. The results show that compared to conventional systems, CCHP systems reduce operation cost by 0.11-0.42 million $/y in San Francisco and Boston, whereas they increase the cost by 0.16-0.29 million $/y in Miami. The cost savings are mainly attributed to electricity savings; therefore, be maintained unless electricity costs drastically decrease. Considerable cost savings are attributed to both energy and demand charges if tariff structures estimate demand charges as much as energy charges (e.g., San Francisco). Under time-of-use rates, the largest cost saving occurs during peak periods because of high utilization of PGUs that significantly reduces energy and demand charges. Although a larger PGU capacity yields a greater cost saving, an over-sized PGU decrease profitability. The results suggest that for regions with relatively expensive natural gas and low electricity cost, CCHP systems would not be profitable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of conservation genomics will be greatly aided by the use of neutral as well as adaptive molecular markers. Identifying novel adaptive molecular markers that have general application across diverse taxa is challenging, especially in Arthropods where few if any examples of balanced polymorphisms exist that are shared across species. A review of literature on the Pgi gene provides strong evidence for population level fitness consequences of genetic variation in this gene, across very diverse lineages of Arthropods. While these observations demonstrate the potential of using Pgi as an adaptive molecular marker, this gene is fundamentally different from the adaptive markers MHC and SI. Rather than providing insights into individual genetic health, Pgi appears to have a role in conservation genetics by providing insights into gene by environment interactions, local adaptation and evolutionary significant units, and potentially even morphologically cryptic dispersal phenotypes. These findings argue for studying Pgi variation in more species, as it appears central to the goals of conservation genomics.

TI  - Techno-economic performance analysis of energy production from biomass at different scales in the UK context
VL  - 171
IS  - 3
SP  - 986-996
AB  - This paper compares the results of a techno-economic performance analysis of three combustion plants for the recovery of energy from three types of biomass: solid recovered fuel (SRF), forestry waste wood chips (FWWC), and crude rape seed oil (RSO). Small and medium scale plants have been investigated, 50 kilo tonnes per annum (ktpa) and 160 ktpa combustion plants utilising FWWC, 50 ktpa and 100 ktpa plants treating SRF, and an internal combustion engine plant at 27 ktpa and 40 ktpa utilising RSO. The technical assessment includes calculations for electricity generation, heat produced and overall system efficiency. The economic viability of the different processes is investigated through a discounted cash flow analysis. The levelised cost is used to calculate the cost of production of one unit of electricity. The effect of changing model input parameters on the economic performance is evaluated. Seven different system variables have been chosen and the effect of a +/- 10% change on the levelised cost has been examined. The results showed that the levelised cost of the SRF plant is mainly affected by calorific value, turbine efficiency, capital and operating costs. The parameters which affect the FWWC biomass plant are the calorific value, steam turbine efficiency, capital and operating costs. Whereas, parameters affecting the RSO biomass plant are the calorific value, engine efficiency, capital and operating costs. A techno-economic analysis of the plants indicates the SRF plant is economical at both scales. The RSO plant and the FWWC plant are only economical at the medium scales investigated. The 40 ktpa RSO plant is found to be the most efficient one at 52% compared with 28% efficiency for the SRF plant, it is also the most economically viable option with a 25% IRR compared to 17% IRR for the FWWC plant, and 10% IRR for the SRF plant.

TI  - Energy efficiency contributions and losses during selective laser melting
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) technique requires remelting of adjacent tracks to avoid cavities and other imperfections. Usually, very conservative process parameters are chosen to avoid imperfections, resulting in a low building rate. The process efficiency relates the energy required for the generation of a new track to the laser beam power. For SLM, this efficiency is determined by the process parameters, specifically hatch distance, layer depth, and scanning speed, independent of the resulting process mechanisms. For SLM, the process efficiency is often very low, typically 2%-20%. Apart from beam reflection losses of normally 50%-60%, significant energy losses result from the remelting of surrounding layers. Some areas can even experience multiple remelting cycles. Further losses originate inevitably from substrate heating. A simplified mathematical model of the track cross section and the corresponding layer overlap geometry has been developed to analyze the different loss contributions from remelting with respect to the process parameters. The model explains why increasing the hatch distance or the layer depth proportionally increases the process efficiency. However, these increases are limited by cavity formation. The cross section of the overlapping tracks generated by SLM can be regarded as an experimental fingerprint linked to the process conditions. The track cross section geometries can significantly fluctuate in terms of area and coordinate position. The fluctuations require additional reduction of the hatch distance or layer depth to ensure robust, cavity-free processing. Examples are presented for stainless steel where a 180 W laser beam has led to a process efficiency of 5%-11%, proportional to a hatch distance that was increased from 50 to 110 mu m, for 40 mu m powder layer depth, at a speed of 50 m/min.

TI  - Comparative transcriptomic analysis brings new insights into the response to acute temperature acclimation in burbot (Lota lota lota)
VL  - 20
AB  - Temperature is a crucial environmental factor affecting the survival and growth of aquatic organisms. However, the global warming caused by the growth of greenhouse gas emission has severely affected the sustainable development of global nature ecosystem. The change in water temperature has caused a disorder in the aquatic ecosystems. Lota lota lota is a unique member of cold-freshwater codfish; it has an important economic value like its marine relatives. It is also a good model for studying the molecular mechanisms of temperature adaptability of fish. In this study, RNA sequencing based on the Illumina HiSeq(TM) 2500 platform was used to reveal gene expression at the transcriptome level. Transcriptome profiles were generated from liver and brain samples from fish exposed to (0 degrees C, 17 degrees C and 28 degrees C). A total of 30,958 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in all comparisons, with more DEGs in high-temperature groups (1668) than in low-temperature groups (1110). GO analysis was divided into three extensive categories and 55 subcategories. A series of candidate genes and pathways associated with temperature responsiveness was detected, mainly including heatshock protein (HSP) family, fatty acid desaturase (FAD) and antigen processing and presentation. The expression levels of HSP70 were highest amongst those of the HSP family members in the high-temperature groups, implying that HSP70 was an efficient biomarker of high temperature challenge in L. lota lota. An obvious upward trend in the expression of FAD was conducive to regulating fatty acid composition and maintaining membrane fluidity under low-temperature stress. In addition, evidence indicated that elevated temperature had a large influence on immune function and heat stress could upregulate the immune-related pathways in L. lota lota.

TI  - Transcriptomic responses to extreme low salinity among locally adapted populations of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida)
VL  - 27
IS  - 21
SP  - 4225-4240
AB  - The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) is a foundation species inhabiting estuaries along the North American west coast. In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events.

TI  - Enhanced cathode performance of a rGO-V2O5 nanocomposite catalyst for microbial fuel cell applications
VL  - 47
IS  - 46
SP  - 16777-16788
AB  - A reduced graphene oxide-V2O5 nanocomposite was synthesized by a low temperature surfactant free hydrothermal method and its MFC performance was assessed. The structural properties of the synthesized nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction. Field emission scanning electron microscopy of the nanocomposite revealed a wrinkled paper-like structure of rGO and a nanobelt-like structure of V2O5. This study estimated the viability of the graphene-based nanocomposite rGO-V2O5 as a novel cathode catalyst in single chamber air-cathode MFCs. A series of MFCs with different catalyst loadings were produced. The electrochemical behavior of the MFCs was calculated by cyclic voltammetry. The MFCs with the rGO-V2O5 nanocomposite cathode exhibited superior maximum power densities (83%) to those with the pure V2O5 cathodes. The rGO-V2O5 with a double-loaded nanocomposite catalyst achieved an enhanced power density of 1668 +/- 11 mW m(-2) and an OCP of 698 +/- 4 mV, which was 83% of that estimated for the Pt/C 2004 +/- 15 mW m(-2) nanocomposite cathode. The significant increase in power density suggests that the reduced graphene oxide-V2O5 nanocomposite is a promising material for MFC applications. The CV result showed good agreement with the MFC result. The prepared rGO-V2O5 nanocomposite cathode, particularly with a double loading catalyst, is promising as a sustainable low-cost green material for stable power generation and long-term operation of MFCs.

TI  - Molecular modelling of quinoline derivatives as telomerase inhibitors through 3D-QSAR, molecular dynamics simulation, and molecular docking techniques
VL  - 27
IS  - 2
AB  - Rising mortality due to cancer has led to the development and identification of newer targets and molecules to cure the disease. Telomerase is one of the attractive targets for design of many chemotherapeutic drugs. This research highlights the designing of novel telomerase inhibitors using ligand-based (3D-QSAR) and structure-based (molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation) approaches. For the development of the 3D-QSAR model, 37 synthetic molecules reported earlier as telomerase inhibitors were selected from diversified literature. Three different alignment methods were explored; among them, distill alignment was found to be the best method with good statistical results and was used for the generation of QSAR model. Statistically significant CoMSIA model with a correlation coefficient (r(ncv)(2)) value of 0.974, leave one out (q(2)) value of 0.662 and predicted correlation coefficient (r(pred)(2)) value of 0.560 was used for the analysis of QSAR. For the MDS study, A-chain of telomerase was stabilised for 50 ns with respect to 1-atm pressure, with an average temperature of 299.98 k and with potential energy of 1,145,336 kJ/m converged in 997 steps. Furthermore, the behaviour study of variants towards the target revealed that active variable gave better affinity without affecting amino acid sequences and dimensions of protein which was accomplished through RMSD, RMSF and Rg analysis. Results of molecular docking study supported the outcomes of QSAR contour maps as ligand showed similar interactions with surrounded amino acids which were identified in contour map analysis. The results of the comprehensive study might be proved valuable for the development of potent telomerase inhibitors.

TI  - Temperature-Dependent Fecundity and Life Table of the Fennel Aphid Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
AB  - Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a cosmopolitan species and the main pest of fennel in northeastern Brazil. Understanding the relationship between temperature variations and the population growth rates of H. foeniculi is essential to predict the population dynamics of this aphid in the fennel crop. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of constant temperature on the adult prereproductive period and the life table fertility parameters (infinitesimal increase ratio (r(m)), gross reproduction rate (GRR), net reproduction rate (R-0), finite increase ratio (lambda), generation time (GT), the time required for the population to double in the number of individuals (DT), and the reproduction value (RVx)) of the fennel pest H. foeniculi. The values of lx (survival of nymphs at age x) increased as the temperature rose from 15 to 28 degrees C and fell at 30 degrees C, whereas mx (number of nymphs produced by each nymph of age x) increased from 15 to 25 degrees C and fell at 28 and 30 degrees C. The net reproduction rates (R-0) of populations of H. foeniculi increased with temperature and ranged from 1.9 at 15 degrees C to 12.23 at 28 degrees C for each generation. The highest population increase occurred with the apterous aphids at 28 degrees C. The rate of population increase per unit time (r(m)) (day) ranged from 0.0033 (15 degrees C) to 0.1995 (28 degrees C). The highest values of r(m) were recorded at temperatures of 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The rm values were a good fit to the models tested, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The models tested (Davidson, Sharpe and DeMichele modified by Schoolfield et al., Logan et al., Lamb, and Briere et al.) were very good fits for the rm values observed, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The only exception was the Davidson model. Of the parameters studied, the reproductive capacity was higher in the apterous aphids, with the unique exception of daily fecundity at 28 degrees C, which was higher in the alate aphids of H. foeniculi. Parameters relating to the age-specific fertility table for H. foeniculi were heavily influenced by temperature, with the highest biotic potential and population growth capacity found at 34 degrees C. Therefore, the results obtained in this study could be of practical significance for predicting outbreaks of fennel aphids and improving the management of this aphid in fennel crops.

TI  - Bleaching causes loss of disease resistance within the threatened coral species Acropora cervicornis
VL  - 7
AB  - Determining the adaptive potential of foundation species, such as reef-building corals, is urgent as the oceans warm and coral populations decline. Theory predicts that corals may adapt to climate change via selection on standing genetic variation. Yet, corals face not only rising temperatures but also novel diseases. We studied the interaction between two major stressors affecting colonies of the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis: white-band disease and high water temperature. We determined that 27% of A. cervicornis were disease resistant prior to a thermal anomaly. However, disease resistance was largely lost during a bleaching event because of more compromised coral hosts or increased pathogenic dose/virulence. There was no tradeoff between disease resistance and temperature tolerance; disease susceptibility was independent of Symbiodinium strain. The present study shows that susceptibility to temperature stress creates an increased risk in disease-associated mortality, and only rare genets may maintain or gain infectious disease resistance under high temperature. We conclude that A. cervicornis populations in the lower Florida Keys harbor few existing genotypes that are resistant to both warming and disease.

TI  - Aspergillus niger production of pectinase and alpha-galactosidase for enzymatic soy processing
VL  - 134
AB  - Soybean is a most promising sustainable protein source for feed and food to help meet the protein demand of the rapidly rising global population. To enrich soy protein, the environment-friendly enzymatic processing requires multiple carbohydrases including cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, alpha-galactosidase and sucrase. Besides enriched protein, the processing adds value by generating monosaccharides that are ready feedstock for biofuel/bioproducts. Aspergillus could produce the required carbohydrases, but with deficient pectinase and alpha-galactosidase. Here we address this critical technological gap by focused evaluation of the suboptimal productivity of pectinase and alpha-galactosidase. A carbohydrases-productive strain A. niger (NRRL 322) was used with soybean hull as inducing substrate. Temperatures at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C were found to affect cell growth on sucrose with an Arrhenius-law activation energy of 28.7 kcal/mol. The 30 degrees C promoted the fastest cell growth (doubling time = 2.1 h) and earliest enzyme production, but it gave lower final enzyme yield due to earlier carbon-source exhaustion. The 25 degrees C gave the highest enzyme yield. pH conditions also strongly affected enzyme production. Fermentations made with initial pH of 6 or 7 were most productive, e.g., giving 1.9- to 2.3-fold higher pectinase and 2.2- to 2.3-fold higher alpha-galactosidase after 72 h, compared to the fermentation with a constant pH 4. Further, pH must be kept above 2.6 to avoid limitation in pectinase production and, in the later substrate-limiting stage, kept below 5.5 to avoid pectinase degradation. alpha-Galactosidase production always followed the pectinase production with a 16-24 h lag; presumably, the former relied on pectin hydrolysis for inducers generation. Optimal enzyme production requires controlling the transient availability of inducers.

TI  - The benefits of ethanol use for hydrogen production in urban transportation
VL  - 13
IS  - 9
SP  - 2525-2534
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the benefits of sugar cane ethanol in Brazil, appointing the productivity of this type of fuel based on hectares of plantation, its carbon dioxide cycle and the contribution to reduce the greenhouse effect. In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen. Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratingueta, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses. As conclusion, this paper shows the economical analysis comparing buses moved by fuel cells using hydrogen by different kinds of production.

TI  - Exploring optimal strategies for aquatic macrophyte pre-treatment: Sustainable feedstock for biohydrogen production
VL  - 140
AB  - Aquatic macrophytes; Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and Azolla, biomass have certain advantages over terrestrial plant biomass to use as non-edible feed for 2nd generation bioenergy production. This is mainly due to the lower lignin content and higher productivity of aquatic macrophytes. These macrophytes do not require arable land. Present study explored on development of factorial approach based optimal pretreatment process for mild acid hydrolysis of Eichhornia crassipes and Azolla microphylla biomass for conversion to fermentable sugars. The simpler structure of aquatic plants translates to higher sugar recovery using milder pretreatment conditions compared to terrestrial plants. H2SO4 & HCl used in mild concentrations for acid hydrolysis experiments. Approximately, 20% of the dry biomass was recovered as fermentable sugar (mainly xylose) upon treatment with dilute sulphuric acid (0.5-1.5% v/v) or hydrochloric acid (2-4% v/v) at 100-120 degrees C for 30-60 min. Within this range of parameters, sugar yield followed a simple additive model, implying that a decrease in sugar yield is due to reduction of one parameter. This provides a choice between high temperature short time (HTST) and low temperature long time (LTLT) treatments. HTST requires sophisticated pressure vessels and correspondingly higher capital investment for the advantage of a higher throughput. LTLT treatments can be performed in cost economy manner using relatively simple equipment. For economic, environmental and technical reasons, acid addition should be kept to a minimum, which is possible by a choice of higher temperature and longer treatment time. Such pretreatment may be employed as the first step of a two-step pretreatment process prior to enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic fraction. The acid pre-treated hydrolysate of water hyacinth and Azolla microphylla explored for hydrogen production through dark fermentation process through employment of C-5 & C-6 sugar utilizing microbe Enterobacter cloacae DT-1 strain.

VL  - 96
SP  - 296-305
AB  - Growing concerns over the environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, uncertainty of future fossil fuel prices, geopolitical instability, and consumer preferences are a few factors driving the development and use of biomass as a source of renewable energy. Government mandates and policy frameworks have further built consensus for effective utilization of sustainable resources for energy. As a result, biomass derived densified solid biofuels have experienced a phenomenal growth in the last decade and are expected to grow by 56% during the three decades from 2010 to 2040. Solid biomass represents the largest share of biomass used for heat and electricity generation. Biomass sources range from agricultural, municipal, and commercial wastes, to forest-litter, and energy crops. Because of the varied nature of these sources, harvesting practices and the cost of transportation, several methods have been developed to densify the biomass. The long-term viability and growth of biobased energy products hinges on the technical innovation and wider societal acceptance of these products. This paper reviews multiple biomass feedstock, processing characteristics, product properties, transportation, and storage options. The paper also discusses the economics of densifying biomass, the impacts to regions where biomass utilization is implemented, outstanding challenges, and national and global trends in biomass utilization.

TI  - Improving the Degree-Day Model for Forecasting Locusta migratoria manilensis (Meyen) (Orthoptera: Acridoidea)
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - The degree-day (DD) model is an important tool for forecasting pest phenology and voltinism. Unfortunately, the DD model is inaccurate, as is the case for the Oriental migratory locust. To improve the existing DD model for this pest, we first studied locust development in seven growth chambers, each of which simulated the complete growing-season climate of a specific region in China (Baiquan, Chengde, Tumotezuoqi, Wenan, Rongan, Qiongzhong, or Qiongshan). In these seven treatments, locusts completed 0.95, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 2.95, 3.95, and 4.95 generations, respectively. Hence, in the Baiquan (700), Rongan (2400), Qiongzhong (3200), and Qiongshan (2400) treatments, the final generation were unable to lay eggs. In a second experiment, we reared locusts for a full generation in growth chambers, at different constant temperatures. This experiment provided two important findings. First, temperatures between 32 and 42 degrees C did not influence locust development rate. Hence, the additional heat provided by temperatures above 32 degrees C did not add to the total heat units acquired by the insects, according to the traditional DD model. Instead, temperatures above 32 degrees C represent overflow heat, and can not be included when calculating total heat acquired during development. We also noted that females raised at constant 21 degrees C failed to oviposit. Hence, temperatures lower than 21 degrees C should be deducted when calculating total heat acquired during adult development. Using our experimental findings, we next micmiked 24-h temperature curve and constructed a new DD model based on a 24-h temperature integral calculation. We then compared our new model with the traditional DD model, results showed the DD deviation was 166 heat units in Langfang during 2011. At last we recalculated the heat by our new DD model, which better predicted the results from our first growth chamber experiment.

TI  - Calculating melting temperatures and pressures of peridotite protoliths: Implications for the origin of cratonic mantle
VL  - 403
SP  - 273-286
AB  - The old, stable cores of continents - cratons - are underlain by thick and cold mantle keels, composed of melt-depleted and low density peridotite residues. The origins of these thick keels are debated. Were these thick keels formed in situ, by orogenic thickening, or by underplating of buoyant residual mantle? Key to this debate is determining the temperature and pressure at which the protoliths of cratonic peridotites melted (igneous protolith conditions) and comparing to their metamorphic (subsolidus) temperatures and pressures within the keel. This paper presents a method for explicit calculation of the temperatures and pressures at which the peridotite protoliths melted. The approach relies only on the bulk FeO and MgO of residual peridotites. A system of equations consisting of mass balance and new calibrations of Mg peridotite/melt partitioning and melt productivity is then solved simultaneously. The igneous protoliths of abyssal peridotites are found to have melted at effective pressures of 1-2 GPa and temperatures of 1300-1400 degrees C, within error of the magmatic temperatures and pressures of melt extraction inferred independently from the SiO2 and MgO contents of mid-ocean ridge basalts. Archean cratonic peridotites, after filtering for the secondary effects of refertilization and orthopyroxene-metasomatism, give igneous protolith pressures and temperatures of 1-5 GPa (30-150 km) and 1400-1750 degrees C, similar to magmatic temperatures and pressures determined for Archean basalts thought to be representative of the thermal state of the Archean ambient mantle. Most importantly, cratonic peridotite protolith pressures and temperatures are shallower and hotter than their subsolidus equilibration pressures (3-7.5 GPa; 90-200 km) and temperatures (900-1300 degrees C), which reflects the recent thermal state of the cratonic lithosphere. Specifically, for individual samples with both melting and subsolidus thermobarometric constraints, we find that subsolidus pressures are 1-2 GPa (30-60 km) higher than their igneous protolith pressures although some of the deepest samples experienced minor increases in pressure. Collectively, these results support the suggestion that the building blocks of cratons were generated by hot shallow melting with a mantle potential temperature 200-300 degrees C warmer than the present. This shallowly generated mantle was subsequently thickened during orogenic episodes, culminating in the formation of a thick, stable craton. Whether such thickening has any modern analogs cannot be answered from this work alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pelagibaca bermudensis promotes biofuel competence of Tetraselmis striata in a broad range of abiotic stressors: dynamics of quorum-sensing precursors and strategic improvement in lipid productivity
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Amelioration of biofuel feedstock of microalgae using sustainable means through synthetic ecology is a promising strategy. The co-cultivation model (Tetraselmis striata and Pelagibaca bermudensis) was evaluated for the robust biofuel production under varying stressors as well as with the selected two-stage cultivation modes. In addition, the role of metabolic exudates including the quorum-sensing precursors was assessed. Results: The co-cultivation model innovated in this study supported the biomass production of T. striata in a saline/marine medium at a broad range of pH, salinity, and temperature/light conditions, as well as nutrient limitation with a growth promotion of 1.2-3.6-fold. Hence, this developed model could contribute to abiotic stress mitigation of T. striata. The quorum-sensing precursor dynamics of the growth promoting bacteria P. bermudensis exhibited unique pattern under varying stressors as revealed through targeted metabolomics (using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS). P. bermudensis and its metabolic exudates mutually promoted the growth of T. striata, which elevated the lipid productivity. Interestingly, hydroxy alkyl quinolones independently showed growth inhibition of T. striata on elevated concentration. Among two-stage cultivation modes (low pH, elevated salinity, and nitrate limitation), specifically, nitrate limitation induced a 1.5 times higher lipid content (30-31%) than control in both axenic and co-cultivated conditions. Conclusion: Pelagibaca bermudensis is established as a potential growth promoting native phycospheric bacteria for robust biomass generation of T. striata in varying environment, and two-stage cultivation using nitrate limitation strategically maximized the biofuel precursors for both axenic and co-cultivation conditions (T and T-PB, respectively). Optimum metabolic exudate of P. bermudensis which act as a growth substrate to T. striata surpasses the antagonistic effect of excessive hydroxy alkyl quinolones [HHQ, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines and PQS (pseudomonas quorum signal), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone].

AB  - Using several approaches, we studied the acid stress response of different strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. We showed that after an acid shock, the cell survival varied considerably between strains and that all the studied strains were able to develop an acid adaptive response. For one of these strains, we characterized, using two-dimensional electrophoresis, the modifications in the protein pattern induced by acid adaptation. Out of the 50 proteins up-regulated under the adaptive conditions, 21 were identified after N-terminal sequencing. They belong to different functional categories including stress response and general metabolism. To allow a larger genetic exploration of L. bulgaricus, the genome of the type strain ATCC 11842 was sequenced in collaboration with the Genoscope. All together, these genomic and post-genomic data should lead to a better understanding of L. bulgaricus physiology and its environmental adaptability.

TI  - Experimental and simulation analysis of biogas production from beverage wastewater sludge for electricity generation
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - This study assessed the biogas and methane production potential of wastewater sludge generated from the beverage industry. The optimization of the biogas production potential of a single fed-batch anaerobic digester was operated at different temperatures (25, 35, and 45 celcius), pH (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5), and organic feeding ratio (1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6) with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days. The methane and biogas productivity of beverage wastewater sludge in terms of volatile solid (VS) and volume was determined. The maximum production of biogas (15.4 m(3)/g VS, 9.3 m(3)) and methane content (6.3 m(3)/g VS, 3.8 m(3)) were obtained in terms of VS and volume at 8.5, 35 celcius, 1:3 of optimal pH, temperature, and organic loading ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum methane content (7.4 m(3)/g VS, 4.4 m(3)) and biogas production potential (17.9 m(3)/g VS, 10.8 m(3)) were achieved per day at room temperature. The total biogas and methane at 35 celcius (30 days) are 44.3 and 10.8 m(3)/g VS, respectively, while at 25 celcius (48 days) increased to 67.3 and 16.1 m(3)/g VS, respectively. Furthermore, the electricity-generating potential of biogas produced at room temperature (22.1 kWh at 24 days) and optimum temperature (18.9 kWh) at 40 days was estimated. The model simulated optimal HRT (25 days) in terms of biogas and methane production at optimum temperature was in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, we can conclude that the beverage industrial wastewater sludge has a huge potential for biogas production and electrification.

TI  - Proteome Evolution of Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Alvinellid Polychaetes Supports the Ancestry of Thermophily and Subsequent Adaptation to Cold in Some Lineages
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SP  - 279-296
AB  - Temperature, perhaps more than any other environmental factor, is likely to influence the evolution of all organisms. It is also a very interesting factor to understand how genomes are shaped by selection over evolutionary timescales, as it potentially affects the whole genome. Among thermophilic prokaryotes, temperature affects both codon usage and protein composition to increase the stability of the transcriptional/translational machinery, and the resulting proteins need to be functional at high temperatures. Among eukaryotes less is known about genome evolution, and the tube-dwelling worms of the family Alvinellidae represent an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses about the emergence of thermophily in ectothermic metazoans. The Alvinellidae are a group of worms that experience varying thermal regimes, presumably having evolved into these niches over evolutionary times. Here we analyzed 423 putative orthologous loci derived from 6 alvinellid species including the thermophilic Alvinella pompejana and Paralvinella sulfincola. This comparative approach allowed us to assess amino acid composition, codon usage, divergence, direction of residue changes and the strength of selection along the alvinellid phylogeny, and to design a new eukaryotic thermophilic criterion based on significant differences in the residue composition of proteins. Contrary to expectations, the alvinellid ancestor of all present-day species seems to have been thermophilic, a trait subsequently maintained by purifying selection in lineages that still inhabit higher temperature environments. In contrast, lineages currently living in colder habitats likely evolved under selective relaxation, with some degree of positive selection for low-temperature adaptation at the protein level.

TI  - Trematode Parasite Infection Affects Temperature Selection in Aquatic Host Snails*
VL  - 92
IS  - 1
SP  - 71-79
AB  - Animals infected by parasites or pathogens can exhibit altered behaviors that may reduce the costs of infection to the host or represent manipulations that benefit the parasite. Given that temperature affects many critical physiological processes, changes in thermoregulatory behaviors are an important consideration for infected hosts, especially ectotherms. Here we examined the temperature choices of freshwater snails (Helisoma trivolvis) that were or were not infected by a trematode (flatworm) parasite (Echinostoma trivolvis). Active snails that explored the experimental temperature gradient differed in their thermal preference based on their infection status, as parasitized snails chose to position themselves at a significantly higher temperature (mean: 25.4 degrees C) compared to those that were uninfected (mean: 23.3 degrees C). Given that snails rarely eliminate established trematode infections, we suggest that this altered thermal preference shown by infected hosts likely benefits the parasite by increasing the odds of successful transmission, either through enhanced production and emergence of infectious stages or by increasing spatial overlap with the next hosts of the complex life cycle. Further studies that employ experimental infections to examine temperature selection at different time points will be needed to understand the extent of altered host thermal preferences, as well as the possible benefits to both host and parasite.

VL  - 176
SP  - 1133-1143
AB  - Global warming, as many other threats, requires more activity from the government, and people inquire about this, rightfully so. However, the public and private sectors nowadays have a joint responsibility with society. Global warming has come out of the scientific community and shows that climate change is an important social, economic, and political issue. Currently the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transportation sector are the main polluter of the planet. For this reason, in this paper we propose a reflection on transport, which is an important sector of the economy, responsible for the generation of many jobs and wealth but, at the same time, it has negative impacts on people, companies, and the environment. Recent investigations demonstrate that mobility problems affects the life quality of the people, business productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) performance. In the face of the changes that we are experiencing, it is important to find alternatives that assistance governments in the decision making to solve the problem of traffic in large and medium-size cities and bring well-being to the population. The goal is to provide accurate tool to help take the best decisions in situations that most of the time has a lack of economic resources and transparency. Another motivation is to increase the productivity of companies and achieve sustainable development by reducing mobility problems and CO2 emissions. As outcomes of the paper, an in-depth study is presented on the subject that indicates a gap in the literature with fuzzy logic applied to sustainability. We indicate a sustainable option for the transport sector using algorithms for decision-making, and broaden the discussion on climate change and solutions to reduce the impacts caused by humanity. When the models were applied through a conceptual study, it was possible to provide an instrument generated on the use of algorithms that can aid decision making by getting qualitative data from a discussion with stakeholders on a topic. Finally, the document identifies the importance of the participation of stakeholder, reinforces legitimacy and transparency in decision-making processes and above all present a tool that can help governments to solve this problem. In short, this work proposes an original and valuable tool to be applied in the decision-making process for the sustainable transport sector based on the stakeholder engagement.

VL  - 83
IS  - 6
SP  - 984-996
AB  - Sharp environmental gradients encountered within the intertidal zone have driven the evolution of physiological adaptations that allow its inhabitants to maintain cellular function in the presence of fluctuating abiotic factors. These adaptations are mediated by gene-regulatory networks that, despite their inherent complexity, must remain evolvable and capable of responding to different selection pressures associated with specific ecological niches. Phosphorylation events catalyzed by cell-signaling enzymes represent a parsimonious mechanism to integrate new functional or regulatory properties into these gene-regulatory networks. In this study, proteins phosphorylated on consensus sequences for protein kinases A, B, and C; cyclin-dependent kinases; and mitogen-activated protein kinases, as well as the abundance of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (phospho-SAPK/JNK), were quantified in order to ascertain whether phosphorylation events are divergent among native (Mytilus californianus and Mytilus trossulus) and invasive (Mytilus galloprovincialis) species of mussels that differ in their tolerance toward environmental stress. Abundances of phosphorylated substrate proteins for each of the major signaling proteins that were investigated, as well as the abundance of phospho-SAPK/JNK, differed both within and between species during thermal and osmotic stress. These data suggest that modulating protein function via phosphorylation may be an important mechanism to integrate novel properties into stress-regulatory networks. In turn, differential phosphorylation during environmental stress may contribute to species-specific tolerances toward abiotic stress, interspecies dynamics, and biogeographic patterns in Mytilus congeners.

VL  - 121
SP  - 309-314
AB  - Earlier experiments with young Eucalyptus short-rotation coppice (SRC) in tropical environment have not evaluated the quality of whole-tree biomass fractions, and as such their total energy potential is still unknown. As this system is managed with a higher planting density and fertilization level compared to conventional plantations, the quality of forest biomass needs to be assessed. Hence, the goal of this study was to analyze how the short-rotation coppice affected the quality of stem, branches, and leaves used for power generation. Samples were collected from high-density plantation of Eucalyptus at two years old, and the thermochemical properties were evaluated. Carbon and ash content were lower for the stem fraction in higher density of planting, although the higher heating value was not significantly different from each treatment. Overall, the fuel quality of whole-forest biomass was not influenced by management practices. Statistically significant differences were found only between the whole-tree fractions. Eucalyptus SRC provided biomass qualitatively close to that from conventional forest systems and has potential to be quickly and feasible energy option. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SP  - 9978-9987
AB  - A novel WSC (wheat straw cellulose) based hydrogel was prepared by solution polymerization and then applied as a template for in situ preparation of Ni and Cu nanoparticles for further utilization as catalyst in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NaBH4. SEM with EDS, XRD, TGA, XPS and BET surface area analyses were employed to characterize the structure of WSC based hydrogel-nanometal (Ni or Cu) composites. The effects of several parameters such as the mesh size of catalyst, the amount of catalyst, the initial concentration of NaBH4 and the reaction temperature were studied. Based on the analysis of kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4 at different temperatures, the activation energy was 32.66 (34.83) kJ mol(-1) for WSC based hydrogel-Ni (Cu) composites. The WSC based hydrogel-Ni (Cu) composites can be used up to 5 times with 100% conversion and 77.5% (70%) activity. When the catalyst was stored for 30 days, the catalyst was remained 70% activity for hydrogel-Ni composites and 65% activity for hydrogel-Cu composites, respectively.

TI  - Highest drought sensitivity and lowest resistance to growth suppression are found in the range core of the tree Fagus sylvatica L. not the equatorial range edge
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 362-379
AB  - Biogeographical and ecological theory suggests that species distributions should be driven to higher altitudes and latitudes as global temperatures rise. Such changes occur as growth improves at the poleward edge of a species distribution and declines at the range edge in the opposite or equatorial direction, mirrored by changes in the establishment of new individuals. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that such processes are underway for a wide variety of species. Case studies from populations at the equatorial range edge of a variety of woody species have led us to understand that widespread growth decline and distributional shifts are underway. However, in apparent contrast, other studies report high productivity and reproduction in some range edge populations. We sought to assess temporal trends in the growth of the widespread European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) across its latitudinal range. We explored the stability of populations to major drought events and the implications for predicted widespread growth decline at its equatorial range edge. In contrast to expectations, we found greatest sensitivity and low resistance to drought in the core of the species range, whilst dry range edge populations showed particularly high resistance to drought and little evidence of drought-linked growth decline. We hypothesize that this high range edge resistance to drought is driven primarily by local environmental factors that allow relict populations to persist despite regionally unfavourable climate. The persistence of such populations demonstrates that range-edge decline is not ubiquitous and is likely to be driven by declining population density at the landscape scale rather than sudden and widespread range retraction.

TI  - Use of wet biomass for thermal power generation, oil and fiber production
SP  - 383-391
AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels continues to raise the atmosphere's CO, concentration at an alarming pace. Using fuel derived from biomass instead would have a neutral effect on world CO2 balance. In Germany alone, 40 million t of biomass could be produced on land not needed for food or forage production, the energy generated through biomass combustion replacing 10% of fossil fuel energy. An ecologically sound system of biomass production with cereals, sunflower, hemp or grasses uses little or no fertiliser input, no pesticides, and tolerates a certain weed population, thereby increasing the diversity of agro-ecosystems. Furthermore, double-cropping with minimum tillage provides an almost year-round plant or plant residue cover protecting the soil from both erosion and nutrient leaching. Under these conditions, biomass dry matter yields of 18-25 t ha(-1) can be obtained. Silage making and subsequent mechanical pressing increases biomass dry matter content and allows to recover nutrient-rich effluents, reducing the fuel's emission of noxious compounds during burning. Up to 50% of N contained in plant material and 40 80% of mineral elements can be eliminated from biomass fuel and the effluent can be mixed with liquid fertiliser for recycling of these nutrients. Valuable components such as oil or fibre may also be recovered from harvested biomass before burning improving the economic balance of the process. Naturally grown biomass harvested from parks, protected areas or public greens may also be used for fuel production if effective processing procedures are adopted to eliminate components generating unwanted emissions. At current low fossil fuel prices, government support to create an infrastructure of small thermal power plants may be needed and low cost biomass is required to render the concept of generating energy from biofuel economically viable.

TI  - Effective heritability of targets of sex-ratio selection under environmental sex determination
VL  - 24
IS  - 4
SP  - 784-794
AB  - Selection is expected to maintain primary sex ratios at an evolutionary equilibrium. In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), targets of sex-ratio selection include the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway (hereafter, sex determination threshold) and nest-site choice. However, offspring sex may be canalized for nests located in thermally extreme environments; thus, genetic variance for the sex determination threshold is not expressed and is invisible to direct selection. The concept of 'effective heritability' accounts for this dependence and provides a more realistic prediction of the expected evolutionary response to selection in the wild. Past estimates of effective heritability of the sex determination threshold, which were derived from laboratory data, suggested that the potential for the sex determination threshold to evolve in the wild was extremely low. We re-evaluated original estimates of this parameter by analysing field-collected measures of nest temperatures, vegetation cover and clutch sex ratios from nests in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We coupled these data with measurements of broad-sense heritability of the sex determination threshold in C. picta, using an experiment that splits clutches of eggs between a constant temperature (i.e. typical laboratory incubation) and a daily fluctuating temperature (i.e. similar to natural nests) with the same mean. We found that (i) the effective heritability of the sex determination threshold appears to have been historically underestimated and the effective heritability of nest-site choice has been overestimated and (ii) significant family-by-incubation treatment interaction exists for sex for C. picta between constant- and fluctuating-temperature regimes. Our results suggest that the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway may play a larger, more complex role in the microevolution of TSD than traditionally thought.

TI  - Abundant thorium as an alternative nuclear fuel Important waste disposal and weapon proliferation advantages
VL  - 60
SP  - 4-12
AB  - It has long been known that thorium-232 is a fertile radioactive material that can produce energy in nuclear reactors for conversion to electricity. Thorium-232 is well suited to a variety of reactor types including molten fluoride salt designs, heavy water CANDU configurations, and helium-cooled TRISO-fueled systems. Among contentious commercial nuclear power issues are the questions of what to do with long-lived radioactive waste and how to minimize weapon proliferation dangers. The substitution of thorium for uranium as fuel in nuclear reactors has significant potential for minimizing both problems. Thorium is three times more abundant in nature than uranium. Whereas uranium has to be imported, there is enough thorium in the United States alone to provide adequate grid power for many centuries. A well-designed thorium reactor could produce electricity less expensively than a next-generation coal-fired plant or a current-generation uranium-fueled nuclear reactor. Importantly, thorium reactors produce substantially less long-lived radioactive waste than uranium reactors. Thorium-fueled reactors with molten salt configurations and very high temperature thorium-based TRISO-fueled reactors are both recommended for priority Generation IV funding in the 2030 time frame.

AB  - Production of organically grown onions depending on the use of mulch and castor bean cake Onion is a highly consumed vegetable whose production is based on smallholder agriculture. The onion production is responsible for the generation of jobs and income for many farmers who have this as the only source of income. There is a growing demand for onion production technologies suitable for smallholders, with emphasis on agroecology. In this respect, we highlight the use of mulches and organic fertilizers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different mulches, associated to increasing doses of castor bean cake applied in side dressing on total production and diameter of onion bulbs grown in organic system. There was a significant effect of the mulch over the total yield and the yield obtained of different diameter classes of bulbs. There were no significant effects of side dressing with the castor bean cake, neither of the interaction between the mulch and the fertilization with castor bean cake. The beneficial effect of mulch which probably had more influence on the increasing of onion yield was the maintenance of moisture and reduction of soil temperature range.

TI  - Application of discrete choice models to predict white crappie temperature selection in two Missouri impoundments
VL  - 136
IS  - 4
SP  - 889-901
AB  - Temperature selection by white crappie Pomoxis annularis over 24 h was determined in two Missouri impoundments, Little Dixie Lake and Rocky Fork Lake, on six and five dates, respectively, during June-August 2001 using temperature-sensitive radio transmitters. Temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles showed that the habitable portions of the upper water columns associated with fish locations varied by as much as 6 degrees C in temperature. The habitable portions of water columns were subdivided into three strata (warm, moderate, and cool) such that each stratum covered an equivalent temperature range (<= 2 degrees C). Discrete choice models (DCMs) were developed for each impoundment to predict the relative probabilities of white crappies selecting the different strata in response to stratum height, DO concentration, average temperature throughout the habitable water column (AVG), and fish weight. For each impoundment, a distinct DCM containing AVG as the sole predictor variable was most supported by the data. Cross-verification indicated that the DCMs accurately predicted white crappie thermal strata selection within the impoundments for which they were developed but that they were inaccurate when applied across the impoundments. The DCM for Little Dixie Lake predicted that white crappies mostly select warm strata at AVGs less than 27 degrees C and mostly select cool strata at AVGs of 27 degrees C or more. In contrast, the DCM for Rocky Fork Lake predicted that white crappies continue to select warm strata until AVGs reach 30 degrees C, select moderate strata at AVGs of 30-32 degrees C, and select cool strata only when AVGs exceed 32 degrees C. The predicted mean daily thermal experiences of the white crappies in each impoundment, obtained by multiplying the relative selection probabilities for the different strata by the average temperatures in those strata, remained within 0.5 degrees C of the mean of observed temperatures experienced by white crappies. These findings indicate that discrete choice modeling provides a novel and effective approach for predicting the daily thermal experiences of fish.

TI  - An ancient recipe for flood-basalt genesis
VL  - 476
IS  - 7360
SP  - 316-U77
AB  - Large outpourings of basaltic lava have punctuated geological time, but the mechanisms responsible for the generation of such extraordinary volumes of melt are not well known(1). Recent geochemical evidence suggests that an early-formed reservoir may have survived in the Earth's mantle for about 4.5 billion years (ref. 2), and melts of this reservoir contributed to the flood basalt emplaced on Baffin Island about 60 million years ago(3-5). However, the volume of this ancient mantle domain and whether it has contributed to other flood basalts is not known. Here we show that basalts from the largest volcanic event in geologic history-the Ontong Java plateau(1,6,7)-also exhibit the isotopic and trace element signatures proposed for the early-Earth reservoir2. Together with the Ontong Java plateau, we suggest that six of the largest volcanic events that erupted in the past 250 million years derive from the oldest terrestrial mantle reservoir. The association of these large volcanic events with an ancient primitive mantle source suggests that its unique geochemical characteristics-it is both hotter (it has greater abundances of the radioactive heat-producing elements) and more fertile than depleted mantle reservoirs-may strongly affect the generation of flood basalts.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of a solar still-assisted TEC-AWG system for atmospheric water generation
VL  - 44
IS  - 8
AB  - During recent years, water production from atmospheric air has been widely introduced as one of the most promising solutions for providing remote regions with potable water. An experimental investigation was conducted here on a newly designed solar still-assisted thermoelectric cooling atmospheric water generation (TEC-AWG) system in order to evaluate the influence of various operating factors such as solar radiation intensity, ambient and TEC channel outlet temperatures, relative humidity, as well as the effect of insulating the TEC channel, and utilizing photovoltaic power (PV) on water production and system performance. In order to increase the moisture content of the TEC channel inlet air; the incoming air was directed via a solar still prior to its entrance through the TEC channel. Tests were performed under realistic climate conditions of Babol, Iran (36.53 degrees N, 52.67 degrees E), over nine typical summer days. Three sets of comparative experiments were carried out between a backup powered-TEC channel without insulation (Model A as the reference model), a backup powered-TEC channel with insulation (Model B), and a PV-powered TEC channel with insulation (Model C). The obtained results demonstrated average annual production of 845, 2064, and 1315 L/m(2) for models A, B, and C, respectively. These data correlate to 144.3% (for Model B) and 55.6% (for Model C) increase in average annual production. Maximum average annual production of 2064 L/m(2) which was acquired during Model B experiments, is higher than that of reported for a simple solar still (i.e., similar to 1511 L/m(2)). Additionally, system performance (i.e., the ratio between the generated water and consumed power); of 0.07, 0.20 and 0.30 mL/Wh was obtained for models A, B, and C, respectively. These data imply the superiority of Model B in terms of water production and Model C in terms of system performance. Comparing the system preperformance results of the models B and C with some previous studies, demonstrates the viability of the current design and therefore, the present newly designed setup can be effectively utilized as a reliable AWG device.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of thermal energy production from short-rotation willow biomass in Southern Ontario, Canada
VL  - 204
SP  - 343-352
AB  - As part of efforts to address the root causes of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion, many regions in the world are considering sustainable biomass feedstocks for renewable energy production. Prior to making such large-scale shifts in primary energy feedstocks, location-specific research is still needed to understand the environmental impacts and benefits of biomass associated with its many potential applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate environmental and energy impacts associated with generating 1 MJ of thermal energy from direct combustion of short rotation willow (SRW) pellets for 2 purposes: to determine where improvements could be made in the life cycle of SRW bioenergy to reduce impacts, and to compare SRW bioenergy to fossil fuel (light fuel oil and natural gas) for thermal energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using primary data on SRW biomass production collected from field trials at the Guelph Agroforestry site in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, as well as carbon sequestration rates modeled based on local conditions. Results showed that direct combustion of SRW pellets reduced global warming potential (GWP) by almost 85% relative to the fossil fuels. However, relative to fossil fuels, SRW energy had higher impacts in certain categories (e.g. eutrophiEation and respiratory effects), due to biomass combustion and N inputs (inorganic fertilizer and SRW leaf inputs) for biomass production. Soil nitrous oxide emissions, from the N inputs, dominated the GWP, but a sensitivity analysis showed that soil carbon sequestered by SRW biomass during growth could reduce the GWP by 23%. Pelletizing the SRW biomass prior to combustion affected the energy ratio and accounted for almost 85% of non-renewable energy use in the life cycle of bioenergy. Location specific factors that affected environmental performance of the bioenergy system included agro-climatic conditions, management practices, and conversion technologies. Nevertheless, most of the impacts associated with SRW thermal energy generation can be minimized through better fertilizer management, by using alternate sources of fertilizer, by improving yields, and by the use of cleaner wood combustion technologies with emissions controls.

TI  - Development of MBE II-VI Epilayers on GaAs(211)B
VL  - 41

SP  - 2707-2713
AB  - Large-area, low-cost substrates are envisioned for next-generation HgCdTe infrared focal-plane arrays (IRFPA). Si, GaAs, Ge, and InSb have been previously examined as potential candidates. Fabrication of IRFPAs based on these substrates is limited by fundamental materials properties that potentially lead to lower detector performance and operability. Lattice and thermal mismatch between the substrate and epilayer are just two of several material factors that must be considered. We have reviewed these factors in the context of more recent data, and determined it worthwhile to revisit the use of GaAs substrates for epitaxial growth of HgCdTe. Our study starts with an evaluation of the surface quality (epireadiness) of commercially available (211) B-oriented GaAs substrates. Molecular beam epitaxial growth of CdTe buffer layers and subsequent HgCdTe absorber layers are performed in separate vacuum-interconnected chambers. The importance of optimization of the CdTe buffer layer growth for high-quality HgCdTe is detailed through surface morphology and x-ray studies. x-Ray diffraction rocking-curve full-width at half-maximum values as low as 52 arcsec have been obtained. Long-wave infrared Hg1-x Cd (x) Te (x = 0.23) has been grown on these buffer layers, producing cross-hatch-dominated surface morphologies, with dislocation densities as low as similar to 3 x 10(6) cm(-2). We have also obtained (for optimized layers), 80-K Hall-effect n-type carrier concentration and electron mobility of approximately similar to 1.5 x 10(15) cm(-3) and 1 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively. Finally, we briefly compare GaAs and Si in light of our preliminary investigation.

TI  - A standardized Physical Equivalent Temperature urban heat map at 1-m spatial resolution to facilitate climate stress tests in the Netherlands
VL  - 181
AB  - In the Netherlands, municipalities and other sub-national governments have to conduct climate stress tests to examine the societal impact of heat load by citizens. So far, these parties have been hindered by the abundance of contrasting urban heat maps produced with different metrics and methods by different agencies. To unify the stress tests, we present a methodology for a standardized urban heat map at 1-m spatial resolution by selecting the Physical Equivalent Temperature (PET) as metric for heat stress. First we present an empirical regression model for PET, based on a variety of weather data and street configurations in the human thermal energy balance model Rayman. Thereafter, this empirical PET-model is evaluated for the midsized town Wageningen (the Netherlands). Meteorological observations taken at a nearby reference site and straightforward geographical data have been used as model input. Also, established methods were applied and elaborated to account for the urban heat island effect and wind speed reduction in the city. The presented method is validated against bike traverse observations of PET. Wind speed is the most challenging feature to map, due to its unsteady and local behaviour in cities. As a result, an afternoon averaged PET heat map is demonstrated as standard for an extreme heat day (1:1000 summer half year days), and a cumulative exceedance PET heat map for a representative year. Furthermore, a heat map is projected for 2050 according a warm climate change scenario.

VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 57-70
AB  - Background: Although the recent past has witnessed a surge in the study of forgiveness, little is known about unforgiveness. This study aims to understand the nature and attributes of unforgiveness. Methods: We used a qualitative design. The sample consisted of 14 participants (22-32 years). We collected data using a semistructured interview protocol. The interview content was tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the thematic analysis method. Results: We identified five themes: a complex process, multiple causes, benefits, negative consequences, and strategies to reduce unforgiveness. Challenges to trust, unforgiveness-generated behaviors, and mixed emotionality of transgressions made it a complex process. Transgressors' misconduct, challenges to regard and relationship, and negative feelings associated with transgressions were identified as the main causes. Unforgiveness benefits victims by increasing their adaptability, self-worth, productivity, well-being, and relationship outcomes. Some negative consequences of relationships, emotionality, self-worth, etc., have also been described. Positive changes in transgressors' behaviors and poor conditions and the likelihood of revictimization were described as mechanisms to reduce unforgiveness. Discussion: Contrary to previous views, which assumed unforgiveness represents only cold emotion and rumination, our findings reveal that unforgiveness is a complex process. Aside from certain negative consequences, it also serves some adaptive functions.

AB  - This paper is an introduction to the research and training activities carried out under the Euratom 7th Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2011) in the field of nuclear fission science and technology, covering in particular nuclear systems and safety, and including innovative reactor systems and partitioning and transmutation. It is based on the more than 40 invited lectures that were delivered by Euratom project coordinators and keynote speakers at the FISA-2009 Conference (FISA, 2009), organised by the European Commission DG Research, 22-24 June 2009, Prague, Czech Republic. The Euratom programme must be considered in the context of current and future nuclear technology and the respective research effort: Generation-II (i.e. yesterday, NPP construction 1970-2000): safety and reliability of nuclear facilities and energy independence in order to ensure security of supply worldwide; Generation-III (i.e. today, construction 2000-2040+): continuous improvement of safety and reliability, and increased industrial competitiveness in a growing energy market; Generation-IV (i.e. tomorrow, construction from 2040) for increased sustainability though optimal utilisation of natural resources and waste minimisation, and increased proliferation resistance. Consequently, the focus of the lectures devoted to Generation-II and -III is on the major scientific challenges and technological developments needed to guarantee safety and reliability, in particular issues associated with plant lifetime extension and operation. The focus of the lectures devoted to Generation-IV is on the design objectives and associated research issues that have been agreed upon internationally, in particular the ambitious criteria and technology goals established at the international level by the Generation-IV International Forum (GIF). In the future, electricity must continue to be produced competitively, and in addition high temperature process heat may also be required, while exploiting a maximum of fissile and fertile material and recycling all actinides, both safely and reliably. Scientific viability studies and technological performance tests for each Generation-IV system are now being carried out in many European Union (EU) Member States, in collaboration with other laboratories worldwide as part of the inter-governmental GIF agreement. The ultimate phase of commercial deployment will be from 2040, but no one can predict accurately when industry and investors will make firm, often difficult decisions regarding the construction of these very innovative Generation-IV systems. However, to be deployed commercially, it must first be demonstrated that Generation-IV technology can be a beneficial, responsible and sustainable response to the long-term challenges faced by society to establish a low-carbon economy.

AB  - Eighteen species of cutworm moths were collected as larvae feeding at night on grapevines, Vitis sp L (Vitaceae), in south-central British Columbia, Canada, during April and May from 2004 to 2008. Ten species belonged to two genera, Abagrotis Smith and Euxoa Hubner. Abagrotis orbis (Grote), A nefascia (Smith), and A. reedi Buckett accounted for over 85% of cutworms reared to adulthood. Abagrotis orb's and A reedi were found in all locations, the former accounted for nearly 90% of larvae collected from vineyards on warm sandy soils Abagrotis nefascia was largely restricted to cooler sites with heavier soils For laboratory-reared A. orbis, pupal mass was highest and sex ratios were approximately equal when larvae were reared either on a pinto bean-based diet prepared with the recommended amount of water or on a commercial black cutworm diet and 50% of the recommended water Survival to adult eclosion was significantly higher on the black cutworm diet, but because this was thicker than the pinto bean-based diet it was impractical to use. To date, A orbis, A nefascia, and A. reed, have been laboratory-reared continuously on artificial diet for more than six generations.

AB  - The study of coffee seed reaches different areas of research. Its stimulating effect besides other biological activities, in addition to more than 1,000 volatile chemicals formed during roasting from chemical transformations of its fixed constituents like caffeine, trigoneline, chlorogenic acid, carbohydrate, lipid constituents, including diterpenes and fatty acids (free and esterified), among others, add value to coffee and residues generated until reach its warm beverage. Several by-products are generated during wet and the dry processing, and also by soluble coffee industries. Such by-products can be a source of raw materials for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics, and are often used in power generation in boilers for mechanical dryers and fertilizer. Therefore, this review aims to show the diversity of chemical compounds that can be used from by-products generated in the coffee process.

TI  - EUROCROP: Research strategy for European arable farming
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
SP  - 192-197
AB  - EUROCROP was a concerted action to develop a research strategy for European arable farming. Research institutes and various stake-holders drew Lip the main research priorities for individual arable crops and for six transversal elements: "farming systems", "farm economics", "outlets and markets", "quality of agricultural products", "environmental impacts" and "socio-economic issues". The social relevance and priority of research goals were assessed on the basis of four future scenarios: "trade liberalisation", "Europe of regions", "green Europe" and "global warming". Agroscope Reckenholz-Tanikon ART Research Station chaired the work group on environmental impacts. It was shown that the importance of conservation and the efficient use of the production resources energy, water, nutrients and soil will increase in future, with optimisation of the sustainability of cultivation systems and the nitrogen cycle being particularly important. Other issues relevant to the competitiveness of arable crops were prices, production costs as well as yield increase and stability. Adaptability to changing production conditions was deemed essential for the future, particularly in the case of plant protection. From the environmental point of view mention should also be made of issues like biodiversity, landscape ecology and protection of the aquatic environment, which have no direct relationship to productivity. Research priorities can turn out to be very different in different regions.

TI  - Elevation dependence of drought legacy effects on vegetation greenness over the Tibetan Plateau
VL  - 295
AB  - Extreme drought events exert both immediate and prolonged influences on terrestrial ecosystems, yet the patterns and mechanisms of the delayed effects of extreme drought on alpine ecosystems remain largely unknown. In this study, we use satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to examine the legacy effect of severe drought events on vegetation greenness across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A pervasive, negative drought legacy effect, lasting about one year, is detected for all plant functional types including forests, shrubs and grasslands on the TP. The magnitude of the identified legacy effect, namely, the reduced growing-season NDVI in the first year post-drought, is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits a clear altitude dependence, while divergent relationships between elevation and the legacy effect are observed between alpine meadow and steppe. For alpine meadow, more pronounced legacy effects occur at higher altitudes with lower precipitation and temperature, suggesting a weaker drought resilience of alpine meadow under dryer and colder conditions. Whereas for alpine steppe, the magnitude of the negative legacies reduces as precipitation decreases along the elevation, which might be due to a greater adaptability to drought under more arid conditions that enables plant communities to recover to their normal state faster in these very dry regions. Our results advance the understanding of drought legacy effects on TP alpine ecosystems and highlight future avenues for research into how different alpine ecosystem types will respond to drought stress.

TI  - First Pacific record of the north Atlantic ascidian Molgula citrina - bioinvasion or circumpolar distribution?
VL  - 5
IS  - 4
SP  - 369-378
AB  - The small brooding ascidian Molgula citrina Alder and Hancock, 1848 has long been known as a common inhabitant of shallow waters on both sides of the north Atlantic on subtidal natural hard substrates and also as a fouler of floating docks. There arc published records from the White Sea (NW Russia), but none from the north Pacific. In May and August 2008, a number of adult brooding Molgula sp. specimens were collected from floating docks at the small fishing village of Seldovia on the Kenai Peninsula at Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Morphologically these individuals exactly match Atlantic specimens of Molgula citrina in all characters that were examined. The unique constellation of characters for this species differentiates it from all other Molgula species, as noted by Van Name (1945). In addition, the full-length 18S and 28S rDNA sequences are identical for both the Alaska specimens and New England M. citrina. Is this a new invasion, or is M. citrina a northern circumpolar species that was somehow overlooked? If this new record indicates a natural distribution, why has it not been collected before? If it is a recent introduction, it is unlikely that M. citrina, an inhabitant of cold waters, could survive in sea chests of ships from the N. Atlantic arriving in Alaska via the Panama Canal, but the intriguing idea exists of transport from Atlantic to Pacific through the Northwest or Northeast Passages. As global warming diminishes the ice cover in this region, more and more ships arc traversing the Northwest Passage across northern Canada as well as the NE Passage across northern Russia, representing significant new routes for anthropogenic transport of marine species. The tadpoles of this small brooder arc retained for some time after hatching, resulting in an extremely short free larval life, but could survive as metamorphosed juveniles attached in sea chests or free-floating in ballast water. They have a wide temperature tolerance and once they metamorphose can live free-floating in sea water for some time. They become very sticky and will ultimately stick to whatever they contact. Thus they could conceivably live for many generations in sea chests and sustain a viable population from which to invade new habitats.

TI  - Using Polynomial Interpolation for Reproducing Multi-Valued Responses of Physical Unclonable Functions on FPGAs
AB  - A well-known problem when using Physical Unclonable Functions for secret key generation and storage, is the instability of PUF responses due to environmental conditions like temperature variations. Using Ring Oscillator PUFs (RO-PUFs), a response bit is usually derived based on the comparison of a RO frequency with either a threshold or another RO frequency. Especially for multi-valued PUFs it is of importance to decrease RO frequency errors before digitization. Otherwise, these errors can result in a huge amount of bit-flips. To counteract environmental influence in the reproduction phase, we propose to map a frequency, which might be remeasured under a temperature condition different from initialization, closer to the initial frequency by using a method based on polynomial interpolation. This paper presents how such an approach can decrease errors in multi-valued responses and evaluates the error based on the used polynomial order and thus complexity.

TI  - Fabrication and characterization of microsieve electrode array (mu SEA) enabling cell positioning on 3D electrodes
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
AB  - Here the fabrication and characterization of a novel microelectrode array for electrophysiology applications is described, termed a micro sieve electrode array (mu SEA). This silicon based mu SEA device allows for hydrodynamic parallel positioning of single cells on 3D electrodes realized on the walls of inverted pyramidal shaped pores. To realize the mu SEA, a previously realized silicon sieving structure is provided with a patterned boron doped poly-silicon, connecting the contact electrodes with the 3D sensing electrodes in the pores. A LPCVD silicon-rich silicon nitride layer was used as insulation. The selective opening of this insulation layer at the ends of the wiring lines allows to generate well-defined contact and sensing electrodes according to the layout used in commercial microelectrode array readers. The main challenge lays in the simultaneously selective etching of material at both the planar surface (contact electrode) as well as in the sieving structure containing the (3D) pores (sensing electrodes). For the generation of 3D electrodes in the pores a self-aligning technique was developed using the pore geometry to our advantage. This technique, based on sacrificial layer etching, allows for the fine tuning of the sensing electrode surface area and thus supports the positioning and coupling of single cells on the electrode surface in relation to the cell size. Furthermore, a self-aligning silicide is formed on the sensing electrodes to favour the electrical properties. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the working principle of the mu SEA using different types of neuronal cells. Capture efficiency in the pores was >70% with a 70% survival rate of the cell maintained for up to 14 DIV. The TiSi2-boron-doped-poly-silicon sensing electrodes of the mu SEA were characterized, which indicated noise levels of < 15 mu V and impedance values of 360 k Omega. These findings potentially allow for future electrophysiological measurements using the mu SEA.

TI  - Influence of warming temperatures on coregonine embryogenesis within and among species
VL  - 848
IS  - 18
SP  - 4363-4385
AB  - The greatest known global response of lakes to climate change has been an increase in water temperatures. The responses of many lake fishes to warming water temperatures are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. We experimentally evaluated the responses of embryos from a group of cold, stenothermic fishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae) to increased incubation temperatures. Study groups included cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario (USA), and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi (Finland). Embryos from artificial crossings were incubated at water temperatures of 2.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 9.0 degrees C, and their responses were quantified for developmental and morphological traits. Embryo survival, incubation period, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to incubation temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with incubation temperature within study groups. However, varying magnitudes of responses among study groups suggested differential levels of developmental plasticity to climate change. Differential levels of parental effects indicate genetic diversity may enable all study groups to adapt to cope with some degree of changing environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the coregonines sampled within and among systems may have a wide range of embryo responses to warming incubation conditions.

VL  - 20

SP  - 245-255
AB  - Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma (Hym. Trichogrammatidae) have been successfully utilized for biocontrol of several Lepidopteran pests worldwide. Because of their low host specificity Trichogramma can be mass reared more easily in large numbers and on different natural and factitious hosts. Life table parameters were assessed for Trichogramma cacoeciae Marchall, T. evanescens Westwood and T. brassicae Bezdenko on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and Cadra cautella Walker at three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) as the potential factitious hosts for mass rearing. Female longevity ranged between 9.77 and 2.56 days in our experiments. Fecundity ranged from 73 to 91 parasitized eggs in C. cautella and 76-109 parasitized eggs in E. kuehniella. T. brassicae exhibit similar values of the intrinsic rate of increase ratio (r(m)) 0.5407 and 0.5478; the finite rates of increase (lambda) were 1.717 and 1.7295 and the doubling times 1.28 and 1.26 at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively, in C. cautella. The mean duration of one generation (T) varied between 8.25 and 13.37 days for T. cacoeciae, 8.14 and 13.47 days for T. brassicae and 8.23 and 13.18 days for T. evanescens in C. cautella. Generation times for T. cacoeciae varied between 8.23 and 14.68 days, 8.28 and 14.37 days for T. brassicae, and 7.74 and 14.58 days for T. evanescens in E. kuehniella eggs. Both species (T. cacoeciae, T. brassicae) had the same intrinsic rate of increase (r(m); 0.5700 and 0.5704), finite rate of increase (lambda; 1.7682, 1.7691) and doubling time (Dt, 1.21) at 30 degrees C in E. kuehniella, respectively.

TI  - Environmental evaluation of european ammonia production considering various hydrogen supply chains
VL  - 130
AB  - Ammonia synthesis is a topic of high interest in the industry as the market continues to expand and demand increases. The current ammonia production route is very energy and carbon-intensive, relying greatly on natural gas both as feedstock as well as for heat and power generation within the plant. In the present work, a cradle-togate environmental assessment of conventional and greener hydrogen production routes integrated with ammonia synthesis is carried out according to ReCIPe impact assessment method. Hydrogen production through conventional steam methane reforming coupled with gas-liquid carbon dioxide absorption by amines and chilled ammonia, electrolysis, and iron-based chemical looping are analysed and compared. Mass and energy balances from process flow modelling are used as inputs for the environmental evaluation using Life Cycle Assessment. The system boundaries considered in this work include: i) main processes: ammonia production, hydrogen production, carbon dioxide separation; ii) upstream processes: nitrogen, natural gas, ilmenite, Methyl-DiEthanolAmine, chilled ammonia and catalysts supply chains, iii) downstream processes: carbon dioxide compression, transport and storage, degradation/disposal of solvents/oxygen carrier. The results show that natural gas-based ammonia synthesis integrated with chemical looping hydrogen production gives the highest reduction in Global Warming Potential while six out of the nine investigated impact indicators (excluding Global Warming Potential) suffer an increase between 30% and 60%. In the case of hydrogen produced from electrolysis, unless the electricity necessary for electrolysis is obtained from non-fossil sources, it results in the highest overall emissions to air, water and soil.

TI  - Modular solar storage system for medium scale energy demand mining in the North of Chile
VL  - 69
SP  - 638-643
AB  - The current legal framework for the development of renewable energies in Chile offers very favorable conditions for small scale electric generation systems. Incentives range from tariff exemptions on distribution and up to a 5% guaranteed supply rights to regulated customers. Such conditions allow for a viable and fast growing environment for the developments of those generation systems based on the CSP which incorporate optimized storage systems. These systems are likely to play a vital role in meeting the increasing demand for energy from the copper mining sector in the north of Chile as well as that of the smaller electricity networks and local communities. In this direction, the University of Antofagasta. Chile, has developed the implementation and construction of a modular solar storage system, using new ternary and quaternary- nitrate mixtures, where in addition to collecting the heat of industrial/mining processes and store them for later use, proposes its implementation in isolated rural systems in the Chilean Norte Grande. The new ternary and quaternary Heat Transfer Fluid (HTE), designed with the addition of Ca(NO3)(2) and LiNO3 to solar salt, shows a work temperature range of 130 to 600 degrees C. This temperature range, together with the adequate heat capacity of salt and the potential for storage approximately 175 kWh per day to this system, making it suitable to meet the demands of evaluated areas. The economic viability of these new salts has been analyzed taking into 'account the sources of nitrates in the country, as well as the cost for storage density offered by these new fluids.

VL  - 71

AB  - Diplopods are very susceptible to various degrees of environmental disturbance, particularly climate, altitude and diet. In order to increase our understanding of millipede ecological plasticity, we used fertility tables to access and to compare the fertility and survival of two populations of the parthenogenetic species Poratia salvator from two areas with distinct characteristics. Collecting was conducted in two localities within the state of Mato Grosso, in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, municipality of Nossa Senhora do Livramento, and in the municipality of Varzea Grande. The specimens were maintained at room temperature. In the first generation, individuals from the Pantanal of Mato Grosso population reproduced early and also died earlier when compared with individuals from the Varzea Grande population. Furthermore, the population from the Pantanal had a lower net reproduction rate and a higher intrinsic growth rate than the population from the Varzea Grande. The generation time was lower for the Pantanal population than for the Varzea Grande population. In the second generation, the net reproduction rate observed for both populations was higher than that observed in the first generation, suggesting an increase in the reproductive potential of the females throughout their lives. The intrinsic growth rate of both populations decreased as a function of an increase in generation time observed in the second generation. As a result, the population growth rate in the second generation was slower when compared with the first generation, probably a result of the longer life expectancy of the second generation, which may have become adapted to the artificial conditions of the experiment.

VL  - 64

SP  - 624-+
AB  - The extremely large number of leaves produced by terrestrial and aquatic plants pl ovine habitats for colonization by a diversity of microorganisms. This review focuses on the bacterial component of leaf microbial communities, with emphasis on Pseudomonas syringae-a species that participates in leaf ecosystems as a pathogen, ice nucleus, and epiphyte. Among the diversity of bacteria that colonize leaves, none has received wide, attention than P. syringae, as it gained notoriety for being the first recombinant organism (Ice(-) P. syringae) to be deliberately introduced into the environment. We focus on P. syringae to illustrate the attractiveness and somewhat unique opportunities provided by leaf ecosystems for addressing fundamental questions of microbial population dynamics and mechanisms of plant-bacterium interactions. Leaf ecosystems are dynamic and ephemeral. The physical environment surrounding phyllosphere microbes changes continuously with daily cycles in temperature, radiation relative humidity, wind velocity, and leaf wetness. Slightly longer-term changes occur as weather systems pass. Seasonal climatic changes impose still a longer cycle. The physical and physiological characteristics of leaves change as they expand, mature, and senesce and as host phenology changes. Many of these factors influence the development of populations of P. syringae upon populations of leaves. P. syringae was first studied for its ability to cause disease on plants. However, disease causation is but one aspect of its life strategy. The bacterium can be found in association with healthy leaves, growing and surviving for many generations on the surfaces of leaves as an epiphyte. A number of genes and traits have been identified that contribute to the fitness of P. syringae in the phyllosphere. While still in their infancy, such research efforts demonstrate that the P. syringae-leaf ecosystem is a particularly attractive system with which to bridge the gap between what is known about the molecular, biology of genes linked to pathogenicity and the ecology and epidemiology of associated diseases as they occur in natural settings, the field.

TI  - Developmental stability and genetic architecture: a comparison within and across thermal regimes in tadpoles
VL  - 15
IS  - 4
SP  - 625-633
AB  - We investigated homogeneity of growth and development as indices of developmental stability in sibling tadpoles from two sampling regions of the common frog, Rana temporaria. One region is characterized by relatively warm breeding ponds with a short activity season ('north'), and one by relatively cool breeding ponds and a long activity season ('south'). Tadpoles from the two regions were raised in three different temperatures selected to mimic the natural variation throughout the range. The results show that (1) north tadpoles respond with a relatively greater increase in growth with increased temperature than south tadpoles, (2) mean growth rate and its coefficient of variation were negatively correlated in the temperature regime in which a population was primarily under selection in the wild, whereas no such correlation was found at temperatures more seldom encountered in the natural populations, (3) phenotypic and genetic correlations between morphological traits within individuals were positive and were relatively higher in north than south tadpoles in the warm treatment, but higher for south tadpoles in the cold treatment and (4) across thermal environments, south tadpoles showed significant genetic correlations, whereas the correlations for north tadpoles were not significantly different from zero. South tadpoles showed only positive genetic correlations (n = 30), whereas 14 of 30 correlation coefficients were negative in north tadpoles. In conclusion, developmental stability for growth and morphometry was higher at `optimal' conditions and decreased at the tail ends of the reaction norms within regions, with marked differences reflecting selection history between regions.

VL  - 40

SP  - 441-458
AB  - The effects of extended autumn daylength and winter fasting on growth and smolting were studied in one-year-old Saimaa landlocked salmon. Underyearling juveniles were either exposed to extended light LD 20:4 regime (LD group) during August-October or reared under routine fish-farm illumination (ND croup). After the photoperiod manipulation, LID fish were larger and a greater number of them belonged to upper size classes in comparison with ND fish. Upper size class fish from both photoperiod groups were selected for further experiments in which the fish were either fed or fasted during winter. Contrary to the LD fish, the ND fish increased their length and weight during January-March by which they achieved the size of the LID fish. There was a clear size difference between the ND fed and fasted groups during March-April, but the fasted fish compensated for their growth Suppression soon after the feeding was started again. The activity of gill Na+,K+-ATPase was lower in the ND fasted group during January-March as compared with that of the ND fed group suggesting that smolting may be switched off by poor nutritional conditions. The different gill Na+,K+-ATPase profiles between the ND and the LD fish may indicate disturbed endogenous smolting cycle of the LD fish. However, despite these differences, all groups, independently of the treatment, completed their smolting at the same time in June as indicated by elevated gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, enhanced salinity tolerance, and hypoosmoregulatory ability. Lower levels of plasma sodium, chloride and magnesium in freshwater observed in all Groups during spring-early summer coincident with other changes typical for smolting indicate gradually increasing maladaptation of the fish to freshwater. These results as well as an observed increase in potassium concentration in freshwater during spring-summer suggest that downstream migration is more like a passive than active process.

Here, we tested this prediction by comparing a population of ringed sealsPusa hispidalocated at high latitudes as part of their core range (core) with a population located at the southern extremity of their range (peripheral). First, we compared the two regions' environmental trends in timing of sea-ice breakup and freeze-up, open-water duration and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We found that the core region shifted to progressively warmer conditions in the early 1990s; whereas, in the peripheral region, the warming trend shifted in 1999 to one with no warming trend but high inter-annual variability. Next, we examined how body condition, inferred from blubber depth, responded to temporal changes in sea-ice and climatic variables - variables that have been shown to influence ringed seal demography. Core seals displayed minimal seasonal changes in body condition; whereas peripheral seals displayed a 20-60% amplitude seasonal change in body condition with a phase shift to earlier initiation of fat accumulation and loss. Finally, we tested for interannual differences and found that both core and peripheral seals responded similarly with decreased body condition following more positive NAO. Environmental variables influenced body condition in opposite directions between the two regions with core seals declining in body condition with later spring breakup and shorter open-water duration, whereas peripheral seals showed opposite relationships. Seals living at the core likely benefit from an evolved match between adaptation and environmental variation resulting in dampened seasonal and interannual fluctuations in body condition. Knowledge of how different populations respond to environmental change depending on geographic location within a species range can assist in anticipating population specific responses to climate warming.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Ecological Quality and Spatial Heterogeneity Based on Remote Sensing: A Case Study of the Rapid Urbanization of Wuhan City
VL  - 13
IS  - 21
AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly affects the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem and the foundation of regional ecosystem services, thereby detrimentally influencing the ecological environment and urban ecological security. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also require accurate and timely assessments of where people live in order to develop, implement and monitor sustainable development policies. Sustainable development also emphasizes the process of protecting the ecological environment for future generations while maintaining the current needs of mankind. We propose a comprehensive evaluation method for urban ecological quality (UEQ) using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS images to extract remote sensing information representing four ecological elements, namely humidity, greenness, heat and dryness. An improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (IRSEI) evaluation model is constructed by combining the entropy weight method and principal component analysis. This modeling is applied to the city of Wuhan, China, from 1995 to 2020. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted on the geographic clusters of the IRSEI. The results show that (1) from 1995 to 2015, the mean IRSEI of Wuhan city decreased from 0.60 to 0.47, indicating that environmental deterioration overwhelmed improvements; (2) the global Moran's I for IRSEI ranged from 0.535 to 0.592 from 1995 to 2020, indicating significant heterogeneity in its spatial distribution, highlighting that high and low clusters gradually developed at the edge of the city and at the city center, respectively; (3) the high clusters are mainly distributed in the Huangpi and Jiangxia districts, and the low clusters at the city center, which exhibits a dense population and intense human activity. This paper uses remote sensing index methods to evaluate UEQ as a scientific theoretical basis for the improvement of UEQ, the control of UEQ and the formulation of urban sustainable development strategies in the future. Our results show that the UEQ method is a low-cost, feasible and simple technique that can be used for territorial spatial control and spatiotemporal urban sustainable development.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen mineralization on paddy rice yield under low nitrogen input conditions in irrigated rice-based multiple cropping with intensive cropping of vegetables in southwest China
VL  - 315
IS  - 1
SP  - 195-209
AB  - The farm household responsibility system (FHRS) was adopted in Chinese rural areas during the economic reform in the early 1980s. Since then, many farm households have increased cropping intensity by using large quantities of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in their responsible fields to increase agricultural income. However, intensive cropping systems with low N input are still common in remote places of the southwestern region of China. Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in intensive cropping systems is critical for sustaining agricultural productivity and environmental quality for future generations. The effects of intensive cropping of vegetables on paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield using small quantities of N fertilizers through N mineralization of paddy soil in irrigated rice-based multiple cropping systems were studied in 15 paddy fields in Sichuan Province, China for 3 years. Intensification of vegetable cropping with negative N balance and removal of vegetable crop residues has greatly decreased total N (TN) contents in paddy soil leading to low levels of effective cumulated soil temperature and thickness of plow layer. As a result, the N mineralization in paddy field during paddy rice growing period was decreased. In addition to the low levels of chemical fertilizer N input and residual mineral N input, the lower level of N mineralization in paddy fields and low N recovery efficiency decreased the amount of N accumulated in above-ground biomass of paddy rice at maturity, resulting in limited rice yields. The amount of mineralized N only correlated with TN (partial correlation analysis). Therefore, in paddy fields with very low N input, the N mineralization in paddy soil during the paddy rice-growing period was the major limiting factor affecting the total yield increases. In addition, a decline in soil fertility can be determined using TN as an indicator. To improve paddy rice yield and avoid soil deterioration, the development and adoption of rational soil management programs are needed. These include input of plant residues, conscientious soil tillage for the maintenance of soil temperature and thickness of the plow layer, and the split application of fertilizer for the improvement of N recovery efficiency.

TI  - Stay in shape: Assessing the adaptive potential of shell morphology and its sensitivity to temperature in the invasive New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum through phenotypic plasticity and natural selection in Europe
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Climate change may force organisms to adapt genetically or plastically to new environmental conditions. Invasive species show remarkable potential for rapid adaptation. The ovoviviparous New Zealand mud snail (NZMS), Potamopyrgus antipodarum, has successfully established across Europe with two clonally reproducing mitochondrial lineages since its arrival in the first half of the 19th century. Its remarkable variation in shell morphology was shown to be fitness relevant. We investigated the effects of temperature on shell morphology across 11 populations from Germany and the Iberian Peninsula in a common garden across three temperatures. We analyzed size and shape using geometric morphometrics. For both, we compared reaction norms and estimated heritabilities. For size, the interaction of temperature and haplotype explained about 50% of the total variance. We also observed more genotype by environment interactions indicating a higher degree of population differentiation than in shape. Across the three temperatures, size followed the expectations of the temperature-size rule, with individuals growing larger in cold environments. Changes in shape may have compensated for changes in size affecting space for brooding embryos. Heritability estimates were relatively high. As indicated by the very low coefficients of variation for clonal repeatability (CVA), they can probably not be compared in absolute terms. However, they showed some sensitivity to temperature, in haplotype t more so than in z, which was only found in Portugal. The low CVA values indicate that genetic variation among European populations is still restricted with a low potential to react to selection. A considerable fraction of the genetic variation was due to differences between the clonal lineages. The NZMS has apparently not been long enough in Europe to accumulate significant genetic variation relevant for morphological adaptation. As temperature is obviously not the sole factor influencing shell morphology, their interaction will probably not be a factor limiting population persistence under a warming climate in Europe.

TI  - Interlining Cr(VI) remediation mechanism by a novel bacterium Pseudomonas brenneri isolated from coalmine wastewater
VL  - 233
SP  - 271-282
AB  - A bioremedial approach was investigated on the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution using a novel chromium reducing bacteria isolated from coalmine wastewater. Cr(VI) removal efficacy of the bacterium was determined in a series of batch studies under the influence of various parameters viz., pH (1-7), temperature (20-40 degrees C), initial metal concentration (1-150 mg/L), agitation speed (80-150 rpm) and substrate concentration (1-5 mg/L). Oxygen involvement in the removal process was determined by different incubation conditions. Substrate consumption and its resultant biomass generation were considered for determining the viability of the microbe under varied metal concentration. The microbial isolate survived in Cr(VI) tainted solution with initial concentration of 1-140 mg/L, among which maximum remediation was found in 60 mg/L Cr(VI) loaded solution. The bacterial species also survived in other metal solution viz., Fe(II), As(V), Cu(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Mg(II), Mn(II) apart from Cr(VI). Multiple approaches were tested to facilitate understanding of the bacterial Cr(VI) removal mechanism. The bacteria accumulated metal ions in the exponential growth phase both on and within the cell. Underlying latent factors which governed the bacterial growth and its removal activity was determined with the classical Monod equation. The isolated bacterium also survived in the bimetallic solutions with significant removal of Cr(VI). The microbial species isolated from mining area was identified as Pseudomonas brenneri by 16s rRNA molecular characterization. Hence, the isolated novel bacterium illustrated promising involvement towards bio-treatment of Cr(VI) laden wastewater.

TI  - Different genetic clines in response to temperature across the native and introduced ranges of a global plant invader
VL  - 100
IS  - 3
SP  - 771-781
AB  - 1. Understanding how non-native plants respond to environmental variation, and the limits to these responses, is important for predicting plant invasiveness. Until now, the extent to which species climatic limits differ on introduction to a new range has not been experimentally tested. Here, we investigate fitness responses to temperature and low-temperature limits to reproduction of native and introduced populations of the widespread forb Plantago lanceolata. 2. We recorded fitness parameters of P. lanceolata accessions collected from nearly complete latitudinal gradients in the species' native and introduced ranges and grown in five common gardens arranged along an elevational gradient in the native range (European Alps). The highest garden was located outside the low-temperature limit of the species. 3. Native populations exhibited clear clinal genetic differentiation along temperature gradients, while any differentiation in introduced populations was much weaker; however, the introduced populations displayed higher average fitness and broad climatic tolerance. Despite these differences, both native and introduced plants failed to set seed beyond the elevational range margin and so shared a similar low-temperature limit to reproduction. 4. Synthesis. Our experimental data support observational studies of niche-limit conservatism in non-native plants, which has important implications for their management. Specifically, it suggests that efforts to predict the extent of an invasion based on knowledge of the native niche are likely to be accurate at the level of the species, even if populations undergo genetic changes or respond differently to climatic gradients in the new range.

TI  - Population sex ratios of pleurocerid snails (Leptoxis spp.): Variability and relationships with environmental contaminants and conditions
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 287-298
AB  - Anthropogenic introduction of steroidal estrogens and synthetic estrogenic compounds to aquatic environments has increased interest in assessment of the endocrine-disrupting effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including mollusks. For gonochoristic freshwater snails in the family Pleuroceridae, little is known about the spatial and temporal variation in population sex ratios or potential relationships between sex ratios and exposure to estrogenic compounds. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis (Rafinesque, 1819) spp., were evaluated within the Shenandoah River watershed (Virginia, U.S.A.), where agricultural operations are a source of estrogenic compounds to streams, and in four other river basins in Virginia. Proportions of females varied among streams within the Shenandoah River watershed, with overall mean proportions from four sampling periods ranging from 0.46-0.87. Sex ratios were consistently female-biased at nine of fifteen stream sampling sites. There was little within-site variation across generations of snails or when the same generation was examined in two different seasons. Proportions of females were not directly related to in-stream concentrations of estrogenic compounds or watershed densities of agricultural operations, but were negatively related to mean summer temperature at the sampling sites. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. were female-biased at two of six sites in the Shenandoah River and one of five sites outside the basin. At the river sampling sites, proportions of females were only related to summer-specific conductivity. Overall, results suggest that site-specific factors can affect population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. However, until more is known regarding mechanisms of sex determination and sexual differentiation in gastropods, population sex ratios should not be used as indicators of potential biological effects of estrogenic compounds.

TI  - Temporal trends of the association between extreme temperatures and hospitalisations for schizophrenia in Hefei, China from 2005 to 2014
VL  - 78

SP  - 364-370
AB  - Objective We aimed to examine the temporal trends of the association between extreme temperature and schizophrenia (SCZ) hospitalisations in Hefei, China. Methods We collected time-series data on SCZ hospitalisations for 10 years (2005-2014), with a total of 36 607 cases registered. We used quasi-Poisson regression and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to assess the association between extreme temperature (cold and heat) and SCZ hospitalisations. A time-varying DLNM was then used to explore the temporal trends of the association between extreme temperature and SCZ hospitalisations in different periods. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (0-39 and 40+ years) and gender, respectively. Results We found that extreme cold and heat significantly increased the risk of SCZ hospitalisations (cold: 1st percentile of temperature 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.37) and 2.5th percentile of temperature 1.16 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.31); heat: 97.5th percentile of temperature 1.37 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.66) and 99th percentile of temperature 1.38 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.69)). We found a slightly decreasing trend in heat-related SCZ hospitalisations and a sharp increasing trend in cold effects from 2005 to 2014. However, the risk of heat-related hospitalisation has been rising since 2008. Stratified analyses showed that age and gender had different modification effects on temporal trends. Conclusions The findings highlight that as temperatures rise the body's adaptability to high temperatures may be accompanied by more threats from extreme cold. The burden of cold-related SCZ hospitalisations may increase in the future.

TI  - OBSERVATIONS ON THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE SYMBIONT-BEARING FORAMINIFER AMPHISTEGINA LOBIFERA LARSEN, AN INVASIVE SPECIES IN COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS OF THE AEGEAN SEA (GREECE, E. MEDITERRANEAN)
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 143-150
AB  - Members of the family Amphisteginidae have been nearly ubiquitous contributors to shelf carbonate facies through most of the Cenozoic. The most prolific carbonate producer of modern representatives is Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, which is the largest and shallowest dwelling of the Indo-Pacific taxa. This epiphytic, symbiont-bearing foraminifer is also a remarkably successful invasive species in coastal ecosystems of the eastern Mediterranean, where its shell production is altering the composition of shoreline sediment. This paper reports a temporal study of an A. lobifera population collected monthly between June 2008 May 2009 in the Vravron/Attica coastal ecosystem of the south Evoikos Gulf (Aegean Sea), where winter temperatures can drop below previously reported minima for the species. Monthly variations in size, frequency distribution, and abundance indicate that this population reproduced primarily during the summer (July September), when both asexual and sexual reproduction occurred simultaneously, suggesting a predominantly coeval, one-year life span for each generation. However, a modest increase in juveniles in January indicates some winter reproduction. Comparison of these findings with previous studies shows that a) tolerance of low winter temperatures, b) adaptation of the life cycle to strong seasonality, and c) the mixotrophic feeding strategy have allowed A. lobifera to proliferate in the exceptionally clear, low nutrient, coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea. These attributes elucidate how previous Cenozoic populations of Amphistegina were able to rapidly expand their latitudinal ranges and invade shallow epeiric seas during episodes of climatic warming.

TI  - A novel phosphonium-based deep eutectic catalyst for biodiesel production from industrial low grade crude palm oil
VL  - 92
SP  - 81-88
AB  - This study explores the possibility of producing low grade crude palm oil (LGCPO)-based biodiesel using a two-stage process in which a phosphonium-based deep eutectic solvent (P-DES) and an alkali are used as catalysts. The pre-treatment of LGCPO was conducted using a P-DES composed of a hydrogen bond donor (i.e. p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) and a salt (i.e. allyltriphenylphosphonium bromide) as a novel recyclable catalyst. The P-DES was used in different dosages in the presence of methanol to reduce the level of free fatty acids (FFA) to the acceptable limit for alkaline transesterification reaction. Batch pre-treatment of LGCPO was carried out to study the influence of P-DES dosage (from 0.25 to 3.5% wt/wt). The effects of other operating parameters such as molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time on FFA content reduction, yield of treated LGCPO and FFA to FAME conversion were studied. The P-DES showed high catalytic activity in the pre-treatment of LGCPO. The lab scale investigation proved the viability of esterification and transesterification of oil using P-DES and alkaline catalysts. The biodiesel produced from LGCPO meets the international standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). Three to four times recycling runs of P-DES were achieved without losing its activity. This study introduces a new generation of catalysts for possible batch esterification reaction using P-DES followed by an alkaline transesterification reaction. This study will open a new field for utilizing this strong acid-based DES catalyst for many chemical reactions and industrial applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of circular economies, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are viewed as resource recovery facilities. At the very minimum, the targeted resources are water, biogas, and phosphorus. However, municipal wastewater streams (sludge and effl uent) need to be adequately treated to eliminate the potential for the transmission of microbial pathogens including protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. This paper presents the results from a study demonstrating the use of electron beam technology for sludge hygenization and enhanced methane (biogas) production using municipal wastewater samples. Cogeneration of heat for fertilizer drying and granulation and electricity for powering the electron beam system are also demonstrated.

TI  - A feasibility study of hydrothermal treatment of rice straw for multi-production of solid fuel and liquid fertilizer
VL  - 65
AB  - Energy use has increased steadily over the last century due to population and industry increase. With the growing of GHG, biomass becomes an essential contributor to the world energy need. Indonesia is the third rice producer in the world. Rice straw has been converted to solid fuel by Hydrothermal Treatment (HT) for electricity generation. HT is a boiling solid organic or inorganic substance in water at high pressure and temperature within a holding time. HT converts high moisture content biomass into dried, uniform, pulverized, and higher energy density solid fuels. HT can effectively transport nutrient components in biomass into a liquid product known as fertilizer. This paper deals with an evaluation of hydrothermal treatment of rice straw for solid fuel and liquid fertilizer. An investigation of rice straw characteristics were completed for Bandung rice straw with various condition of temperature, biomass-water ratio, and holding time in the purpose to find the changes of calorific value for solid product and (N, P, K, and pH) for liquid product. The results showed that solid product at 225 degrees C and 90 min consists in a heating value 13.8 MJ/kg equal to lignite B. Liquid product at 225 degrees C and 90 min had the NPK content similar to that of micronutrients compound liquid fertilizer. The dried solid product should be useful for Coal Fire Power Plant, and the liquid product is suitable for plants. This research proves that hydrothermal process can be applied to rice straw to produce solid fuel and liquid fertilizer with adequate quality.

TI  - On the adaptability of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) to the projected change of climate in Germany
VL  - 121
SP  - 130-144
AB  - It has been predicted that in the coming decades the global climate will get warmer and in some regions dryer. Global warming may influence the genetic structure of forest tree populations. This paper presents a simulation study on possible effects of an increasing annual mean temperature and decreasing precipitation during the growing season on the genetic structure characterised by inventories of six isozyme gene loci in provenance trials of Norway spruce (Pirea abies (L.) Karst.). The data for parameterising the model were taken from a trial on 25-year-old Norway spruce. From the data a virtual stand was generated to simulate growth over a period of 75 years at seven sites with varying environmental conditions. The tree growth simulator SILVA 2.2 was run with two scenarios (I. natural mortality only; II. natural mortality and thinning from above). The results of the simulation runs were linked with the isozyme data of the trees as investigated in the trees that were selected for generating the virtual population. In the simulated populations at the age of 100 allele and genotype frequencies were determined. Based on the isozyme data calculations of various measures of genetic multiplicity, heterozygosity, genetic diversity, and genetic differentiation were performed for each simulation run. At the age of 100 years three growth parameters,how large differentiation between sites. Such a separation cannot be found for the genetic parameters as assessed by isozyme gene markers. However, most of the eight genetic parameters differ between sites. Significant differences arc calculated for four genetic parameters in scenario I and for six genetic parameters in scenario II. This result obtained by a new approach, calls for additional studies where more initial populations with different characteristics are tested in various scenarios and with different types of markers.

SP  - 999-1004
AB  - The evolutive cycle of Grapholita molesta (Busck, 1916) was studied on an artificial diet, at constant temperature (20, 23, 26 and 30-degrees-C), relative humidity of 75+ 10% and photofase of 14 hours, with the objective to determine thermal requirements to different phases of development and to predict number of generations per and on peach trees in Pelotas, RS, Brazil. Low threshold temperature and the value of thermal constant in degree-days (DD) were done by using the hyperbole method. Lowest threshold temperatures were 6,47-degrees-C (egg), 9,04-degrees-C (larva), 12,780 (pre-pupa), 6,61-degrees-C (pupa) and 8,99-degrees-C (evolutive cycle). Thermal constants were 64,79 DD (egg), 223,63 DD (larva), 50,16 DD (pre-pupa), 155,46 DD (pupa) and 482,00 DD (evolutive cycle). Based on threshold temperature for the evolutive cycle it was estimated in the above locality that oriental fruit moth should have six to seven generations per year and four to five on peach trees.

VL  - 336

SP  - 1379-1390
AB  - Vertical temperature profiles were recorded from June 1999 to October 2002 (at least once a month) at two Mediterranean sites, in the eastern basin (Batroun, Lebanon; 0-100 m) and in the northwestern basin (Marseilles, France; 0-55 m). At the two sites, the thermal seasonal evolution and the thermocline time dynamics are quite identical. But in the Lebanese waters, at comparable water depths, temperatures are currently 4 to 5 degreesC higher than in the French waters, the thermocline is longer (more than 6 months), permanent and deeper (40-50 m) than in Marseilles (20-30 m). The latter frequently disappears in summer due to northwest winds inducing cold waters. This is principally due to differences in prevailing wind regimes at each site. Such evaluation, coupled with long-term observations of temporal evolution of coastal water at the regional level of the Mediterranean basins, will shed light on temperature regime fluctuations and their consequences in the context of global warming of the Mediterranean.

TI  - Thermal Inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 When Grown Statically or Continuously in a Chemostat
VL  - 73
IS  - 11
SP  - 2018-2024
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if survivor curves for heat-inactivated Escherichia coli O157:H7 were affected by the physiological state of the cells relative to growth conditions and pH of the heating menstruum. A comparison was made between the log-linear model and non-log-linear Weibull approach. Cells were grown statically in aerobic culture tubes or in an aerobic chemostat in tryptic soy broth (pH 7.2). The heating menstruum was unbuffered peptone or phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Thermal inactivation was carried out at 58, 59, 60, and 61 C, and recovery was on a nonselective medium. Longer inactivation times for statically grown cells indicated potential stress adaptation. This was more prevalent at 58 C. Shape response was also significantly different, with statically grown cells exhibiting decreasing thermal resistance over time and chemostat cells showing the opposite effect. Buffering the heating menstruum to ca. pH 7 resulted in inactivation curves that showed less variability or scatter of data points. Time to specific log reduction values (t(d)) for the Weibull model were conservative relative to the log-linear model depending upon the stage of reduction. The Weibull model offered the most accurate fit of the data in all cases, especially considering the log-linear model is equivalent to the Weibull model with a fixed shape factor of 1. The determination of z-value for the log-linear model showed a strong correlation between log D-value and process temperature. Correlations for the Weibull model parameters (log delta and log p) versus process temperature were not statistically significant.

TI  - Reversion mutations in phosphoprotein P of a codon-pair-deoptimized human respiratory syncytial virus confer increased transcription, immunogenicity, and genetic stability without loss of attenuation
VL  - 17
IS  - 12
AB  - Recoding viral genomes by introducing numerous synonymous nucleotide substitutions that create suboptimal codon pairs provides new live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Because recoding typically involves a large number of nucleotide substitutions, the risk of de-attenuation is presumed to be low. However, this has not been thoroughly studied. We previously generated human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in which the NS1, NS2, N, P, M and SH ORFs were codon-pair deoptimized (CPD) by 695 synonymous nucleotide changes (Min A virus). Min A exhibited a global reduction in transcription and protein synthesis, was restricted for replication in vitro and in vivo, and exhibited moderate temperature sensitivity. Here, we show that under selective pressure by serial passage at progressively increasing temperatures, Min A regained replication fitness and lost its temperature sensitivity. Whole-genome deep sequencing identified numerous missense mutations in several genes, in particular ones accumulating between codons 25 and 34 of the phosphoprotein (P), a polymerase cofactor and chaperone. When re-introduced into Min A, these P mutations restored viral transcription to wt level, resulting in increased protein expression and RNA replication. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that these P mutations increased the flexibility of the N-terminal domain of P, which might facilitate its interaction with the nucleoprotein N, and increase the functional efficiency of the RSV transcription/replication complex. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the P mutations on Min A replication and immunogenicity in hamsters. Mutation P[F28V] paradoxically reduced Min A replication but not its immunogenicity. The further addition of one missense mutation each in M and L generated a version of Min A with increased genetic stability. Thus, this study provides further insight into the adaptability of large-scale recoded RNA viruses under selective pressure and identified an improved CPD RSV vaccine candidate. Author summarySynonymous recoding of viral genomes by codon-pair deoptimization (CPD) generates live-attenuated vaccines presumed to be genetically stable due to the high number of nucleotide substitutions. However, their actual genetic stability under selective pressure was largely unknown. In a recoded human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mutant called Min A, six of 11 ORFs were CPD, reducing protein expression and inducing moderate temperature sensitivity and attenuation. When passaged in vitro under selective pressure, Min A lost its temperature-sensitive phenotype and regained fitness by the acquisition of numerous mutations, in particular missense mutations in the viral phosphoprotein (P), a polymerase cofactor and a chaperone for soluble nucleoprotein. These P mutations increased RSV gene transcription globally, thereby increasing RSV protein expression, RNA replication, and virus particle production. Thus, the P mutations increased the efficiency of the RSV transcription/replication complex, compensating for the reduced protein expression due to CPD. In addition, introduction of the P mutations into Min A generated a live-attenuated vaccine candidate with increased genetic stability. Surprisingly, this vaccine candidate exhibited increased attenuation and, paradoxically, exhibited increased immunogenicity per plaque-forming unit in hamsters. This study provides insights into the adaptability of large-scale recoded RNA viruses and identified an improved CPD RSV vaccine candidate.

SP  - 1689-1697
AB  - Methods A generalized linear Poisson regression model was used to regress a time-series of daily mortality for all-cause and selected causes against temperature, controlling for seasonal and interannual variations, day of week and public holidays. A total of 13 270 all-cause deaths excluding external causes for residents under demographic surveillance in Matlab, Bangladesh were available between January 1994 and December 2002. Results There was a marked increase in all-cause deaths and deaths due to cardiovascular, respiratory and perinatal causes at low temperatures over a lag of 013 days. Every 1C decrease in mean temperature was associated with a 3.2 (95 CI 0.95.5) increase in all-cause mortality. However, there was no clear heat effect on all-cause mortality for any of the lags examined. Conclusions This study found that daily mortality increased with low temperatures in the preceding weeks, while there was no association found between high temperatures and daily mortality in rural Bangladesh. Preventive measures during low temperatures should be considered especially for young infants.

TI  - Environmental adaptability and stress tolerance of Laribacter hongkongensis: a genome-wide analysis
VL  - 1
AB  - Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea and it can reside in human, fish, frogs and water. In this study, we performed an in-depth annotation of the genes in its genome related to adaptation to the various environmental niches. Results: L. hongkongensis possessed genes for DNA repair and recombination, basal transcription, alternative sigma-factors and 109 putative transcription factors, allowing DNA repair and global changes in gene expression in response to different environmental stresses. For acid stress, it possessed a urease gene cassette and two arc gene clusters. For alkaline stress, it possessed six CDSs for transporters of the monovalent cation/proton antiporter-2 and NhaC Na+:H+ antiporter families. For heavy metals acquisition and tolerance, it possessed CDSs for iron and nickel transport and efflux pumps for other metals. For temperature stress, it possessed genes related to chaperones and chaperonins, heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins. For osmotic stress, 25 CDSs were observed, mostly related to regulators for potassium ion, proline and glutamate transport. For oxidative and UV light stress, genes for oxidant-resistant dehydratase, superoxide scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, exclusion and export of redox-cycling antibiotics, redox balancing, DNA repair, reduction of disulfide bonds, limitation of iron availability and reduction of iron-sulfur clusters are present. For starvation, it possessed phosphorus and, despite being asaccharolytic, carbon starvation-related CDSs. Conclusions: The L. hongkongensis genome possessed a high variety of genes for adaptation to acid, alkaline, temperature, osmotic, oxidative, UV light and starvation stresses and acquisition of and tolerance to heavy metals.

TI  - Variations in the growth response of Pinus tabulaeformis to a warming climate at the northern limits of its natural range
VL  - 34
IS  - 3
SP  - 707-719
AB  - Key message Higher temperatures are changing the geographical locations in which Pinus tabulaeformis plantations thrive. Future plantations should be located in the warmer, wetter regions of northern China. The adaptability of fragile plantation ecosystems to environmental change, especially in our currently warming climate, has become an important issue. We studied the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis, a tree species endemic to China and widely used in plantations, along a climate-latitude gradient. We established a regional tree ring data network for P. tabulaeformis based on 1340 cores from 28 plantations at the northern limits of its natural range in China and studied the association between the radial growth of the pines and climate factors in a changing environment. Our results show that increasing temperatures have led to changes in the distribution of P. tabulaeformis, with plantations expanding in the southern sub-regions and shrinking in the northern sub-regions. An increase in temperature and the subsequent effect on the availability of water is the most important factor in the different responses of P. tabulaeformis growth to climate change. Relatively wetter regions, such as the southern part of our study area, may be better locations to develop future P. tabulaeformis plantations.

TI  - Lifespan of a Ceratitis fruit fly increases with higher altitude
VL  - 101
IS  - 2
SP  - 345-350
AB  - Variation in lifespan may be linked to geographic factors. Although latitudinal variation in lifespan has been studied for a number of species, altitude variation has received much less attention, particularly in insects. We measured the lifespan of different populations of the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa, along an altitudinal cline. For the different populations, we first measured the residual longevity of wild flies by captive cohort approach and compared the F-1 generation from the same populations. We showed an increase in lifespan with higher altitude for a part of the data obtained. For the field-collected flies (F-0) the average remaining lifespan increased monotonically with altitude for males but not for females. For the F-1 generation, the longevity of both males and females of the highest-altitude population was longer than for the two other lower-altitude populations. This relationship between altitude and lifespan may be explained by the effects of temperature on reproduction. Reproductive schedules in insects are linked to temperature: lower temperature, which is characteristic of high-altitude sites, generally slows down reproduction. Because of a strong trade-off between reproduction and longevity, we therefore observed a longer lifespan for the high-altitude populations. Other hypotheses, such as different predation rates in the different sites, are also discussed. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 101, 345-350.

TI  - Physiological and developmental responses to temperature by the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
VL  - 484
SP  - 115-130
AB  - Environmental temperature and an organism's ability to respond to it are critical determinants of the geographic distribution of species. Nematostella vectensis is a burrowing sea anemone that inhabits estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America from Nova Scotia (45 degrees N) to Georgia (31 degrees N). Like other estuarine species, N. vectensis is exposed to large daily (>20 degrees C) and seasonal (>25 degrees C) fluctuations in temperature, requiring wide temperature tolerances. At the same time, the natural distribution of this species spans a pronounced thermal cline, which may promote the evolution of different temperature optima and tolerances in populations. We tested the thermal tolerance of N. vectensis adult and developmental stages, which showed all life cycle stages had critical temperatures within 1 degrees C (lethal temperature 39.5 to 40.5 degrees C). When temperature tolerance values were compared with recorded field data, N. vectensis is living in environments very close to their physiological limit. We utilized common garden experiments (13, 21, and 29 degrees C) to test for temperature-specific growth and regeneration rates in N. vectensis from different portions of this species' range. Temperature had a significant effect on growth and regeneration rate in all clonal lines, with a significant negative relationship between latitude of origin and growth rate at 29 degrees C. Individuals from higher latitudes did not exhibit higher growth rates at cooler temperatures. Together, our results show a combination of broad thermal tolerances for developmental and adult stages and evidence for local adaptation to higher temperatures in populations living in lower latitude locations that would be physiologically compromised with future warming.

VL  - 3
IS  - 3
SP  - 217-223
AB  - 1 Infestation by the blackcurrant leaf midge Dasineura tetensi and galling incidence on a susceptible (cv. 'Ojebyn') and a moderately resistant (cv. 'Storklas') blackcurrant genotype was studied in the field for two midge generations in the same growing season. On the resistant genotype gall initiation is delayed. 2 The relation between infestation and galling incidence showed considerable variation between the two generations. Galling symptoms produced by the second midge generation were weak on the resistant as compared with the susceptible blackcurrant. 3 Because larval development of that generation coincided with a period of dry and warm weather, it is possible that larvae on the resistant genotype suffered desiccation to a greater extent than larvae on the susceptible genotype where gall development was stronger. 4 The possible interaction of relative humidity and expression of resistance was investigated in controlled environment experiments. The resistant 'Storklas' and a susceptible ('7801-31') currant genotype were studied at two constant relative humidities, 30 and 70%. 5 Larvae of D. tetensi suffered from higher mortality and reduced growth rate on both genotypes in the low humidity environment. 6 There was also a significant plant genotype by humidity interaction on larval performance; no galls were produced and no larvae completed development on the resistant currant at low humidity. 7 There was a trend for a positive correlation between larval length and larval density on a plant at low humidity but not at high humidity.

TI  - Recent developments in pressure retarded osmosis for desalination and power generation
VL  - 138
AB  - When two streams of different salinities are mixed, Gibbs free energy of mixing is released. This energy can be harvested and further converted to electric energy through pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process. Despite several improvements on PRO over the past decades, there still exist several technical issues pertinent to its adequate implementation that remain unresolved. These issues are mainly (i) water transport in the membrane, (ii) membrane material, (iii) fouling, (iv) process efficiency, and (v) techno-economic viability. Different process parameters such as temperature, type of draw solution, feed concentration, and membrane type directly affect the efficiency and power density of PRO. In this review, major trends of PRO (and hybrid plants) are analyzed and the suggested improvements of PRO membranes are discussed. Since potential side-benefits of PRO include electricity production and the treatment of rejected brine from desalination, the process presents a unique path to utilize all these advantages. Therefore, PRO is also coupled with other osmotic, desalination processes to maximize efficiency. The amount of useful energy from PRO would probably be enormous if this was exploited globally. There are several questions remain unanswered about the overall feasibility of PRO as a stand-alone process. This paper offers a comprehensive background and overview on the developments in PRO to enhance its power density and feasibility.

TI  - Indirect Temperatures Measurement in the UCG Process
SP  - 73-78
AB  - The technology of the underground coal gasification (UCG) is still under development and provides alternative for conventional underground mining. UCG is the process, which can be attractive from environmental and economic aspect and is able to have a wide utilization in the future. This technology is less expensive than conventional mining. For research and good analyze of this process there was created the physical model of the gasifier, that simulate the conditions of the real coal-bed in geometric similarity. On created physical model was performed a several experiments represent a various underground conditions. In the gasification process the input is the coal (coal-bed) and oxidizer (mixture of the air and oxygen), which suitable combination provides the best conditions for gasification. One of the expected outputs from the coal gasification process is the high temperature in the coal-bed, which enable running of the chemical reaction needed for the syngas generation. The control of this temperature in the single places of the coal-bed would enable to control behavior of the chemical reactions so the burning queue proceeds. The measurement of the temperatures inside the coal-bed is still complicated because there is the high thermocouples mortality in aggressively hot environment. For this reason is needed to use mathematic - physical apparatus for indirect measurement of these temperatures. In this contribution is presented proposal of the indirect temperature measurement structure in the coal-bed that was verified in the laboratory conditions on the experimental gasifier.

TI  - Migration analysis of Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) from the Philippines to Taiwan under typhoon-induced windy conditions
VL  - 47
IS  - 3
SP  - 263-271
AB  - The population of Nilaparvata lugens (StAyenl) in Taiwan is believed to belong to the East Asian population of the species, which has low susceptibility to the insecticide imidacloprid. The population in the Philippines belongs to the Southeast Asian population, which has high susceptibility to imidacloprid. In this study, long-winged adults of N. lugens collected in paddy fields in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, just after a typhoon, were tested for imidacloprid susceptibility after rearing for 4-17 generations. The migration source was also estimated by backward trajectory analysis. Our findings were, first, that its curved dosage-mortality plots for imidacloprid suggested that the Taitung population is heterogeneous in its susceptibility to the insecticide. Source estimation found areas on Luzon Island of the Philippines, mainly, and southern China, partially, as possible sources. Before the typhoon approached, however, light trap monitoring data indicated some local populations might have occurred in the survey area. Therefore, with other pieces of circumstantial evidence, this study suggested that migration of N. lugens to Taiwan from the Philippines, and, simultaneously, possibly southern China occurred because of the typhoon, with the insects partly crossing the boundary of the Asian populations, and that a mixture of individuals with different susceptibility to the insecticide happened to form the Taitung population at the time of collection.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of commercial heterospermic and homospermic cooled boar semen: Effect of the season, sample type and shipping temperature on sperm quality
VL  - 57
IS  - 4
SP  - 357-367
AB  - We retrospectively analysed data from heterospermic and homospermic boar semen for motility and morphology during a 2-year period. Homospermic doses were also evaluated for viability, acrosome integrity, DNA fragmentation, osmolality and pH. Additionally, we investigated the effect of temperature upon arrival and the agreement between viability and motility as evaluating tool. We observed lower (p < .05) total motility (TM) and normal sperm morphology within summer and fall. Conversely, lower (p < .05) progressive motility (PM) was found at the beginning and end of each year. Viability and acrosome integrity were reduced (p < .05) in summer months but not exclusively, suggesting that samples could be compromised by transport temperature. Sperm DNA fragmentation was <6% with a small variation. Medium osmolality and pH slightly changed (p < .05). Sperm count was not source of variation on sperm parameters. Sample temperature upon arrival correlated with PM and VSL (p < .05), while motility was reduced <12 degrees C (p < .05). Homospermic doses were less affected by season and arrival temperature, having better parameters (p < .05) than contemporaneous heterospermic samples but influenced by genetic line (p < .05). We found a high agreement between viable acrosome-intact sperm and TM, especially when TM was >= 80%. Our data verify the improvement of sperm quality during time as sperm count/dose does not affect quality, but season effect persists regardless of ejaculate selection at the stud. Homospermic doses exhibited better parameters than heterospermic doses, seemingly being more resilient to temperature variations, suggesting that selection for sperm quality within boars selected by growth traits can improve the product quality.

TI  - Temperature and heat wave trends in northwest Mexico
VL  - 91
SP  - 20-26
AB  - Increase in temperature extremes is one of the main expected impacts of climate change, as well as one of the first signs of its occurrence. Nevertheless, results emerging from General Circulation Models, while sufficient for large scales, are not enough for forecasting local trends and, hence, the IPCC has called for local studies based on on-site data. Indeed, it is expected that climate extremes will be detected much earlier than changes in climate averages. Heat waves are among the most important and least studied climate extremes, however its occurrence has been only barely studied and even its very definition remains controversial. This paper discusses the observed changes in temperature trends and heat waves in Northwestern Mexico, one of the most vulnerable regions of the country. The climate records in two locations of the region are analyzed, including one of the cities with extreme climate in Mexico, Mexicali City in the state of Baja California and the Yaqui River basin at Sonora State using three different methodologies. Results showed clear trends on temperature increase and occurrence of heat waves in both of the study zones using the three methodologies proposed. As result, some policy making suggestion are included in order to increase the adaptability of the studied regions to climate change, particularly related with heat wave occurrence.

TI  - A multi-model method to assess the value of power-to-gas using excess renewable
VL  - 47
IS  - 15
SP  - 9103-9114
AB  - Power-to-Gas (P2G) is a process that produces a gas from electricity, which is most commonly hydrogen via electrolysis. While some studies have considered hydrogen as a power-to-power storage vector, it could also be used as a fuel across the energy system, for example for transport or heat generation. Here, two energy models are used to explore the potential contribution of P2G as a cost-effective source of hydrogen, particularly for future energy systems with high variable renewable energy (VRE) in which there are occasional periods when electricity supply exceeds demand. A detailed electricity system model is iterated with a multi-vector energy system model using a soft-linking approach. This iterative approach addresses shortcomings in each model to better understand the optimal capacity of P2G and the potential economic capture rate of excess VRE. The modelling method is applied to Great Britain in 2050 as a case study. A substantial proportion of excess VRE in 2050 can be captured by P2G, and it is economically competitive compared with alternative sources. Moreover, the effectiveness and economic viability of P2G for reducing excess renewable is robust at even very high levels of renewable penetration. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

VL  - 26

SP  - 744-748
AB  - The intensive nse of mineral coal for thermal power generation is known to cause severe damage to the regional environment. The emission of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and fluoride (F) compounds into the atmosphere may lead, under certain conditions, to serious contamination of primary matrices in the biosphere and even of foodstuffs. In the present study, egg samples were collected from nonconfined hens (Gallus domesticus) over a period of 2 yr in the vicinity of two of the major coal power plants (Candiota and Charqueadas) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The constituent parts of the samples (yolk, albumen, and shell) were solubilized with acid in a tenon-lined pressurized bomb after an appropriate heating step. The Cd and Pb were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry using Pd/Mg nitric solution as chemical modifier. Fluoride was determined by direct ion-selective electrode potentiometry. Cadmium concentration in the samples from both regions ranged from <0.01 (albumen) to 0.10 (yolk) mg kg(-1) whereas Pb and F concentrations ranged from 0.16 (shell) to 3.16 (yolk) and from 0.06 (yolk) to 1.75 (shell) mg kg(-1) respectively. A comparison with the higher obtained mean values for reference samples (Cd < 0.02 mg kg(-1), shell; Pb = 0.11 mg kg(-1), yolk; and F = 0.07 mg kg(-1), shell) indicates a significant environmental contamination with Pb and F in the regions of Candiota and Charqueadas. A relative Cd and Pb enrichment in the yolk was also confirmed, whereas F preferentially concentrated in the shell.

VL  - 85

SP  - 875-884
AB  - Environmental temperature is an important factor that regulates activity and physiological processes of ectotherms. Because sympatric species are exposed to similar thermal niche conditions, closely related species could present similar thermal requirements. This similarity may generate interspecific competition for optimal thermal space. The thermal ecology of the sympatric viviparous lizards Sceloporus lineolateralis and S. poinsettii (Sceloporus torquatus and Sceloporus poinsettii groups, respectively) were studied in natural populations in Penon Blanco, Durango, Mexico. We found that active body temperatures and selected body temperatures were similar among species. However, S. poinsettii exhibited higher efficiency and accuracy of thermoregulation because the preferred thermal range of this species was wider. Finally their thermal preferences are analogous to those previously reported for the both groups and the genus.

TI  - High percentages of larval tetraploids in the yellowtail tetra Astyanax altiparanae induced by heat-shock: The first case in Neotropical characins
VL  - 520
AB  - Tetraploid fish are an important source of diploid gametes for polyploid production, and they can be induced by inhibition of the first mitotic cell division. Dispite its potential, very few protocols regarding tetraploidization and subsequent application to mass production of triploid fish for aquaculture exist. In the yellowtail tetra Astyanax altiparanae, triploids present sterility and increased carcass yield, suggesting the generation of tetraploid for large-scale production of such triploids. In this study, the efficacy of heat shock treatments (40 degrees for 2 min) at 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and 26 min post-fertilization (mpf) at an incubation temperature of 22 degrees C were compared on tetraploid induction of A. altiparanae. Ploidy status was confirmed by flow cytometry, karyotyping, and nuclear diameter of erythrocytes. Afterwards, sperm parameters and fertility capacity of tetraploid males were evaluated. The results showed that heat shock decreased the hatching rate, especially at 22 (19.1 +/- 9.6%), 24 (16.0 +/- 9.1%), and 26 mpf (10.3 +/- 6.2%) in comparison with the control group (62.2 +/- 7.7%). The flow cytometric analysis showed that the control group and the treatments with heat shock at 16 and 18 mpf presented only diploid individuals. However, from 20 mpf onwards, tetraploid individuals were observed, and the highest percentage arose at 26 mpf (94.55%). When mature, tetraploid males are capable of producing diploid spermatozoa with fertilization capacity, generating a 100% triploid offspring. The results indicate that the heat shock treatment at 26 mpf (40 degrees C for 2 min) is optimum for tetraploid induction in the A. altiparanae. Additionally, tetraploid mature males generated diploid spermatozoa and can be used to mass production of triploid fish. The current data are the first report of tetraploids in family Characidae, presenting an application in basic and applied sciences.

TI  - Development and Application of Efficient Oil Displacement System for Middle-Low Permeability and High Pour-Point Heavy Oil Reservoirs
VL  - 2021
AB  - In view of the problems of low permeability, high oil viscosity and freezing point, and low productivity of single well in Luo 321 and Luo 36 blocks of Luojia Oilfield, the chemical viscosity-reducing cold production technology was studied. By analyzing the properties of crude oil, it is concluded that the reason for high viscosity and high freezing point is the high content of asphaltene, pectin, and wax. The viscosity is mainly affected by asphaltene; the wax precipitation point and pour point are mainly affected by the wax; and the solidification point is affected by the wax and asphaltene. The treatment idea of reducing viscosity and inhibiting wax is determined. By compounding the synthetic pour point depressant POA-VA and the viscosity reducer DBD-DOPAMA, the effect of reducing the viscosity and freezing point of crude oil was evaluated. PD-7 (POA-VA 40%, DBD-DOPAMA 50%, and P-10C 10%) system was selected as the optimal formula. When the concentration of the system is 10%, the viscosity reduction rate reaches 95.2%; the freezing point can reduce by 10.2 degrees C; it has good oil sample adaptability, salinity resistance, and temperature resistance; and the oil washing rate can reach more than 60%. The oil displacement system was injected into the formation by means of multiconcentration and multislug and was applied in the field of Luo 321-2 Well. A total of 500t of the oil displacement system was injected, and the effect of measures lasted for 400 days, with a cumulative oil increase of 883t. It has been applied in different blocks 30 times and achieved a good field application effect.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate. the positive effects of compost application in agriculture and the benefit of the composting process for solid-waste treatment in the Mekong Delta region in southern Vietnam (comprised of 12 provinces and 1 centrally city). A simple prediction model for waste generation based on population and employing time-series analysis was constructed to assess and forecast waste generation to identify the potential of waste for composting and discharging. The greenhouse gas baseline emission from biodegradable components and the greenhouse gas reduction emission for alternative composting options were also calculated in g(CO2 eq.) per capita per day. Scenarios regarding different composting applications for the Mekong Delta region were defined. The estimations focused on such matters as environmental impacts, greenhouse-gas emission and reduction, resource consumption, economic benefits, and the application potential of the composting process. The principal result was that organic-waste composting was beneficial not only for mitigating the waste burden in landfill sites but also for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions compared to baseline emission and the attendant costs. In addition, the compost product was identified as having strong potential to displace chemical fertilizers in agriculture. It was shown that the composting process was a sound alternative for moving toward sustainable development in waste treatment and agriculture.

TI  - Experimental test for adaptive differentiation of ginseng populations reveals complex response to temperature
VL  - 110
IS  - 4
SP  - 829-837
AB  - Local climatic adaptation can influence species response to climate change. If populations within a species are adapted to local climate, directional change away from mean climatic conditions may negatively affect fitness of populations throughout the species range. Adaptive differentiation to temperature was tested for in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) by reciprocally transplanting individuals from two populations, originating at different elevations, among temperature treatments in a controlled growth chamber environment. Fitness-related traits were measured in order to test for a population temperature treatment interaction, and key physiological and phenological traits were measured to explain population differences in response to temperature. Response to temperature treatments differed between populations, suggesting genetic differentiation of populations. However, the pattern of response of fitness-related variables generally did not suggest ohome temperature' advantage, as would be expected if populations were locally adapted to temperature alone. Failure consistently to detect a ohome temperature' advantage response suggests that adaptation to temperature is complex, and environmental and biotic factors that naturally covary with temperature in the field may be critical to understanding the nature of adaptation to temperature.

VL  - 25

SP  - 699-716
AB  - Earth mites are pests of crops and pastures in southeastern Australia. Recent studies show differences between earth mite species in their mode of reproduction, preferred hosts and pesticide tolerance. This paper examines the distribution and pest status of each species. The southeastern Australian distribution for each species is mapped, incorporating new data from eastern New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. A new population of an undescribed species previously identified from northwestern Victoria was found in northern New South Wales. CLIMEX was used to identify climatic factors limiting the distribution of P. major and P. falcatus, the most broadly distributed species. This analysis suggests tolerance to heat and desiccation limits the inland distribution of these two species. A three-year survey of agricultural outbreaks indicates that all Penthaleus species are major agricultural pests although their pest status on crop types appears to differ. All species contributed to chemical control failures. However P. falcatus, previously identified in laboratory tests as having increased tolerance to pesticides, was the most common species associated with control failures. A laboratory experiment indicated that mites are sometimes pests on crops on which they cannot persist for a generation. Results are discussed with respect to management of these agricultural pests.

VL  - 32

SP  - 45-66
AB  - This is a conceptual study, for MW to GW scale, comparing production, transmission, and storage costs for gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels made from wind-generated electricity, with and without the low-cost, annual-scale, firming storage which would add great market and strategic value. Both fuels are suitable for vehicles and for distributed generation (DG) in stationary combined-heatand-power (CHP),via fuel cells or internal combustion engines (ICE's). NH3 is also a valuable fertilizer, and this study briefly examines the economics of renewable-source versus fossil-source production of NH3 fertilizer. No pilot plant exists for confirming the system capital costs and conversion efficiencies we estimate in this study, although both GH2 and NH3 have been proposed for wind energy transmission and storage [1-6]. Hydrogen is promising as a clean-burning energy carrier, and modern electrolyzers can produce large volumes of high-pressure hydrogen, ready for direct pipeline transmission and/or for ammonia synthesis, from renewable energy sources. Renewable-source hydrogen can alternatively be stored and transported as NH3, which can be readily synthesized, following electrolysis, using atmospheric nitrogen, and be used at the delivery end-point as a fertilizer or a fuel. Both GH2 and NH3 transmission and firming storage will accelerate our conversion from fossil to diverse renewable resources, via major new markets including, and beyond, the electricity sector.

TI  - IMPROVEMENT OF FLOW CONDITIONS FOR THE STAGES SUBSEQUENT TO EXTRACTION MODULES IN INDUSTRIAL STEAM TURBINES
AB  - Industrial steam turbines are applied for power generation as well as drive for turbo-compressors. They combine a high level of operational flexibility with highest reliability. Especially in the field of process technology they provide process heat on a certain enthalpy level for other industrial applications. Modular design concepts are used to meet these various requirements like admission or extraction of large steam quantities. Extraction modules use valves to control the amount of steam extracted from the turbine expansion path at constant steam parameters. While extraction steam is taken from the turbine through an outlet flange, the remaining steam passes valves and downstream diffusers, flows into an annular inner casing and finally escapes through the subsequent stages. Depending on the valve lift, different flow separations can occur around the valves, resulting in unsteady transonic jets. Due to the compact and asymmetric design of the inner casing the flow into the subsequent stages is strongly disturbed. Hence, strong unsteady mechanical blade loading can occur in addition to efficiency loss. The current work focusses on the improvement of the flow conditions in the subsequent stage. Experimental results are applied to quantify the viability of the used 3D RANS CFD-solver (ANSYS CFX 14) for these numerical investigations. Compared with the experiment, the distribution of pressure, velocity and incidence angle are well predicted by the numerical code. It is evident that the unsteady transonic jets emerging around the valves have a major influence on the distribution of the parameters considered. Thus, to quantify the impact of a modified inlet chamber design, it is sufficient to simulate the domain starting from the valves. The influence of different design modifications on the flow parameters in comparison with the base design is discussed in detail in an extensive study. The results clarify that horizontal and vertical valve positions, as well as thorough contouring of the radial-axial deflection have a strong influence on the distribution of pressure, mass flux and incidence angle. Hence, in this contribution combinations of the most beneficial modifications are investigated numerically and compared with the base design.

VL  - 163
IS  - 12
SP  - D3076-D3079
AB  - Secondary batteries based on lithium (Li) metal anodes are a potential candidate for next-generation energy storage devices, but their practical commercialization has so far been greatly limited by safety issues and cycle-life limitations associated with the formation of Li dendrites. This study therefore looks at the morphology of Li that is electrodeposited in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) with a view to determining the most suitable electrolyte properties. Particular focus is given to how the distribution of nucleation points changes in relation to the charge transfer resistance of the RTIL, which is varied by changing the viscosity of the electrolyte. Through this, it is found that a more viscous electrolyte with a higher charge transfer resistance produces Li deposits that are more evenly distributed and smaller in size. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - Enhancement of fuel cell performance of sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) membrane using different crosslinkers
VL  - 566
SP  - 383-395
AB  - Fuel cells are considered as clean and efficient devices for the generation of electric power. The commercial viability of proton exchange membrane fuel cell largely depends on membrane properties. Thus, this paper emphasizes on the preparation of crosslinked sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) membranes and their evaluation for fuel cell application. Initially, the copolymer was synthesized using phenolphthalein monomer, potassium 2,5-dihydroxybenzenesulfonate and 4,4'-diflorobenzophenone. To improve the fuel cell performance, the copolymer was crosslinked with different mass% of polystyrene sulfonic acid-co-maleic acid sodium salt (PSSA-MA) and sulphothalic acid (SPTA). The physico-chemical properties of the resulting membranes were studied using various techniques. The microstructure of the membranes was examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The oxidative stability was performed in Fenton's solution at 80 degrees C and indicated that more than 92% of the membrane residue remained with a minimum loss of ion exchange capacity (IEC). The proton conductivity was investigated in fully hydrated state, which revealed that the proton conductivity of both the series of crosslinked membranes was increased with increasing the content of PSSA-MA and SPTA up to 20 mass%. Among the series, 20 mass% of PSSA-MA and SPTA incorporated crosslinked membranes exhibited the highest IEC values of 2.569 and 2.342 meq g(-1), respectively. Similarly, the proton conductivity of PSSA-MA and SPTA crosslinked membrane was found to be 0.134 and 0.117 S cm(-1) M 80 degrees C with 100% relative humidity. The performance of fuel cell study revealed that 20 mass% of PSSA-MA and SPTA crosslinked membranes demonstrated an excellent power density of 0.45 W cm(-2) at 0.82 A cm(-2) and 0.42 W cm(-2) at 0.71 A cm(-2), respectively. Thus, these two crosslinked membranes developed here could be used as promising candidates for fuel cell applications.

SP  - 1067-1072
AB  - The mean selected temperature (MST), determined from 27, 7 mo old snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in an aquatic thermal gradient, was 29.8 +/- 0.4 C. We investigated the effects of nutritional status and the location of initial placement in the thermal gradient on the selection of MST. The effects of nutritional status were determined by assigning hatchlings to three different feeding treatments (satiated, 5 d, and 10 d without food), whereas the effect of initial position in the thermal gradient was investigated by placing the turtles at either end or in the middle of the gradient. Analysis of variance combined with the method of orthogonal polynomials showed a significant interaction between nutritional status and initial position. Subsequent simple effects analysis indicated that satiated hatchlings places in the coldest compartment of the gradient were the only group to demonstrate significant differences: they occupied a cooler MST (26.5 +/- 0.9 C) than did any other groups. We conclude, therefore, that hatchling snapping turtles do not exhibit a thermophilic response associated with feeding, and that nutritional status affects MST only because satiated animals tend to be more sedentary.

TI  - Coordination between anti-inflammation and antitumor actions for systematic tumor treatments with improved prognosis
VL  - 439
AB  - Tumor relapse and cancerometastasis frequently occur post tumor treatments, leading to poor prognosis with high mortality. Unfortunately, therapy-exacerbated inflammation is among the chief causes of poor prognosis, especially for photothermal therapy (PTT). To overcome this mismatch between therapy and prognosis, we design a built-in Pt/polydopamine(PDA) nanoconstruction (PNP) that makes the anti-inflammation potency and therapy outcome positively inter-linked by virtue of their temperature dependency. PDA not only works as the PTT agent but also provides a self-reductive nano-substrate (-150 nm) for the in-situ generation of ultrasmall Pt nanodots (-4 nm). The embedding of Pt nanodots affects insignificantly the PTT potency of PDA while importing the enzyme-like ROS-scavenging function to defend inflammation in a therapy-enhanced manner. Specifically, PNP exhibits the increasing anti-inflammation effect with the elevated temperature caused by PTT, which enables the anti-inflammation pathway to match perfectly PTT modality. In vivo results indicate that PNP leads to better antitumor performance and effective inhibition of tumor relapse and cancerometastasis. This study provides new ideas for systematical tumor treatments with improved prognosis by coordinating anti-inflammation and antitumor actions harmoniously.

SP  - 413-417
AB  - In the period 1996-1999 field trial was performed in Obory near Kwidzyn on heavy textured Fluvisols. The experiment was aimed to determine yield, chemical composition, heat value of wood of six genotypes of willow coppice in relation to cutting frequency and on determining the costs and profitability of willow production on arable land for purposes of energy generation. Yield of wood dry matter in one-year cutting cycle amounted to 14.09 t.ha(-1).year(-1) and significantly increased to 16.05 and 21.55 t.ha(-1).year(-1) when harvesting was performed in two and three years cycle, respectively. The highest yield was found for Salix viminalis 082 form cut in three years cycle and it amounted to 26.44 t.ha(-1).year(-1). Stems of Salix sp. cut every three years showed the lowest water content (46.05%), high heat value 19.56 MJ.kg(-1) dry matter and the highest content of cellulose (55.94%), lignins (13.79%) and hemicelluloses (13.96%). High yielding potential of Salix sp. and high content of cellulose and lignin in wood make this crop very prosperous as a feedstock for bioenergy production. The highest profit from the willow plantation was obtained in case of harvest every three years at 578.76 EUR.ha(-1).year(-1).

TI  - Proteogenomic Analysis of Epibacterium Mobile BBCC367, a Relevant Marine Bacterium Isolated From the South Pacific Ocean
VL  - 9
AB  - Epibacterium mobile BBCC367 is a marine bacterium that is common in coastal areas. It belongs to the Roseobacter Glade, a widespread group in pelagic marine ecosystems. Species of the Roseobacter Glade are regularly used as models to understand the evolution and physiological adaptability of generalist bacteria. E. mobile BBCC367 comprises two chromosomes and two plasmids. We used gel-free shotgun proteomics to assess its protein expression under 16 different conditions, including stress factors such as elevated temperature, nutrient limitation, high metal concentration, and UVB exposure. Comparison of the different conditions allowed us not only to retrieve almost 70% of the predicted proteins, but also to define three main protein assemblages: 584 essential core proteins, 2,144 facultative accessory proteins and 355 specific unique proteins. While the core proteome mainly exhibited proteins involved in essential functions to sustain life such as DNA, amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors, vitamins and lipids metabolisms, the accessory and unique proteomes revealed a more specific adaptation with the expression of stress-related proteins, such as DNA repair proteins (accessory proteome), transcription regulators and a significant predominance of transporters (unique proteome). Our study provides insights into how E. mobile BBCC367 adapts to environmental changes and copes with diverse stresses.

VL  - 197

SP  - 869-875
AB  - Temperate-zone ectotherms experience varying or very low ambient temperatures and may have difficulty in attaining preferred body temperatures. Thus, adaptations to reduce the thermal dependence of physiological processes may be present. We measured the optimal temperature range for sprint speed and compared it with the selected body temperatures (T (sel)) of two sympatric, cool-temperate lizards: the diurnal skink Oligosoma maccanni and the primarily nocturnal gecko Woodworthia (previously Hoplodactylus) "Otago/Southland". We also investigated whether time-of-day influenced sprint speed. Contrary to results for other reptiles, we found that time-of-day did not influence speed in either species. For each species, the optimal temperature range for sprinting and T (sel) overlapped, supporting the 'thermal coadaptation' hypothesis. However, the optimal range of temperatures for speed is not always attainable during activity by either species, which have limited opportunities to attain T (sel) in the field. The thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in these two species does not appear to have evolved to fully match their current thermal environment. More data on cold-adapted species are needed to fully understand physiological adaptation in ectotherms.

TI  - Cold-trapped organic compounds at the poles of the Moon and Mercury: Implications for origins
VL  - 36
AB  - We have calculated evaporation rates for a range of organic compounds that may be cold-trapped at the poles of the Moon and Mercury. Organics vary widely in their volatilities and thus can be stable to evaporation at higher and lower temperatures than water. The detection of cold-trapped organics would point to volatile delivery by impacts, as comets and asteroids are the only plausible sources for organic molecules. The characterization of cold-trapped organics on both bodies may provide constraints on the thermal evolution of cold traps over time and the history of volatiles in the inner solar system.

TI  - A partly stage-structured model for the abundance of salmon lice in salmonid farms
VL  - 26
SP  - 9-22
AB  - The parasitic salmon louse constrains growth in the Norwegian salmon farming industry through density dependent host-parasite interaction. Hence, there is a need for insight into how increases in salmon production, varying spatial organisation of the production and pest control strategies affect salmon louse population dynamics. Here we present a new salmon louse model for exploring effects of varying salmon farming conditions on spatio-temporal abundances of the parasite. The salmon louse model is partly stage-structured, comprising of (i) adult female lice and (ii) other mobile stages of lice. The abundance of adult females depend on survival of females from previous weeks and recruitment from the other mobile group of lice. The other mobiles also depend on survival of other mobiles from previous weeks, as well as recruitment from the previous generation of reproducing adult females from the same farm or from farms in the neighbourhood. In addition, expected abundances of the two stage-groups are modelled as functions of biological and physical covariates. The model is fitted to weekly salmon farm data covering all marine farms producing salmonids along the Norwegian cost over the years 2012-2016. Among novel results from fitting the model are estimates of the time-lag structure representing recruitment of other mobile lice from the previous generation adult females for different temperatures. Furthermore, the model estimates how various factors affect the susceptibility of fish on farms to louse infection and effects of treatments to control infection. Finally, the model estimates density dependent effects of increasing the number of fish in farms and of increasing the numbers of farms, on the rate of recruitment of other mobile lice. Analytically, the parameters representing density dependencies suggest that few farms with many fish and large between farm distances is effective in terms of minimising the overall output of salmon lice infection.

TI  - From egg to maturity: a closed system for complete life cycle studies of the holopelagic jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca
VL  - 41

SP  - 207-217
AB  - Despite its wide spatial distribution and its high abundance in the Mediterranean Sea, the biology and the ecology of the scyphozoan species Pelagia noctiluca remain poorly understood. This is mainly due to difficulties related to sampling and its maintenance in laboratory conditions. Thus, only a few studies exist on the ecophysiology of this jellyfish species under laboratory conditions. As an example, the maximum sizes of individuals obtained in previous culturing systems were not comparable to the ones found in the environment and the authors could not obtain a second generation. Here we present an improved rearing system for P. noctiluca employing a new enclosed system running with artificial seawater. The monitoring of the jellyfish in this new system highlights the importance of the quality of the food sources provided to the cultures, as well as the volume available for jellyfish growth. We obtain adults similar in size to the ones found in the open ocean (> 11 cm), and we were able to obtain a second generation, 140 days after the first one. Our system is both less time-consuming and less stressful for the jellyfish.

TI  - Climatic variation affects clutch phenology in Agassiz's desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-74
AB  - There is concern about how climate change might affect Agassiz's desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii, a threatened species. We studied the effects of climatic variation on clutch phenology of a population at a wind energy generation facility for 7 field seasons between 1997 and 2011. Using X-radiography, we quantified the following phenophases based on the number of calendar days to each event from 1 January: appearance and disappearance of 65 first and 53 second clutches, and inter-clutch intervals between first and second clutches. Although third clutches were rare (n = 8), they were observed in 5 of 7 yr and were produced by 8 different females, all of which produced a third clutch only once during the study. Shelled eggs were visible from as early as 11 April to as late as 28 July, and the overall time span that eggs were visible differed among years. After controlling for maternal effects, we observed statistically significant inter-annual variation in all phenophases except for inter-clutch interval. Clutch appearance was late in cool years relative to warm years and especially late after 2 consecutive cool years. Using degree day (DD) methodology, we calculated DD accumulation during the post-hibernation and nesting season for each year. We then used DD estimates for mean date of first clutch appearance to predict the mean date of first clutch appearance in subsequent years with 1 to 10 d accuracy for all but 1 yr (1998) with El Nino conditions. Clutch phenology appears to be correlated with inter-annual variation in climate and may be influenced by climatic events in previous years.

TI  - GENETIC AND ONTOGENIC VARIATION IN BEHAVIOR - ITS POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC-VARIATION IN THE WING DIMORPHISM OF GRYLLUS-FIRMUS
VL  - 71
SP  - 481-487
AB  - Genetic variation may be preserved in populations by several different modes of behaviour. In this paper we examine the consequences of behaviour on genetic variation in traits that are determined by genetic factors and by environmental conditions experienced during ontogeny. The particular trait considered is wing dimorphism in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. In this species, as is typical of wing dimorphic insects, the adult wing morph (macropterous or micropterous) is determined by both genetic constitution and the temperature experienced during a specific period of nymphal development. Wing morph may thus be controlled, in part, by the thermal preference of nymphs. The effective heritability of wing morphology will be increased if nymphs with a genetic disposition to a particular wing morph select the temperature that causes that morph to be expressed. By contrast, effective heritability will be decreased if nymphs show no preference, or nymphs select temperatures that reduce phenotypic variation among individuals. During the period of ontogeny when future wing morph is sensitive to temperature, nymphal crickets that are genetically disposed to become macropterous select lower temperatures than crickets that have the opposite genetic disposition. Likewise, nymphs that are being raised under conditions promoting macroptery select lower temperatures than nymphs being raised under conditions favouring microptery. The consequence of this behaviour is that genetic variation for wing morph may be masked, and hence preserved.

VL  - 48

AB  - With a high surface to volume ratio, small organisms must carefully regulate their internal water status. Spottedwing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is an invasive frugivorous insect distributed across a wide range of geographical regions that can have periods of dry and hot weather, suggesting that this species has strategies to avoid stressful environments and reduce water loss. It also survives winter as an adult fly, indicating that it has adaptations to the low air humidity of this season. To determine the importance of water stress to D. suzukii, we studied their survival in environments of low humidity, which was manipulated using Drierite, and their survival and water loss in response to desiccation. Survival of both sexes was lower in drier conditions, and while female winter morph D. suzukii had higher mortality early on, remaining flies were able to survive longer in the drier conditions than the summer morphs. A bioassay method was adapted from Enjin et al. (2016) using 48-well plates to videotape the location of flies and quantify their behavioral responses to humidity. Male and female D. suzukii avoided dry conditions within the bioassay system, but only when there was at least 26% differential between humidity extremes. This response was observed for both summer and winter morphs of D. suzukii and our results provide guidance for attempts to manipulate crop environments to reduce the economic impact of this pest.

TI  - Gene by environmental interactions affecting oxidative phosphorylation and thermal sensitivity
VL  - 311
IS  - 1
SP  - R157-R165
AB  - The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway is responsible for most aerobic ATP production and is the only metabolic pathway with proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In studies examining mitonuclear interactions among distant populations within a species or across species, the interactions between these two genomes can affect metabolism, growth, and fitness, depending on the environment. However, there is little data on whether these interactions impact natural populations within a single species. In an admixed Fundulus heteroclitus population with northern and southern mitochondrial haplotypes, there are significant differences in allele frequencies associated with mitochondrial haplotype. In this study, we investigate how mitochondrial haplotype and any associated nuclear differences affect six OxPhos parameters within a population. The data demonstrate significant OxPhos functional differences between the two mitochondrial genotypes. These differences are most apparent when individuals are acclimated to high temperatures with the southern mitochondrial genotype having a large acute response and the northern mitochondrial genotype having little, if any acute response. Furthermore, acute temperature effects and the relative contribution of Complex I and II depend on acclimation temperature: when individuals are acclimated to 12 degrees C, the relative contribution of Complex I increases with higher acute temperatures, whereas at 28 degrees C acclimation, the relative contribution of Complex I is unaffected by acute temperature change. These data demonstrate a complex gene by environmental interaction affecting the OxPhos pathway.

VL  - 27
IS  - 6
AB  - The evolution of laser-induced plasma for an aluminum target in a helium ambient gas at different pressures of 100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 mbar is numerically studied. A thermal model of laser ablation is utilized for calculation of plasma parameters which comprise heat conduction, Euler equations, Saha-Eggert equations, Knudsen layer boundary condition, mass and energy balance relations, and optical shielding effects. In addition, in order to determine the temporal parameters of aluminum's plasma, the hydrodynamic equations are computed for calculation of the plasma absorption due to inverse Bremsstrahlung and photoionization. A CO2 laser pulse at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m with different pulse durations of 50 and 100ns is irradiated on laser induced Al plasma for truncation of the transmitted CO2 laser pulse. The laser intensities irradiated on the Al sample for producing plasma and generation of a shortened pulse are considered as 10(16), 10(17), and 5x10(17) W/m(2). Furthermore, for validation of the theoretical calculations, some experimental results are presented. Results showed that higher helium gas pressures caused the critical density attained at earlier delay times which caused the CO2 laser beam became efficiently truncated. Moreover, it is concluded that pulse duration has an inverse relation with ambient gas pressure and laser intensity which means that the higher gas pressure or laser intensity induces less pulse duration.

VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-218
AB  - Climate models predict that the atmospheric CO2 concentration will double and atmospheric temperatures will increase 1.8-4.0 degrees C globally by the end of this century. These changes will influence the growth of both crop plants and herbivores. The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on maize, Zea mays L., were examined in environmentally controlled chambers. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves. Developmental time of larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and the entire immature development of T. urticae was reduced at elevated temperatures, while elevated CO2 slightly mitigated the effects of elevated temperature on developmental time. The fecundity of T. urticae declined under elevated CO2 and temperature. Tetranychus urticae had lower net reproductive rate and shorter generation time at elevated temperatures, regardless of CO2 level. These results indicate that elevated CO2-mediated decrease in nutritional quality of maize leaves extends the development time of T. urticae. Taken together, with the increase of CO2 and temperature, the growth and development was accelerated for T. urticae feeding on maize, but its fecundity declined, which will decrease the T. urticae damage to maize for each generation. However, the number of generations will increase in high accumulative temperature regions, which may exacerbate T. urticae damage to maize. Thus, more integrated studies and realistic experimental designs are needed to predict the maize-T. urticae interaction under future climate change scenarios.

VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 49-55
AB  - In this study, an experimental protocol has been developed for comparing survival rates of mutant and wild-type zebrafish larvae under extreme starvation. Zebrafish larvae were placed in 96-well plates at fourth day postfertilization (dpf) and larvae were not fed at all from hatching to cease. Zdf1 zebrafish line was used, a strain carrying the (cancer) pathogenic TP53-M214K amino acid substitution. TP53-M214 corresponds to the human TP53-M246 and both residues are located on the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein. Survival statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the overall survival rates between homozygous mutant and wild-type larvae. When considering 15 dpf as the endpoint of the experiment (66% of larvae died), a borderline statistical significance was observed for the dominant model of inheritance (p = 0.015; relative hazard = 0.8320). Despite the fact yolk sac of larvae is depleted at 7-8 dpf, 34% of larvae survive until 15 dpf and 1.5% until 17 dpf. Concluding, three main results derive from this study: (1) pathogenic homozygous mutations in TP53 probably do not alter survival rates of zebrafish larvae under starvation; (2) zebrafish larvae can live up to 17 dpf without food, surviving only with their initial nutritional supplies; and (3) an easy and affordable protocol has been developed for estimating survival rates of zebrafish larvae under stressful conditions.

TI  - SELECTED BODY TEMPERATURE AND THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR IN THE SIT-AND-WAIT FORAGING LIZARD PSEUDOCORDYLUS MELANOTUS MELANOTUS
VL  - 23
SP  - 108-122
AB  - We investigated the thermoregulatory abilities and behaviour of Pseudocordylus melanotus melanotus (Drakensberg crag lizard) in terms of the relationship between the operative temperature (T-e), selected temperature (T-sel), set-point range (T-set) and field active body temperature (field T-sel), exposure to low temperature, body posture and activity. The T, range for P. in. melanotus was about 58 C (-3.20 C in winter to 54.94 C in summer). In a laboratory thermal gradient, in a setting that is independent of ecological costs or thermal constraints, lizards maintained T-set (defined as the interquartile range of T-sel after Hertz et al., 1993) between 29.00 +/- 0.36 C and 31.78 +/- 0.16 C in winter and 29.61 +/- 0.28 C and 32.47 +/- 0.18 C in summer. The mean T-sel was 30.08 +/- 0.14 C in winter and 30.99 +/- 0.11 C in summer. In the field, however, lizards achieved significantly lower T-b, which suggests that the thermal environment limited the T-b that lizards were able to achieve. Lizards were active for significantly longer and selected significantly higher T-b in Summer than in winter. During winter, lizards spent a significant amount of time at T-b below their lower critical limiting temperature (defined by loss of righting). The most frequently assumed body postures in summer were those where the head or body were raised, whereas, in winter, lizards usually lay with head and body flat on the rock substrate. We suggest that these differences reflect the physiological requirements of the lizards: Head-up postures in sit-and-wait foragers are consistent with scanning for prey while head-down postures are likely motivated by thermoregulatory needs. It is clear that P. m. melanotus can thermoregulate efficiently, but the T-b maintained may be constrained by the range of T-e available to the lizards in their natural environment. Pseudocordylus in, melanotus currently appears to be geographically constrained by low environmental temperatures at the edge of its range. Should global warming become a reality in southern Africa, this species could inadvertently benefit by occupying new habitat that was previously unavailable because of thermal constraints.

TI  - Metal Oxide-Based Materials for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
VL  - 37
IS  - 7
AB  - The CO2 level in the atmosphere has been increasing since the industrial revolution owing to anthropogenic activities. The increased CO2 level has led to global warming and also has detrimental effects on human beings. Reducing the CO2 level in the atmosphere is urgent for balancing the carbon cycle. In this regard, reduction in CO2 emission and CO2 storage and usage are the main strategies. Among these, CO2 usage has been extensively explored, because it can reduce the CO2 level and simultaneously provide opportunities for the development in catalysts and industries to convert CO2 as a carbon source for preparing valuable products. However, transformation of CO2 to other chemicals is challenging owing to its thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Among the CO2 utilization techniques, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising alternative because it is generally conducted under ambient conditions, and water is used as the economical hydrogen source. Moreover, ECR offers a potential route to store electrical energy from renewable sources in the form of chemical energy, through generation of CO2 reduction products. To improve the energy efficiency and viability of ECR, it is important to decrease the operational overpotential and maintain large current densities and high product selectivities; the development of efficient electrocatalysts is a critical aspect in this regard. To date, many kinds of materials have been designed and studied for application in ECR. Among these materials, metal oxide-based materials exhibit excellent performance as electrocatalysts for ECR and are attracting increasing attention in recent years. Investigation of the mechanism of reactions that involve metallic electrocatalysts has revealed the function of trace amount of oxidized metal species-it has been suggested that the presence of metal oxides and metal-oxygen bonds facilitates the activation of CO2 and the subsequent formation and stabilization of the reaction intermediates, thereby resulting in high efficiency and selectivity of the ECR. Although the stability of metal oxides is a concern as they are prone to reduction under a cathodic potential, the catalytic performance of metal oxide-based catalysts can be maintained through careful designing of the morphology and structure of the materials. In addition, introducing other metal species to metal oxides and fabricating composites of metal oxides and other materials are effective strategies to achieve enhanced performance in ECR. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the use of metal oxide-based materials as electrocatalysts and their application in ECR. The critical role, stability, and structure-performance relationship of the metal oxide-based materials for ECR are highlighted in the discussion. In the final part, we propose the future prospects for the development of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for ECR.

AB  - The impacts of carbon-based sources on anaerobic digestion methane generation were investigated in this study. The findings revealed that bio-solids and Hydro-chars may increase accumulative methane output by 16% to 30%. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference (statistically) (p > 0.05) in methane production from Hydro-chars and bio-solids generated at, unlike temperatures. Bio-solids and Hydro-chars augmented microorganisms that may contribute indirect interspecies electron transfer. Microorganisms' DIET in a stable environment created by carbon-based compounds with homogeneous dispersion and electrons were transported via an aromatic functional group on the surface of the material. From the fermented effluent, sludge recapture was 0.09 m(3) sludge / m(3) wastewater. The time required to recoup investment was calculated to be 3.72 years. This research reveals the impact of surface characteristics of carbon-based sources on methane generation in anaerobic fermentation and proposes a novel method for reusing discarded tea grounds.

VL  - 448
SP  - 464-475
AB  - The fish gut microbiota contributes to digestion and can affect the nutrition, growth, reproduction, overall population dynamics and vulnerability of the host fish to disease; therefore, this microbial community is highly relevant for aquaculture practice. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analysis have allowed us to develop a broader understanding of the complex microbial communities associated with various habitats, including the fish gut microbiota. These recent advances have substantially improved our knowledge of bacterial community profiles in the fish intestinal microbiota in response to a variety of factors affecting the host, including variations in temperature, salinity, developmental stage, digestive physiology and feeding strategy. The goal of this review is to highlight the potential of next-generation sequencing platforms for analysing fish gut microbiota. Recent and promising results in this field are presented along with a focus on new perspectives and future research directions of fish gut microbial ecology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a simplified operational process for lactic acid (LA) production from inedible starchy biomass by open fermentation using thermotolerant Lactobacillus rhamnosus DUT1908. One step simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification and fermentation (SLSF) was proposed to produce LA using aging paddy rice with hull (APRH) as feedstock. First, a robust microbial strain was obtained by adaptive laboratory evolution under high temperature stress. As a result, L. rhamnosus DUT1908 showed high thermotolerance up to 50 degrees C and high efficiency of substrate utilization. Then, the performance of this thermotolerant l-lactic acid producing strain was demonstrated. Finally, various fermentation strategies were compared for LA production from APRH, including simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and SLSF. In one-step open SLSF process, 107.8 g/L lactic acid was obtained with a productivity of 3.4 g/(L.h) and a yield to theoretical glucose of 0.89 g/g. This is the highest yield and productivity of lactic acid reported on starchy residues, and provides an efficient route for the development of high value-added products.

TI  - Inhibition of HSP90 attenuates porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus production in vitro
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection leads to substantial economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. However, no effective countermeasures exist to combat this virus infection so far. The most common antiviral strategy relies on directly inhibiting viral proteins. However, this strategy invariably leads to the emergence of drug resistance due to the error-prone nature of viral ploymerase. Targeting cellular proteins required for viral infection for developing new generation of antivirals is gaining concern. Recently, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) was found to be an important host factor for the replication of multiple viruses and the inhibition of HSP90 showed significant antiviral effects. It is thought that the inhibition of HSP90 could be a promising broad-range antiviral approach. However, the effects of HSP90 inhibition on PRRSV infection have not been evaluated. In the current research, we tried to inhibit HSP90 and test whether the inhibition affect PRRSV infection. Methods: We inhibit the function of HSP90 with two inhibitors, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamono-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), and down-regulated the expression of endogenous HSP90 with specific small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was measured with alamarBlue. The protein level of viral N was determined by western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Besides, IFA was employed to examine the level of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The viral RNA copy number and the level of IFN-beta mRNA were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR). Results: Our results indicated that both HSP90 inhibitors showed strong anti-PRRSV activity. They could reduce viral production by preventing the viral RNA synthesis. These inhibitory effects were not due to the activation of innate interferon response. In addition, we observed that individual knockdown targeting HSP90 alpha or HSP90 beta did not show dramatic inhibitory effect. Combined knockdown of these two isoforms was required to reduce viral infection. Conclusions: Our results shed light on the possibility of developing potential therapeutics targeting HSP90 against PRRSV infection.

TI  - Parabolic trough collectors for industrial process heat in Cyprus
VL  - 27
IS  - 9
SP  - 813-830
AB  - The thermal utilization of solar energy is usually confined to domestic hot water systems and somewhat to space heating at temperatures up to 60 degreesC. Industrial process heat has a considerable potential for solar energy utilization. Cyprus has a small isolated energy system, almost totally dependent on imported fuels to meet its energy demand. The abundance of solar radiation together with a good technological base, created favorable conditions for the exploitation of solar energy in the island. The number of units in operation today corresponds to one heater for every 3.7 people in the island, which is a world record. Despite this impressive record no solar industrial process heat system is in operation today. The main problem for this is the big expenditure required for such a system and the uncertainty of the benefits. The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of using parabolic trough collectors for industrial heat generation in Cyprus. The system is analyzed both thermally and economically with TRNSYS and the TMY for Nicosia, Cyprus, in order to show the magnitude of the expected benefits. The load is hot water delivered at 85 degreesC at a flow rate of 2000 kg/h for the first three quarters of each hour from 8:00-16:00 h, 5 days a week. The system consists of an array of parabolic trough collectors, hot water storage tank, piping and controls. The optimum collector area for the present application is 300 m(2), the optimum collector flow rate is 54 kg/m(2) h and the optimum storage tank size is 25 m(2). The system covers 50% of the annual load of the system and gives life cycle savings of about Cpound6200 ((euro)10800). This amount represent the money saved from the use of the system against paying for fuel. The savings however refer to a non-subsidized fuel price, which will be in effect from 2003. The optimum system can deliver a total of 896 GJ per year and avoids 208 tons Of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The effect of various design changes on the system performance was investigated. The E-W tracking system (collector axis aligned in N-S direction) was found to be superior to the N-S one. The required load temperature affects the performance of the system as for higher temperatures the auxiliary energy required is bigger. Also a number of variations in the load use pattern have been investigated and presented in this paper. It was found that the bigger the load (double shift, full hour use pattern) the bigger the collector area required, the greater the first year fuel savings and the greater the life cycle savings of the installation. This means that it is more viable to apply solar industrial process heat to higher energy consumption industries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 213
IS  - 6
SP  - 934-945
AB  - Coral mortality due to climate-associated stress is likely to increase as the oceans get warmer and more acidic. Coral bleaching and an increase in infectious disease are linked to above average sea surface temperatures. Despite the uncertain future for corals, recent studies have revealed physiological mechanisms that improve coral resilience to the effects of climate change. Some taxa of bleached corals can increase heterotrophic food intake and exchange symbionts for more thermally tolerant clades; this plasticity can increase the probability of surviving lethal thermal stress. Corals can fight invading pathogens with a suite of innate immune responses that slow and even arrest pathogen growth and reduce further tissue damage. Several of these responses, such as the melanin cascade, circulating amoebocytes and antioxidants, are induced in coral hosts during pathogen invasion or disease. Some components of immunity show thermal resilience and are enhanced during temperature stress and even in bleached corals. These examples suggest some plasticity and resilience to cope with environmental change and even the potential for evolution of resistance to disease. However, there is huge variability in responses among coral species, and the rate of climate change is projected to be so rapid that only extremely hardy taxa are likely to survive the projected changes in climate stressors.

TI  - Riparian aquatic interaction simulator (RAIS): a model of riparian forest dynamics for the generation of large woody debris and shade
VL  - 162
IS  - 2
SP  - 299-318
AB  - Streams depend on riparian forests to supply many important functions such as delivery of large woody debris (LWD), organic matter, and nutrients into the aquatic ecosystem and to provide shade to help maintain cool water. Both forests and streams are dynamic, and inputs from the riparian forest are constantly replenished as organic matter and nutrients are processed and transported. Forest stand dynamics have been intensively studied and foresters have developed a good understanding of tree growth and mortality to support commercial forest management. In recent years, the relationships between aquatic functions and adjacent forest stand characteristics have been increasingly quantified by ecologists. Management of riparian forests to protect aquatic functions and water quality has received considerable attention in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. For scientific knowledge to be useful to decision-makers, the complex set of riparian relationships, increasingly well understood individually, need to be collectively and objectively linked in a form that can be easily used by scientists and non-scientists alike to develop management strategies for riparian forests. In this paper we describe an analytical system that quantitatively links widely used forest growth forecasting systems for coastal Pacific Northwest forest types to the riparian ecological functions of large woody debris recruitment and shade. The riparian aquatic interaction simulator (RAIS), with its user-friendly interface, allows managers to forecast aquatic functions for up to 300 years. RAIS provides these forecasts over a range of critical input variables and produces realistic estimates of riparian functions when compared with published research.

VL  - 11
IS  - 13
SP  - 6101-6107
AB  - The realization of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials in conjunction with the intriguing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has provided a fertile ground for novel physics and for the next-generation spintronic and topological devices. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT), we predict that layered 5d transition-metal heavier halides (TMHs), such as ReX3 (X = Br, I), show intrinsic ferromagnetism with high spin polarization and high Curie temperatures. The outstanding dynamic and thermodynamic stability ensures their experimental feasibility. The strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Re makes the electronic structure of the ReI3 monolayer topologically nontrivial with a large Chern number (C = -4). DFT+U calculations reveal that the 2D system undergoes a nontrivial to trivial transition with increasing on-site Hubbard Coulomb interaction U through the emergence of a Dirac cone. This transition is corroborated by the emergence of chiral edge states and the anomalous Hall conductivity. These findings not only demonstrate room-temperature ferromagnetism in atomically thin 5d TMHs, but also pave the way for the potential realization of the QAH effect with high Chern numbers in pristine 2D layers.

TI  - Supporting local farming communities and crop production resilience to climate change through giant reed (Arundo donax L.) cultivation: An Italian case study
VL  - 601
SP  - 603-613
AB  - Bioenergy crops are well known for their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the soil carbon stock. Although such crops are often held to be in competition with food crops and thus raise the question of current and future food security, at the same time mitigation measures are required to tackle climate change and sustain local farming communities and crop production. However, in some cases the actions envisaged for specific pedo-climatic conditions are not always economically sustainable by farmers. In this frame, energy crops with high environmental adaptability and yields, such as giant reed (Arundo donax L.), may represent an opportunity to improve farm incomes, making marginal areas not suitable for food production once again productive. In so doing, three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations would be met, namely SDG 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture, SDG 7 on reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13 on action to combat climate change and its impacts. In this work, the response of giant reed in the marginal areas of an agricultural district of southern Italy (Destra Sele) and expected farm incomes under climate change (2021-2050) are evaluated. The normalized water productivity index of giant reed was determined (WP; 30.1 g m(-2)) by means of a SWAP agro-hydrological model, calibrated and validated on two years of a long-term field experiment. The model was used to estimate giant reed response (biomass yield) in marginal areas under climate change, and economic evaluation was performed to determine expected farmincomes (woodchips and chopped forage). The results show that woodchip production represents the most profitable option for farmers, yielding a gross margin 50% lower than ordinary highinput maize cultivation across the study area.

TI  - TECTONOTHERMAL EVOLUTION OF THE HIGH HIMALAYAN CRYSTALLINE SEQUENCE, LANGTANG VALLEY, NORTHERN NEPAL
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 439-452
AB  - The High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence in north-central Nepal is a 15-km-thick pile of metasediments that is bound by the Main Central Thrust to the south and a normal fault to the north. The Langtang section through the metasediments shows an apparent inversion of metamorphic isograds with high-P, kyanite-grade rocks exposed beneath low-P, sillimanite-grade rocks. Textural evidence confirms that the observed inversion is a result of a polyphase metamorphic history and phase equilibria studies indicate that thermal decoupling has occurred within a mechanically coherent section of crust. Rocks now exposed at the base of the High Himalayan thrust sheet underwent Barrovian regional metamorphism (MI) prior to 34Ma in the early stages of the Himalayan orogeny, recording metamorphic conditions of T = 710 +/- 30-degrees-C, P = 9 +/- 1 kbar. After the activation of the Main Central Thrust, which emplaced these metapelites southwards onto the lower grade Lesser Himalayan formations, the upper part of the thrust sheet was overprinted by a second heating event (M2), resulting in sillimanite-grade metamorphism and anatexis of metapelites at T = 760 +/- 30-degrees-C, P = 5.8 +/- 0.4 kbar between 17 and 20 Ma. Crustally derived, leucogranite magmas have been emplaced into low-grade Tethyan sediments on the hangingwall of the normal fault that bounds the northern limit of the metapelitic sequence. The cause of the selective heating of the upper section of the metasediments during M2 cannot be reconciled with either post-thrusting thermal relaxation or advection models. The cause of M2 remains problematical but it is suggested that heat focusing has occurred at the top of the High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence as a result of movement on the normal fault blanketing metapelites of high heat productivity with low-grade sediments of low thermal conductivity. This model implies that the normal fault was active before M2, consistent with decompression textures that formed during, or shortly after, sillimanite-grade metamorphism.

These linkages are captured by the concept of the niche, which has guided theoretical and empirical research in ecology for decades. Despite this research, we still cannot explain or predict much of the variation in niches over space and time. This shortcoming hinders efforts to forecast biological responses to environmental change. We believe that progress has been slowed by poor coordination between theoretical and empirical efforts to understand the evolution of niches. Therefore, progress should be sped by research programs that integrate modeling and experiments. Such research programs should focus on the structures of environmental variation, the constraints on phenotypes, and the relationships between phenotypes and fitness.

TI  - Existence of infective juveniles in the offspring of first- and second-generation adults of Steinernema rarum (OLI strain): evaluation of their virulence
VL  - 85
IS  - 1
SP  - 33-39
AB  - Descriptions of the life cycle of the genus Steinernema do not consider the production of infective juveniles (Us) by the first-generation developed within the insect host when more than one generation develops. We demonstrated IJ production by first- and second-generation adults of Steinernema rarum (OLI strain), evaluated their virulence and compared virulence and morphometric characters between the two IJ forms. Our results demonstrated not only the presence of Us in the offspring of first- and second-generation adults but also a greater virulence of first-generation Us. Both types of Us also differed in five morphometric characters. According to our results, a population of Us emerging from a host cadaver has individuals of two generations with different characteristics; hence, they should not be considered the same. These generational differences may be exploited, for example, for biocontrol purposes, by using a specific generation of Us for inoculative release. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Host Plant Determines the Population Size of an Obligate Symbiont (Buchnera aphidicola) in Aphids
VL  - 82
IS  - 8
SP  - 2336-2346
AB  - Buchnera aphidicola is an obligate endosymbiont that provides aphids with several essential nutrients. Though much is known about aphid-Buchnera interactions, the effect of the host plant on Buchnera population size remains unclear. Here we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques to explore the effects of the host plant on Buchnera densities in the cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii. Buchnera titers were significantly higher in populations that had been reared on cucumber for over 10 years than in populations maintained on cotton for a similar length of time. Aphids collected in the wild from hibiscus and zucchini harbored more Buchnera symbionts than those collected from cucumber and cotton. The effect of aphid genotype on the population size of Buchnera depended on the host plant upon which they fed. When aphids from populations maintained on cucumber or cotton were transferred to novel host plants, host survival and Buchnera population size fluctuated markedly for the first two generations before becoming relatively stable in the third and later generations. Host plant extracts from cucumber, pumpkin, zucchini, and cowpea added to artificial diets led to a significant increase in Buchnera titers in the aphids from the population reared on cotton, while plant extracts from cotton and zucchini led to a decrease in Buchnera titers in the aphids reared on cucumber. Gossypol, a secondary metabolite from cotton, suppressed Buchnera populations in populations from both cotton and cucumber, while cucurbitacin from cucurbit plants led to higher densities. Together, the results suggest that host plants influence Buchnera population processes and that this may provide phenotypic plasticity in host plant use for clonal aphids.

TI  - Climate anomalies and competition reduce establishment success during island colonization
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain establishment of populations in novel environments is crucial for conservation biology and the study of adaptive radiation. Important questions include: (1) Does the timing of colonization relative to stochastic events, such as climatic perturbations, impact the probability of successful establishment? (2) To what extent does community context (e.g., the presence of competitors) change the probability of establishment? (3) How do sources of intrapopulation variance, such as sex differences, affect success at an individual level during the process of establishment? Answers to these questions are rarely pursued in a field-experimental context or on the same time scales (months to years) as the processes of colonization and establishment. We introduced slender anole lizards (Anolis apletophallus) to eight islands in the Panama Canal and tracked them over multiple generations to investigate the factors that mediate establishment success. All islands were warmer than the mainland (ancestral) environment, and some islands had a native competitor. We transplanted half of these populations only 4 months before the onset of a severe regional drought and the other half 2 years (two generations) before the drought. We found that successful establishment depended on both the intensity of interspecific competition and the timing of colonization relative to the drought. The islands that were colonized shortly before the drought went functionally extinct by the second generation, and regardless of time before the drought, the populations on islands with interspecific competition declined continuously over the study period. Furthermore, the effect of the competitor interacted with sex, with males suffering, and females benefitting, from the presence of a native competitor. Our results reveal that community context and the timing of colonization relative to climactic events can combine to determine establishment success and that these factors can generate opposite effects on males and females.

TI  - Response to temperature of Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Aphidiinae) from three climatic regions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil
VL  - 49
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-147
AB  - Response to temperature of Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Aphidimae) from three climatic regions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck, 1912 presents higher mortality at constant temperatures above 25 degrees C, and probably it is the cause of the failure on the biological control of Aphis gossypii Glover, 1877 when this parasitoid is used at higher temperatures in greenhouses. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of different temperatures on individuals of A. colemani from different climatic regions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Individuals of A. colemani were collected in the localities of Juramento, Lavras and Sao Gotardo, and reared in laboratory (22+/-2 degrees C, 70+/-10% RH and 12h photophase) for three generations in the host A. gossypii, on cucumber plants. One mated female of A. colemani, 24-48 h old, was released for one hour, in a Petri dish (15cm) with 20 nymphs of 2(nd) instar of A. gossypii on a leaf disk of cucumber (4 cm of diameter) laid on a layer of agar-water (1%). The parasitized aphids were kept at 16, 19, 22, 25 and 28+/-1 degrees C, 70+/-10% RH and 12h photophase. The emergence rates of individuals from Juramento (65.9 and 35.4%) and Sao Gotardo (71.4 and 47.6%) were lower compared to those from Lavras (87.1 and 80.9%) at 16 and 28 degrees C. The more suitable temperature for the development of A. colemani from Lavras was higher than those for individuals from Juramento and Sao Gotardo. The individuals from Lavras showed highest emergence at 28 degrees C, and this demonstrated the existence of individuals of A. colemani with tolerance to higher temperatures. These results open news perspectives on the use of different strains of A. colemani on biological control of A. gossypii in protected cultivation.

VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 420-424
AB  - Longevity, preoviposition period, and fecundity of deutogynes of the pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri (Nalepa), were measured at three constant temperatures (10, 15, and 20-degrees-C), and compared between deutogyne and protogyne females at 20-degrees-C. Relationships between temperature (10, 15, 20, and 25-degrees-C) and the rate of development (days-1) of eggs, nymphs, and generations (egg to adult) were described using least-squares linear regression. Mean longevity and preoviposition period of deutogynes decreased with increasing temperature. The average rate of oviposition increased with temperature, but lifetime fecundity did not differ among temperatures. At 20-degrees-C, protogynes began ovipositing sooner than deutogynes and laid more eggs at a faster rate, but average longevity of the two morphs was the same. Significant linear relationships were found between temperature and the developmental rates of eggs, nymphs, and generations. Threshold base temperatures for development of eggs, nymphs, and generations were 2.2, 3.3, and 3.8-degrees-C, respectively. Degree-day (+/-SEM) requirements for median development of eggs, nymphs, and generations were 93.5 +/- 2.5, 78.7 +/- 3.4, and 144.9 +/- 3.6 above their respective threshold temperatures. These results are compared with estimated developmental requirements calculated from Easterbrook (1978).

TI  - Optimizing sampling strategies in high-resolution paleoclimate records
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
SP  - 1315-1340
AB  - The aim of paleoclimate studies resolving climate variability from noisy proxy records can in essence be reduced to a statistical problem. The challenge is to extract meaningful information about climate variability from these records by reducing measurement uncertainty through combining measurements for proxies while retaining the temporal resolution needed to assess the timing and duration of variations in climate parameters. In this study, we explore the limits of this compromise by testing different methods for combining proxy data (smoothing, binning, and sample size optimization) on a particularly challenging paleoclimate problem: resolving seasonal variability in stable isotope records. We test and evaluate the effects of changes in the seasonal temperature and the hydrological cycle as well as changes in the accretion rate of the archive and parameters such as sampling resolution and age model uncertainty in the reliability of seasonality reconstructions based on clumped and oxygen isotope analyses in 33 real and virtual datasets. Our results show that strategic combinations of clumped isotope analyses can significantly improve the accuracy of seasonality reconstructions compared to conventional stable oxygen isotope analyses, especially in settings in which the isotopic composition of the water is poorly constrained. Smoothing data using a moving average often leads to an apparent dampening of the seasonal cycle, significantly reducing the accuracy of reconstructions. A statistical sample size optimization protocol yields more precise results than smoothing. However, the most accurate results are obtained through monthly binning of proxy data, especially in cases in which growth rate or water composition cycles obscure the seasonal temperature cycle. Our analysis of a wide range of natural situations reveals that the effect of temperature seasonality on oxygen isotope records almost invariably exceeds that of changes in water composition. Thus, in most cases, oxygen isotope records allow reliable identification of growth seasonality as a basis for age modeling in the absence of independent chronological markers in the record. These specific findings allow us to formulate general recommendations for sampling and combining data in paleoclimate research and have implications beyond the reconstruction of seasonality. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for solving common problems in paleoclimatology and stratigraphy.

VL  - 536
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-20
AB  - In this study, a temperature and ROS-responsive drug delivery system ROSP@MSN based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles has been designed and synthesized by taking advantage of 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) benzyl acrylate modified polymers (ROSP) as "nano-valve", which can respond selectively to cancer exclusive microenvironment and implement targeted drug release. Due to the superior temperature-sensitive properties of ROSP, ROSP@MSN could achieve cargo loading in cold water, and subsequently close the pore by raising temperature to obtain ROSP@MSN@DOX. Upon the stimulus of ROS, ROSP@MSN@DOX shows good release performance at physiological conditions. The cytotoxicity study demonstrates that the cell viability is about 80% after Hela cells are treated with ROSP@MSN at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, exhibiting the good biocompatibility of ROSP@MSN. Furthermore, after treated with ROSP@MSN@DOX at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, the viability of Hela cells is reduced to 40.5%; Control experiments demonstrate that, when Hela cells are pretreated with active oxygen scavenger, cell viability is about 65.3% due to the significant decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the therapeutic nanocarrier with effective encapsulation and release capacity in particular situation is a great candidate for the new drug delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy.

AB  - Prediction of pollutant emissions is a key aspect of modern combustor design in energy conversion systems. In the presented work, a simple and robust model based on low-order reaction networks is applied to a FLOX(R) laboratory combustor at atmospheric conditions. The applied approach is computationally cheap and therefore highly suited for design studies. Steady-state CFD RANS simulations are carried out, serving as a basis for the network generation algorithm. CFD results are validated with experimental data for flow field and combustion. Different degrees of fidelity of reactor network models are taken into consideration and findings are opposed to measurements, evaluating the quality of the low-fidelity models. Validation of CO and NOx emission results of reactor network modeling provides accurate qualitative and quantitative reproduction of experimental findings, depending on the degree of heat loss applied on the combustion system. The introduced approach is therefore readily applicable to large-scale, industrial, and gas turbine combustion.

AB  - Robustness is the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbation. The robustness of phenotypes appears at various levels of biological organization, including gene expression, protein folding, metabolic flux, physiological homeostasis, development, and even organismal fitness. The mechanisms underlying robustness are diverse, ranging from thermodynamic stability at the RNA and protein level to behavior at the organismal level. Phenotypes can be robust either against heritable perturbations (e.g., mutations) or nonheritable perturbations (e.g., the weather). Here we primarily focus on the first kind of robustness-genetic robustness-and survey three growing avenues of research: (1) measuring genetic robustness in nature and in the laboratory; (2) understanding the evolution of genetic robustness; and (3) exploring the implications of genetic robustness for future evolution.

TI  - Temperature influences habitat preference of coral reef fishes: Will generalists become more specialised in a warming ocean?
VL  - 24
IS  - 7
SP  - 3158-3169
AB  - Climate change is expected to pose a significant risk to species that exhibit strong behavioural preferences for specific habitat types, with generalist species assumed to be less vulnerable. In this study, we conducted habitat choice experiments to determine how water temperature influences habitat preference for three common species of coral reef damselfish (Pomacentridae) that differ in their levels of habitat specialisation. The lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, a habitat specialist, consistently selected complex coral habitat across all temperature treatments (selected based on local average seasonal temperatures naturally experienced insitu: ambient winter 22 degrees C; ambient summer 28 degrees C; and elevated 31 degrees C). Unexpectedly, the neon damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis and scissortail sergeant Abudefduf sexfasciatus, both of which have more generalist habitat associations, developed strong habitat preferences (for complex coral and boulder habitat, respectively) at the elevated temperature treatment (31 degrees C) compared to no single preferred habitat at 22 degrees C or 28 degrees C. The observed shifts in habitat preference with temperature suggest that we may be currently underestimating the vulnerability of some habitat generalists to climate change and highlight that the ongoing loss of complex live coral through coral bleaching could further exacerbate resource overlap and species competition in ways not currently considered in climate change models.

TI  - On optimum dynamic temperature profiles for thermal inactivation kinetics determination
VL  - 86
IS  - 6
SP  - 2172-2193
AB  - Determination of inactivation kinetics, associated with thermal processing of foods and obtained from dynamic temperature experiments, requires carefully designed experiments, the primary element being the selection of the appropriate temperature profile along with a carefully planned sampling schedule. In the present work, a number of different dynamic temperature profiles were investigated in terms of their ability to generate accurate kinetic parameters with low confidence intervals (CIs). Although alternative models have been also tested, our work was concentrated on thermal inactivation kinetics that could be described by the classical D-z values. A pair of D and z values was assumed, and for each temperature profile tested, concentration data at different processing times were generated through the appropriate models. Next, an error (up to +/- 2.5% or +/- 5%) was introduced on these theoretical values to generate pseudo-experimental data, and the back-calculation of the assumed kinetic parameters by non-linear regression was performed. The accuracy and the 95% CIs of the estimated kinetic parameters were evaluated; joint confidence regions were also constructed to investigate parameters correlation. The effect of temperature profile pattern, level of error, number of experimental points, and reference temperature was assessed. A stepwise increasing and a single triangle-pattern temperature profile were the best profiles among those tested. As a general observation, based on different kinetic models investigated, temperature profiles and sampling intervals that result in concentration versus time diagrams having shapes as suggested by the primary model used when isothermally applied are not considered appropriate for parameter estimation.

VL  - 140
IS  - 3
SP  - 429-440
AB  - Weather based prediction models for leaf rust were developed using disease severity and weather data recorded at four locations viz. Ludhiana, Kanpur, Faizabad and Sabour of the All India Wheat and Barley Improvement Project. Weeks 7-9 of the crop growing season at Ludhiana, Faizabad and Sabour and weeks 10-12 at Kanpur were identified as critical periods for relating weather variables to disease. Highly significant correlation coefficients were found between disease severity and a greater number of weather variables in these critical 3-week periods than at other times. The correlation coefficients were greatest for the Humid Thermal Ratio (HTR), Maximum Temperature (MXT) and Special Humid Thermal Ratio (SHTR), and these three weather variables were selected as predictor variables. Linear regressions with these predictor variables (individually) during the critical periods, and a multiple regression with MXT and relative humidity (RH), serve as four disease prediction models, with sufficient lead-time to take control measures. Validation of these prediction models with independent disease severity data showed that the regression equation with MXT (Model-1) was the best among the prediction models, with four out of six simulations matching observed disease severity classes and also having lowest residual sum of squares (SSE) value of 2727. Models 4 (multiple regression), 2 (HTR) and 3 (SHTR) with SSE values of 2881, 3092 and 3732, respectively are in order of decreasing accuracy of prediction. The model using MXT can be used to predict the disease severity in the Indo-Gangetic Plains and provide the basis for efficient disease control.

AB  - Empirical data suggest that recombination rates may change in response to stress. To study the evolution of plastic recombination, we develop a modifier model using the same theoretical framework used to study conventional (nonplastic) modifiers, thus allowing direct comparison. We examine the evolution of plastic recombination in both haploid and diploid systems. In haploids, a plastic modifier spreads by forming associations with selectively favored alleles. Relative to nonplastic effects, selection On the plastic effects of a modifier is both much stronger and less sensitive to the specifics of the selection regime (e.g., epistasis). In contrast, the evolution of plastic recombination in diploids is much more restricted. Selection on plasticity requires the ability to detect DNA damage or cis-trans effects as may Occur trough maternal effects on fitness.

AB  - Facultative diapause a strategy that allows insects to initiate additional generations when conditions are favorable or to enter diapause when they are not has a profound effect on the ecology and evolution of species Most previous studies have concentrated on the role of photoperiod and temperature in inducing facultative diapause in insects In contrast here we studied pupal diapause mediated by larval host plants in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera and confirmed that pupal weight is a critical factor Two groups of third instar H armigera larvae kept at 25 C with L D = 8 16 and 20 C with photoperiod of L D = 8 16 respectively were fed on six host plants and on artificial diet (as a control) to determine how larval host plants affect diapause incidence and related traits (such as pupal weight and developmental duration) The data showed larval host plants affected diapause incidence significantly and the effects could be masked by low temperature Further analysis showed that pupal size not the length of the sensitive stage affected the decision to enter diapause In a further experiment third-instar to final-stage larvae deprived of artificial diet for 2 days demonstrated a direct relationship between pupal weight and diapause incidence These results suggest that larval host plants by affecting pupal size may influence diapause occurrence in H armigera This has important adaptive significance for both over-wintering survival and the possibility for completing an additional generation (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - As attempt of elucidating the environmental factors that they control the plasticity floral fenotipic of Catasetum fimbriatum Lindley, climatics studies of the species began, through of the accompaniment of 45 individuals divided in three installed treatments. The first fifteen individuals, they were conditioned at green house where intense brightness prevailed (1300 at 1900 mu mol/m(2)s), high temperatures (38 degrees C) and it lowers relative humidity of the air (35%). Such treatment was entitled treatment 1. The other collected individuals that were put in the pot, and that they constituted the treatment 2, they were submitted the low luminous intensity (400 at 650 mu mol/m(2)s), to a smaller temperature (17 degrees C) and a relative humidity of the highest air (85%). The last fifteen individuals, presented the natural conditions of survival of the species, and they constituted in that way, the treatment 3 (luminous intensity between 500 at 800 mu mol/m(2)s, temperature of 23 degrees C and a relative humidity of the highest air of 65%). At the end of the experiment, the great adaptability could be verified of the species to the differentiated environments, through the ecotipes formation.

SP  - 389-406
AB  - This paper is an overview of the latest approaches to achieve equilibrium and above equilibrium electrical activation of the source/drain extensions for the 70 nm CMOS technology node and beyond. Topics include ion implantation (11) + Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA), Solid Phase Epitaxy (SPE), Laser Thermal Annealing (LTA), and selective silicon recess followed by epitaxial deposition of heavily doped Silicon Germanium (SiGe). Additionally, a novel epitaxial approach incorporating a carbon doped underlayer to mediate,boron outdiffusion will be introduced. For each technology this paper reviews the projected targets, process and integration challenges, and the viability of the approach for drain extension junction depths and sheet resistance targets imposed by National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS). Conclusions will be supported by empirical observations and materials characterization results, as appropriate. The primary focus of this paper is on p-MOS, which has traditionally posed more challenges in achieving the optimum junction depth required to maximize the transistor drive current for a given metallurgical channel length and off-state current. This technology review will also include the significant tradeoffs between short channel effects attributed to deep junctions and the parasitic resistance of shallow junctions.

VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 710-725
AB  - Examining variation in fish populations over time is strengthened when climatic variations are understood and incorporated into analyses. We used a 18-year brook trout (Saivelinus fontinalis) data set with samples across a similar to 4800 km(2) spatial area in the Central Appalachian Mountains, combined with PRISM climate data at the HUC-12 subwatershed level to investigate temporal trends of each. We found significant increases in air temperature (p <.01) with no significant trends in precipitation across time, including no trends in changes in variation of temperature and precipitation also. Extreme rainfall events (# of days above 95% percentile for total daily precipitation in a year) and consecutive dry days (cumulative # of consecutive days with <3 mm precipitation in a year) were also examined arid produced no significantly changing trends over time. Using random forests, seasonal climate variables identified as changing over time explained 35.1% of the variability in young-of-the-year brook trout abundance over the 18-year monitoring period. The same procedure explained 25.1% of the variability in juvenile abundance and only 5.1% in adult abundance. Variable selection following random forest generation illustrated significant effects for winter and spring precipitation (both negative on young-of-the-year abundance. Spring degree days and spring precipitation both had significant negative effects on juvenile abundance. Random effects for stream and year explained a maximum of 27.7% and 10.8% of the variation in abundance across all models. A significant, positive interaction between spring degree days and precipitation was also identified, lending support to the important balance between temperature and flow in these systems that is critical to brook trout persistence. This work provides long-term evidence to help understand the dynamics of these sentinel headwater fish populations as they experience a changing climate.

TI  - State of newborn care in South Sudan's displacement camps: a descriptive study of facility-based deliveries
VL  - 14
AB  - Background: Approximately 2.7 million neonatal deaths occur annually, with highest rates of neonatal mortality in countries that have recently experienced conflict. Constant instability in South Sudan further strains a weakened health system and poses public health challenges during the neonatal period. We aimed to describe the state of newborn facility-level care in displaced person camps across Juba, Malakal, and Maban. Methods: We conducted clinical observations of the labor and delivery period, exit interviews with recently delivered mothers, health facility assessments, and direct observations of midwife time-use. Study participants were mother-newborn pairs who sought services and birth attendants who provided delivery services between April and June 2016 in five health facilities. Results: Facilities were found to be lacking the recommended medical supplies for essential newborn care. Two of the five facilities had skilled midwives working during all operating hours, with 6.2% of their time spent on postnatal care. Selected components of thermal care (62.5%), infection prevention (74.8%), and feeding support (63.6%) were commonly practiced, but postnatal monitoring (27.7%) was less consistently observed. Differences were found when comparing the primary care level to the hospital (thermal: relative risk [RR] 0.48 [95% CI] 0.40-0.58; infection: RR 1.28 [1.11-1.47]; feeding: RR 0.49 [0.40-0.58]; postnatal: RR 3.17 [2.01-5.00]). In the primary care level, relative to newborns delivered by traditional birth attendants, those delivered by skilled attendants were more likely to receive postnatal monitoring (RR 1.59 [1.09-2. 32]), but other practices were not statistically different. Mothers' knowledge of danger signs was poor, with fever as the highest reported (44.8%) followed by not feeding well (41.0%), difficulty breathing (28.9%), reduced activity (27.7%), feeling cold (18.0%) and convulsions (11.2%). Conclusions: Addressing health service delivery in contexts affected by conflict is vital to reducing the global newborn mortality rate and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. Gaps in intrapartum and postnatal care, particularly skilled care at birth, suggest a critical need to build the capacity of the existing health workforce while increasing access to skilled deliveries.

VL  - 81
SP  - 514-527
AB  - A potentially important physiological response to stress may be alteration in the gross regulation of energy metabolism. Different genotypes may respond differently to environmental stress, and the variation in these norms of reaction may be of key importance to the maintenance of genetic variation in metabolic traits. In the study reported here, a set of genetically defined lines of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to four stresses (acetic acid, ethanol, starvation and thermal stress) in order to assess the magnitude of environmental effects and genotype x environment interactions. In addition to scoring metabolic traits, distributions of survival times under each stress were also quantified. Although both metabolic traits and survival times exhibited strong differences among genotypes, the correlations between enzyme traits and survival were generally weak. Many of the genetic correlations exhibit significant heterogeneity across environments. The results suggest that transient environmental stress may play an important role in the evolution of this highly intercorrelated set of metabolic traits.

TI  - Facile synthesis of Ni-incorporated and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide as an effective electrode material for tri(ammonium) phosphate electro-oxidation
VL  - 3
IS  - 6
SP  - 2760-2771
AB  - Tri(ammonium) phosphate is a cheap and commercially available compound and is used as a fertilizer. This substance possesses a considerable amount of hydrogen. Recently, it has been found that the embedded hydrogen could be extracted from tri(ammonium) phosphate using a Ni/C heterocatalytic reaction. In this study, for the first time based on our knowledge, extraction of hydrogen from tri(ammonium) phosphate was performed electrolytically using Ni-incorporated and N-doped reduced graphene oxide. The proposed electrocatalyst was prepared by a simple one-pot synthesis procedure. Typically, a well-mixed nickel acetate tetrahydrate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture has been calcined under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 degrees C. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed the formation of zero-valent nickel and reduced graphene oxide because of the clear appearance of the corresponding peaks. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses concluded the formation of graphene sheets functionalized by oxygenated groups and doped by pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen; however only pyrrolic nitrogen has been detected in Ni-free samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated the formation of multilayer reduced graphene oxide. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the prepared composite is an effective electrocatalyst for tri(ammonium) phosphate oxidation when the nickel content is optimized. The electrode containing 31.9 wt% Ni shows the maximum generated current density; however, clear oxidation peaks were observed with 40.2 wt% formulation. Overall, the study introduces tri(ammonium) phosphate as a model for a new class of hydrogen-rich, cheap and available substances for hydrogen generation using non-precious electrodes. Besides that, the novel functionalized and N-doped reduced graphene oxide synthesis methodology may attract attention due to its distinct simplicity compared to the reported procedures.

TI  - Two generations of meiotic gynogenesis significantly elevate homogeneity and confirm genetic mode of sex determination in bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis)
VL  - 547
AB  - Gynogenesis is an effective technique for establishing pure line and validating possible chromosomal mode of sex determination in fish. As one of the major aquaculture fish historically cultured in China, bighead carp (Hypo-phthalmichthys nobilis) is famous for its market value of the head, but slow in its genetic improvement due to a long period of sexual maturation. In this study, females of bighead carp (F0 dams) with fast growth and bigger head were chose to induce first and second generation of meiotic gynogenesis (GF1 and GF2 for short) by using UV-irradiated heterologous sperm of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). On average, diploid gynogens were obtained by cold shock with a survival rate of 7.36% for GF1 and 6.24% for GF2, respectively. Results of morphology comparison and parentage assignment showed that all survival gynogens were genetically derived from the dams. Compared with their F0 parents, heterozygosities of GF1 and GF2 gynogens decreased by 42% and 60% when analyzed using 50 SSRs, and by 35% and 53% when using 1505 SNP markers, respectively. Sexing of the GF1 and GF2 gynogens showed all-female genotypes and phenotypes when examined by male-specific DNA markers, histology section and morphology of gonads. Overall, large number of meiotic gynogens have been successfully induced in two consecutive generations, providing valuable resources for fast domestication and genetic improvement in bighead carp. Our evidence of sex ratios in both GF1 and GF2 gynogens also strongly supports a proposed chromosomal mechanism of sex determination (XX/XY) for this large-size cyprinid fish.

VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 585-596
AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals emphasize the need to better understand and propose solutions for the growing demand for resources and the generation of waste by anthropic systems at any scale and intensity. Although it can be considered as secondary importance problem, hundreds of tons of green coconut shell residues annually generated in the Brazilian coastal cities are transported and dumped in landfills, wasting their energy potential and resulting in economic and environmental problems - this approach is known as take, make, disposal, or "linear" production model. This work proposes a "circular" model by using the biomass from green coconut shells generated by the cities of Baixada Santista region as a raw material for briquettes production. Technicaloperational, environmental, and financial aspects are considered to assess the proposed "circular" model in comparison with the existing "linear" model. Results show that technical-operational aspects of the "circular" model are viable due to already existing technologies in the market that can be easily adapted for the purposes in converting green coconut shells into briquettes. The "circular" model proposed allows a reduction in greenhouse gases emission by similar to 40 thousand tons year(-1) when compared to the "linear" model, besides avoiding leachate generation. Furthermore, the 66% profitability, 195% rentability, and 6 months of investment payback suggest the financial viability of briquettes production. Together, all these indicators claim for public policies incentives and private investments to make the proposed "circular" model a reality, which is aligned with the objectives of 2030 agenda.

VL  - 88

SP  - 2744-2747
AB  - Beam facing elements of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) Linear Particle Accelerator prototype (LIPAc) must stop 5-40 MeV D+ ions with a peak current of 125 mA. The duty cycle of the beam loading varies from 0.1% to 100% (CW), depending on the device, with the ions being stopped in the first hundreds microns of the beam facing material. For intermediate duty cycles up to CW, the thermal load can be considered a heat flux load on the boundary, but this approximation gets too conservative as the duty cycle is reduced because the thermal diffusion becomes more important. Instant heat flux produced by the beam can reach up to 3 GW/m(2) in elements such as the beam dump and slits during short times of hundredths of microseconds. In these cases, the accuracy of the volumetric heat generation is critical for obtaining realistic results. Meshfree Galerkin methods discretize a continuum using scattered nodes. As opposed to FEM, no predefined connectivity is needed between the nodes, so C (infinitely differentiable) locally supported shape functions can be used to approximate both the trial and the test functions. This feature makes these type of methods well suited for those problems where the domain experiences very large deformations or has high gradients of the state variables. Radial basis (RBF) and moving least squares (MLS) functions have been applied to the simulation of complex nonlinear mechanical problems involving large strains and displacements (e.g. flexible multibody dynamics). When compared to Finite Element Method (FEM), they present higher robustness under large strains and a better precision for the same computer calculation time when dealing with rough discretizations. All these results have been previously shown in Pl. The experience gained with those applications and the reproductivity characteristics of the shape functions suggest that the number of degrees of freedom needed for a precise analysis of shallow volumetric heat loads can be drastically reduced from that of the usual FEM approach. We describe the development and implementation of a coupled nonlinear thermo-mechanical formulation which takes into account the particularities of the meshfree discretization. Numerical experiments of beam facing elements are presented and compared with FEM results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 24

SP  - 1171-1185
AB  - The importance of ammonia in the fertilizer industry has been widely acknowledged over the past decades. In view of the upcoming increase of world population and, in turn, food demand, its production rate is likely to increase exponentially. However, considering the high dependence on natural resources and the intensive emission profile of the contemporary ammonia synthesis route, as well as the rigid environmental laws being enforced at a global level, the need to develop a sustainable alternative production route becomes quite imperative. A novel approach toward the synthesis of ammonia has been realized by means of non-thermal plasma technology under ambient operating conditions. Because the given technology is still under development, carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) is highly recommended as a means of identifying areas of the chemical process that could be potentially improved for an enhanced environmental performance. For that purpose, in the given research study, a process design for a small-scale plasma-assisted ammonia plant is being proposed and evaluated environmentally for specific design scenarios against the conventional ammonia synthesis employing steam reforming and water electrolysis for hydrogen generation. On the basis of the LCA results, the most contributory factor to the majority of the examined life cycle impact categories for the plasma-assisted process, considering an energy efficiency of 1.9 g NH3/kWh, is the impact of the power consumption of the plasma reactor with its share ranging from 15% to 73%. On a comparative basis, the plasma process powered by hydropower has demonstrated a better overall environmental profile over the two benchmark cases for the scenarios of a 5% and 15% NH3 yield and an energy recovery of 5% applicable to all examined plasma power consumption values.

VL  - 62
IS  - 5
SP  - 1799-1809
AB  - Carbon dioxide levels in many estuaries fluctuate and, in several cases, reach extremes much higher than those predicted for oceans by the end of the century. Moreover, estuaries are characterized by natural fluctuations in salinity, and reduced pH, from increased pCO(2), exposes estuarine organisms to multiple stresses. Although the effects of low pH on the reproduction of several marine copepod species have been assessed, studies examining effects of pH in estuarine copepod species are extremely scarce. Here, we aim at understanding the reproductive response of Gladioferens pectinatus to the stress posed by both salinity and pH. G. pectinatus was exposed to salinities 2 and 10, at four different pH levels each. Our results show no impairment in the brood size, embryonic development time and hatching success under low pH levels at either salinities. However, at salinity 2, the percentage of nauplii growing into adults significantly decreased at low pH, whereas at salinity 10, no major effect was observed. We argue that the combination of osmoregulation and acidity induced stress response can affect the development of nauplii and copepodites, as well as adult recruitment, likely due to energy reallocation and molting impairment. We also argue that resilience and phenotypic plasticity highly influence the ability of different copepod species and populations to reproduce and grow under stressful combinations of environmental parameters. This study points out the importance of understanding the effects of multiple stresses or parameters on the adaptability of organisms to water acidification.

TI  - A New Grade of High Thermal Conductivity Tool Steel for Press Hardening Tools
SP  - 497-504
AB  - High thermal conductivity HTCS (R) tool steels were developed by the company ROVALMA, S.A. in the years 2005-2006 in response to the new requirements demanded by tool steels for its use in the press hardening process. The HTCS (R) tool steels are characterized by their very high thermal conductivity values, which can reach up to 60 W/m.K, and their high hardenability, presenting hardness levels up to 60 HRc. Mentioned characteristics make these materials ideal for tools in the press hardening process. They allow increasing the productivity through reduction of the cycle time as well as increasing die durability through a high wear surface resistance, two major requirements the tool materials for this process are subjected to. The HTCS (R) tool steels respond to the requirements demanded by different press hardening processes and parameters, such as direct and indirect process, production of coated or uncoated sheet, tailored components, long or short series production, complex part geometries, etc. They have been successfully introduced to the market and are attracting the press hardening industry to an increasing extent. In this contribution, second generation HTCS (R) materials will be introduced presenting further increases of thermal conductivities at higher hardness levels, thereby providing increased wear resistance. These new materials provide furthermore advantages in the manufacturing of the tool considered that they can be supplied in a soft state for machining and that subsequently, only a nitriding treatment is necessary to increase the hardness of the base material to the very core up to 60 HRc and that of the surface to more than 1000 HV. This allows avoiding the hardening process and hard machining, saving time and significantly reducing the tool manufacturing costs, compared to die manufacturing with conventional tool steels. Thermal properties, hardness evolution through the nitriding process, and weldability, amongst others, have been evaluated.

VL  - 29

SP  - 635-645
AB  - Thermal stability of lysozyme in aqueous buffer solutions was studied at selected temperatures (73-100 degrees C), pH values (4.2-9.0) and levels of sucrose (0%, 5%, 15%) and sodium chloride (0, 0.1M, 1M). The results, fitted to a first-order model and expressed in terms of decimal reduction time (D), inactivation rate constant (k), decimal reduction temperature (z) and Arrhenius activation energy (E(a)) indicated that lysozyme was most stable at pH 5.2, and thermal stability decreased sharply as the pH increased to 9.0. A regression equation for prediction of k as a function of pH and temperature was derived, with the best fit obtained for the model in the pH range of 5.2-7.2 (adjusted multiple r(2)=0.98). At pH 7.2 and 9.0, sodium chloride had a clear stabilizing effect against heat inactivation of lysozyme. Sucrose stabilized lysozyme against heat inactivation at 75 degrees C but not at 91 degrees C. Thermal inactivation kinetics of lysozyme and its potential to prevent or delay microbial growth were investigated in beer. Lysozyme at concentrations of 10 and 50ppm appeared to delay growth of the spoilage bacteria L. brevis and P. damnosus in beer, but did not prevent growth of the bacteria.

TI  - Absorption line black body distribution function evaluated with proper orthogonal decomposition for mixture of CO2 and H2O
VL  - 24
IS  - 4
SP  - 932-948
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach of evaluation of the absorption line black body distribution function (ALBDF) for a mixture of gases. Currently published correlations, which are used to reproduce the ALBDF, treat only single gases. Design/methodology/approach - A discrete form of the ALBDF is generated using line by line (LBL) calculations. The latest spectroscopic database HITEMP 2010 is used for the generation of the absorption coefficient histogram, which is cumulated later in order to produce a tabulated form of the ALBDF. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) statistical method is employed for the reproduction of the ALBDF. Interpolation property of the POD allows to reproduce the ALBDF for arbitrary gas mixture parameters. Findings - POD proved to possess optimal interpolation properties. Results obtained by using POD are in very good agreement with LBL integration. Research limitations/implications - One have to be aware that the model generated with the POD method can be used only within the range of parameters used to build the model. The POD does not perform any property extrapolation. The model is limited to a mixture of two gases, namely CO2 and H2O. Expanding the number of gases used in the mixture may lead to a relatively large matrix system, which is difficult to process with the POD approach. Practical implications - The presented approach can be used to produce absorption coefficients values and their weights, which can be applied in the gas radiative properties description using the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGG) concept. The proposed model can be used with any radiative transfer equation solver which employs the WSGG approach. Originality/value - For the first time, radiative properties of gas mixtures are reproduced using the POD approach.

AB  - Despite the pressing need for accurate forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, commonly used modeling approaches exhibit mixed performance because they omit many important aspects of how organisms respond to spatially and temporally variable environments. Integrating models based on organismal phenotypes at the physiological, performance, and fitness levels can improve model performance. We summarize current limitations of environmental data and models and discuss potential remedies. The paper reviews emerging techniques for sensing environments at fine spatial and temporal scales, accounting for environmental extremes, and capturing how organisms experience the environment. Intertidal mussel data illustrate biologically important aspects of environmental variability. We then discuss key challenges in translating environmental conditions into organismal performance including accounting for the varied timescales of physiological processes, for responses to environmental fluctuations including the onset of stress and other thresholds, and for how environmental sensitivities vary across lifecycles. We call for the creation of phenotypic databases to parameterize forecasting models and advocate for improved sharing of model code and data for model testing. We conclude with challenges in organismal biology that must be solved to improve forecasts over the next decade.

TI  - FLUID-ABSENT MELTING BEHAVIOR OF AN F-RICH TONALITIC GNEISS AT MIDCRUSTAL PRESSURES - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GENERATION OF ANOROGENIC GRANITES
VL  - 34
IS  - 4
SP  - 785-815
AB  - Fluid-absent melting experiments on a biotite (20 wt.%) and hornblende (2 wt.%) bearing tonalitic gneiss were conducted at 6 kbar (900-975-degrees-C), 10 kbar (875-1075-degrees-C), and 14 kbar (950-975-degrees-C) to study melt productivity from weakly peraluminous quartzofeldspathic metamorphic rocks. At 6 kbar, biotite dehydration-melting is completed at 975-degrees-C via incongruent melting reactions that produce orthopyroxene, two oxides, and approximately 25 wt.% granitic melt. At 6 kbar, hornblende disappears at 900-degrees-C, probably in reaction with biotite. At 10 kbar, biotite dehydration-melting produces < 10 wt.% melt up to 950-degrees-C via incongruent melting reactions that produce orthopyroxene, garnet, and granitic melt. Hornblende disappears in the same temperature interval either by resorption or by reaction with biotite. Widespread biotite dehydration-melting occurs between 950 and 975-degrees-C and produces orthopyroxene, two oxides, and approximately 20 wt.% fluorine-rich (up to 0.31 wt.%) granitic melt. At 14 kbar only a trace of melt is present at 950-degrees-C, and the amounts of hornblende and biotite are virtually the same as in the starting material. At 975-degrees-C, hornblende is gone and approximately 10 wt.% granitic melt is produced by melting of both biotite and hornblende. Our results show that hornblende-bearing assemblages cannot go through dehydration-melting on their own (although they can in combination with biotite) if the Ca content in the source rock is too low to stabilize clinopyroxene. In such rocks, hornblende will either resorb or melt by reaction with biotite. Under fluid-absent conditions, intrusion of hot, mantle-derived magmas into the lower crust is necessary to initiate widespread dehydration-melting in rocks with compositions similar to those discussed here. We argue that the high thermal stability of biotite in our starting material is caused mainly by the incorporation of fluorine. The relatively high F content in biotite in the starting material (0.47 wt.%) suggests that the rock has experienced dehydroxylation in its past. F enrichment by a previous fluid-absent partial melting event is excluded because of the lack of phases such as orthopyroxene and garnet which would have been produced. Our experiments show that the dehydration-melting of such F-enriched biotite produces F-rich granitic liquids, with compositions within the range of A-types granites, and leaves behind a granulitic residue dominated by orthopyroxene, quartz, and plagioclase. This study therefore supports the notion that A-type granites can be generated by H2O-undersaturated melting of rocks of tonalitic composition (Creaser et al., 1991), but does not require that these source rocks should be residual after a previous melting event.

TI  - Optimization of hypochlorous acid generation by HCl electrolysis through response surface methodology and artificial neural networks
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
AB  - Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), also known as electrolyzed water (EW), is a sustainable and environment-friendly disinfectant, which can comply with food safety regulations. In this study, HOCl was produced through HCl electrolysis using an acrylic electrolyzing reactor without a diaphragm between iridium oxide electrodes coated with titanium. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was adopted to study the effects of feed water flow rate (FR), pH, temperature, electric voltage, acid concentration (AC), and acid dosing pump stroke (APS) on HOCl production measured as available chlorine concentration (ACC). Then, optimum parameters were explored using response surface methodology (RSM). The proposed quadratic models defined the relationship between HOCl production and the process variables. The models were statistically significant as shown by analysis of variance. The optimum operating parameters for HOCl production were 6.5 L/min, pH 7.5 at 20 degrees C, 3.8 volts, 6% AC, and APS at 3%. The FR, AC, and APS were significant parameters, and no substantial effect was observed for pH and temperature of feed water or the variation in current-voltage. High FR caused a conspicuous drop, and the high voltage showed a slight increase in ACC. However, an increase in AC and APS significantly enhanced the ACC, although the pH dropped below 5.0-6.5, indicating the presence of other chlorine-based compounds apart from HOCl. RSM model validation through experimental results indicated that the proposed model could effectively provide a relationship between ACC and process variables. Additionally, an artificial neural network model was tested to predict the ACC that showed good fitness to the experimental results.

TI  - Plagioclase Peridotites in Ocean-Continent Transitions: Refertilized Mantle Domains Generated by Melt Stagnation in the Shallow Mantle Lithosphere
VL  - 51
IS  - 1
SP  - 255-294
AB  - The existence of different mantle domains exposed in ocean-continent transition zones provides a framework for understanding the generation of ultramafic seafloor along magma-poor rifted margins. In this study we present detailed petrological and geochemical data on peridotites from the Eastern Central Alps ophiolites in Switzerland and Italy to identify different mantle domains, to estimate the extent of refertilization, and to test whether refertilization is associated with a thermal signature that has important implications for geophysical interpretations of ocean-continent transitions. The compositions of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and spinel clearly reflect the different mantle domains. Relative to clinopyroxenes from spinel peridotites, clinopyroxenes from plagioclase peridotites have lower Na2O and Sr contents, but higher middle to heavy rare earth element ratios and Zr concentrations, and different Sc-V relationships. Spinels in plagioclase peridotites have higher TiO2 and lower Mg-numbers compared with those in spinel peridotites. Mineral-mineral trace element partitioning suggests that spinel peridotites equilibrated at substantially lower temperatures than plagioclase peridotites. The temperature difference between the spinel and plagioclase peridotites indicates an important thermal boundary between the two. The geochemical data show systematic spatial variations. A heterogeneous, 'subcontinental domain' with no syn-rift melt imprint is separated from a 'refertilized domain' that exhibits a complex history of regional-scale melt infiltration and melt-rock reaction, which has erased most of the ancient history. Simple calculations suggest that up to 12% of mid-ocean ridge basalt-type melt can be stored in plagioclase peridotite, relative to a depleted residue. Such a 'lithospheric sponge' provides an explanation for the fertile compositions of the peridotites and the rare occurrence of volcanic rocks in magma-poor rifted margins. We suggest that magma-poor vs magma-rich margins are largely determined by the efficiency of melt extraction and not so much by melt generation processes, given a similar initial composition of the upwelling mantle. It is proposed that refertilization increases textural diversity and chemical heterogeneity related to shallow crystallization in the mantle lithosphere.

TI  - The nu MSM, leptonic asymmetries, and properties of singlet fermions
IS  - 8
AB  - We study in detail the mechanism of baryon and lepton asymmetry generation in the framework of the MSM (an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions with masses smaller than the electroweak scale). We elucidate the issue of CP-violation in the model and define the phase relevant for baryogenesis. We clarify the question of quantum-mechanical coherence, essential for the lepton asymmetry generation in singlet fermion oscillations and compute the relevant damping rates. The range of masses and couplings of singlet leptons which can lead to successful baryogenesis is determined. The conditions which ensure survival of primordial (existing above the electroweak temperatures) asymmetries in different leptonic numbers are analysed. We address the question whether CP-violating reactions with lepton number non-conservation can produce leptonic asymmetry below the sphaleron freeze-out temperature. This asymmetry, if created, leads to resonant production of dark matter sterile neutrinos. We show that the requirement that a significant lepton asymmetry be produced puts stringent constraints on the properties of a pair of nearly degenerate singlet fermions, which can be tested in accelerator experiments. In this region of parameters the.MSM provides a common mechanism for production of baryonic matter and dark matter in the universe. We analyse different fine-tunings of the model and discuss possible symmetries of the MSM Lagrangian that can lead to them.

TI  - An innovative dual fuel cell to capture and collect pure NOX from flue gases
VL  - 43
IS  - 10
SP  - 1011-1016
AB  - Nitrogen monoxide (NO), a major air pollutant, can be directly used as a precursor for nitrogen fertilizer production as long as it is collected in a pure form. In this study, an innovative dual fuel cell system was designed for the efficient capture and collection of pure NO (X) from industrial flue gases as well as for electricity generation. The system consisted of a methanol/ferric-EDTA fuel cell for NO (X) capture and a ferrous-EDTA-NO/air fuel cell for captured NO (X) collection. In a separation operation, the maximum power densities, which were obtained at pH 2 and 20 A degrees C, were 785 and 1,840 mW m(-2) in FC1 and FC2, respectively, and increased with temperature. The highest overall outputs from FC1 and FC2 were measured at pH 2, a result that is possibly attributable to the redox potential difference between the anolyte and catholyte in the fuel cells. In the combined operation, ferrous-EDTA-NO prepared in the cathode compartment of FC1 was successfully and efficiently converted to ferric-EDTA and NO in the anode compartment of FC2. The present approach was considered advantageous for advanced NO (X) reuse technology in the respect that valuable products, such as fertilizer, could be produced.

VL  - 47

SP  - 543-552
AB  - Successful biological control requires detailed knowledge about host preferences of the released parasitoid, because the presence of alternative hosts may affect the control of the target pest. The objective of this work was therefore to evaluate host preferences of Telenomus podisi Ashmead among the eggs of three stink bug species: Dichelops melacanthus Dallas, Euschistus heros Fabricius, and Podisus nigrispinus Dallas (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). Three independent experiments were carried out to study host preferences among the following: (1) E. heros, D. melacanthus dallas, and P. nigrispinus (bioassay 1); (2) E. heros and D. melacanthus (bioassay 2); and (3) D. melacanthus and P. nigrispinus (bioassay 3). A single bioassay (bioassay 4) was carried out to evaluate the egg size of E. heros, D. melacanthus, and P. nigrispinus. Two more bioassays were carried out: bioassay 5 to study the biological characteristics of T. podisi reared on E. heros, D. melacanthus, and P. nigrispinus eggs, and bioassay 6 to study the morphological characters of T. podisi reared on those different host eggs. Overall, T. podisi consistently preferred eggs of D. melacanthus to those of the other studied hosts, due to probably their better nutritional value; hypothesis that is supported by the fast T. podisi development and bigger parasitoids when reared on D. melacanthus and P. nigrispinus eggs. This allows suggesting that neither pre-imaginal conditioning nor associative learning nor alpha-conditioning are relevant to T. podisi parasitism. Thus, E. heros eggs could be successfully used for mass rearing of this parasitoid for successive generations since it would not affect its parasitism on other species of the Pentatomidae family in the field.

TI  - Biodegradability and kinetic studies on biomethane production from okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) waste
VL  - 115
IS  - 7
AB  - Emerging from the energy crisis of 2008 in South Africa, climate change concerns and the global desire to reduce high ozone-depleting emissions, renewable energy sources like biogas are gaining wide acceptance in most localities for heating and electricity. The paucity of feedstock varieties is a major challenge plaguing the sustainability of this sector. Biomethane potential, biodegradability and degradation kinetics of organic substrates are essential for assessing the suitability of feedstocks for methane generation and the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion process in biogas plants. Waste from the vegetable okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is a novel substrate; its biodegradability and degradation dynamics in biomethane production are largely unstudied, and were therefore the aims of this research. The substrate was digested for 25 days at the mesophilic condition and the biomethane potential data were recorded. Measured data of methane yield and the elemental composition of the substrate were used to fit five models (modified Gompertz, Stannard, transference function, logistic and first-order models) to predict degradation parameters and determine biodegradability of the substrate, respectively. Low lag phase (0.143 d), positive kinetic constant (0.2994/d) and the model fitness indicator (<10) showed that transference and first-order kinetic models predicted the methane yield better than did other growth functions. The experimental methane yield was 270.98 mL/gVS, theoretical methane yields were 444.48 mL/gVS and 342.06 mL/gVS and model simulation ranged from 267.5 mL/gVS to 270.89 mL/gVS. With a prediction difference of 0.03-1.28%, all growth functions acceptably predicted the kinetics of A. esculentus waste. The findings of this study offer information on this novel substrate important for its use in large-scale biogas production. Significance: Growing interest in biogas technology as an alternative energy source for both South African rural dwellers and industries, has mounted enormous pressure on known feedstocks, and instigated the search for novel substrates. Our study shows that okra waste is a viable feedstock for biogas production. The suitability of the first-order kinetic model over other models in predicting okra waste degradation was highlighted.

TI  - Are functional and demographic senescence genetically independent?
VL  - 41
IS  - 11
SP  - 1108-1116
AB  - Biogerontology has traditionally focused on demographic senescence by searching for environmental manipulations and genes that extend life span. Relatively little is known about age-specific changes in functional traits and how demographic and functional senescence are genetically (co)regulated. To determine whether functional and demographic senescence have a similar genetic basis, we measured genotypic variation in the age-related change in cold-stress resilience and age-specific mortality using ten inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold-stress resilience was measured as the average time for a population of flies to recover from a chill coma after being placed on melting ice for 6 h. We found genotypic variation in both sexes for chill-coma resilience, for the rate at which it declines with age, for longevity, for the initial mortality rate, and for the rate at which mortality increases with age. However, there was no genotypic correlation between any of these functional and demographic parameters. These results suggest that deterioration of at least some functional traits might be genetically independent of mortality patterns. Models for the genetic basis of senescence may do well to distinguish between quality and quantity of life in terms of their genetic architectures, and the way selection acts upon these two age-related factors.

AB  - To assess the relationship between productivity and office building design and operation, we analyzed the Building Assessment Survey Evaluation (BASE) data, a sample of 4,326 respondents in 100 randomly-selected U.S. office buildings. Associations were tested using proportional odds regression models and generalized estimating equations. Fifty-four percent of the respondents were defined as having high susceptibility (presence of doctor-diagnosed allergy, asthma or migraine), accounting for 71% of the 2,235 total lost days. We found. after adjustment for susceptibility and job dissatisfaction, significant association between lost days and the following workspace variables: crowdedness, any operable windows, more than 10 feet to a window, recent water damage within 15 feet of workstation, temperature above or below 72-73 degrees F. past fire damage, and recent renovations. Daily vacuuming vs. less frequent vacuuming was shown to be protective, as was bright light. Results underscore the importance of keeping an uncrowded, moisture-free, temperate, and clean workspace.

VL  - 40
SP  - 195-219
AB  - Subduction drives plate tectonics and builds continental crust, and as such is one of the most important processes for shaping the present-day Earth. Here we review both theory and observations for the viability and style of Archean subduction. High Archean mantle temperature gave low mantle viscosity and affected plate strength and plate buoyancy. This resulted in slower or intermittent subduction, either of which resulted in Earth cooling profiles that fit available data. Some geological observations are interpreted as subduction related, including an "arc" signature in various igneous rocks (suggesting burial of surface material to depths of 50-100 km), structural thrust belts and dipping seismic reflectors, and high-pressure-low-temperature and low-pressure-high-temperature paired metamorphic belts. Combined geo-dynamical and geochemical evidence suggests that subduction operated in the Archean, although not, as often assumed, as shallow flat subduction. Instead, subduction was more episodic in nature, with more intermittent plate motion than in the Phanerozoic.

TI  - The geopolitics of negative emissions technologies: learning lessons from REDD plus and renewable energy for afforestation, BECCS, and direct air capture
VL  - 4
AB  - Non-technical summary Negative emissions technologies (NETs) have received increasing interest in recent years as a potential part of a portfolio of measures to address anthropogenic climate change, in particular following the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C'. This increasing significance for global climate policy is faced with a multitude of open questions regarding, among others, the geopolitical implications of large-scale use of NETs. This paper outlines what we can learn for the possible geopolitical futures of NETs from existing international 'green' approaches. Technical summary We contribute to assessing political implications of NET scenarios, addressing the following question: What are potential geopolitical challenges, conflicts, and consequences of a large-scale deployment of three NETs, namely afforestation, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCS)? We turn to the two cases of renewable energies and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation for answers. We find that, first, not only afforestation, but also BECCS and even DACCS would have a geopolitical impact due to their requirements of territory - in the latter two cases, for instance, due to requirements for appropriate carbon storage space. Second, the material requirements of various NETs might also impact geopolitical constellations and induce conflict, providing certain countries and regions of the world with new leverage in the case of large-scale deployment, for instance those which can provide raw materials for fertilizer (for afforestation and BECCS) or energy generation (for DACCS). Third, discursive construction of space and identity might lead to very interesting new patterns of contestation, for instance if specific nation-states can successfully construct an identity of front-running climate protectors and use this to put pressure on other states.

AB  - Purpose Napier grass, one of the high yield perennial energy crops can be grown on marginal lands with minimal inputs, but with increased soil carbon sequestration in the southeastern US. The sustainable use of Napier grass for bioenergy applications such as combined heat and power at low cost to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions needs to be investigated. Methods In this study, an integrated life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis approach were used to estimate the energy use, environmental emissions, and minimum selling price (MSP) of electricity and thermal heat produced from Napier grass and compared with a coal or natural gas-fired combined heat and power generation plant. Results and discussion The use of Napier grass as a feedstock decreased the global warming potential (GWP) of the medium-sized CHP (i.e., 13 MWe) plant by 73-92 % compared to that of a coal and natural gas-fired CHP plants. Other environmental impacts were also reduced by 24-100 %. Eutrophication was the only impact comparable to that of the coal-fired CHP plant. The energy return on investment (EROI) was around 5:1. The minimum selling price of electricity generated from the CHP plant was US$0.05-0.4 MJ(e)(-1) (US$0.13-0.18 kWh(-1)) considering the credits for steam production, renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC), and carbon footprint from the fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Conclusions Although the pelleting of Napier grass for the CHP plant increased the cost and GHG emissions by 38% and 55% over the non-pelleted system, the pelleting process can ensure consistent quality and uninterrupted supply of the feedstock for heat and power generation.

TI  - Host-parasite dynamics shaped by temperature and genotype: Quantifying the role of underlying vital rates
VL  - 36

SP  - 485-499
AB  - Global warming challenges the persistence of local populations, not only through heat-induced stress, but also through indirect biotic changes. We study the interactive effects of temperature, competition and parasitism in the water flea Daphnia magna. We carried out a common garden experiment monitoring the dynamics of Daphnia populations along a temperature gradient. Halfway through the experiment, all populations became infected with the ectoparasite Amoebidium parasiticum, enabling us to study the interactive effects of temperature and parasite dynamics. We combined Integral Projection Models with epidemiological models, parameterized using the experimental data on the performance of individuals within dynamic populations. This enabled us to quantify the contribution of different vital rates and epidemiological parameters to population fitness across temperatures and Daphnia clones originating from two latitudes. Interactions between temperature and parasitism shaped competition, where Belgian clones performed better under infection than Norwegian clones. Infected Daphnia populations performed better at higher than at lower temperatures, mainly due to an increased host capability of reducing parasite loads. Temperature strongly affected individual vital rates, but effects largely cancelled out on a population-level. In contrast, parasitism strongly reduced fitness through consistent negative effects on all vital rates. As a result, temperature-mediated parasitism was more important than the direct effects of temperature in shaping population dynamics. Both the outcome of the competition treatments and the observed extinction patterns support our modelling results. Our study highlights that shifts in biotic interactions can be equally or more important for responses to warming than direct physiological effects of warming, emphasizing that we need to include such interactions in our studies to predict the competitive ability of natural populations experiencing global warming.

AB  - There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log((W) over bar), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G = E[log((W) over bar) + U +S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log((W) over bar) + U + S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.

TI  - Food Waste Valorisation for Biogas-Based Bioenergy Production in Circular Bioeconomy: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Developments
VL  - 10
AB  - The fossil fuel-based linear economy has inherent intricacies such as environmental pollution and the continued need for energy sourcing. Consequently, there has been a shift to a more sustainable circular bio-economy, in which biomass waste is valorised for energy generation while reducing the bulk waste materials and greenhouse gas emissions. In modern bioeconomy, biogas is a primary energy production vehicle. Bio-based economy-enabled technologies result in heat and electricity generation, considerable substitution of fossil fuels for transport, and also the manufacture of additional value-added products and byproducts of economic benefits. Wastes from industrial operations, agriculture, and other anthropogenic activities such as food waste (FW) can be biodigested and transformed into valuable energy sources, nutrient-rich manure, and speciality chemicals. However, for instance, although closed anaerobic membrane bioreactors can totally avoid a microbial runoff, membrane fouling frequently affects the hydraulic performance. Recent developments in anaerobic digestion (AD) of FW have diversified into pretreatment, organic loading, additive supplementation, parametric optimisation, and digestate recirculation to enhance the utility potential of biomass for energy and environment. These numerous anaerobic and microbial interventions support biomass valorisation and related processes, resulting in more efficient biomethanation. Valorisation of FW through biogas-based energy production could serve as an essential cog in the wheel of a circular bioeconomy.

AB  - China has a wetland area of 53.42 million hectares, the fourth largest in the world; it includes all types of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention and has a carbon sink capacity of more than 1.71 million metric tons per year. Inland wetlands in China are mainly distributed in 10 major catchments, among which the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the rivers in the northwest, and the rivers in the northeast each have more than 8 million hectares of wetlands. There are 4220 species of plants and 4015 species of animals in China's wetland ecosystem. The wetland resources that have been developed and utilized include edible products, reeds for paper making, peat for fertilizer, fuel for power generation, and chemical, pharmaceutical, ceramic, and building materials. However, wetland areas in China have shrunk by about 54% since 1980. In recent years, China's central government has set great store by Chinese wetlands, and although 49.03% of wetland area is now officially protected, many issues have confounded the implementation of that protection. It is imperative that knowledge gained from scientific research be used to formulate a sound wetland protection and management plan that takes into consideration social, economic, and ecological issues in a way that facilitates the sustainable use of wetland resources and informs decision-makers of the paths that must be followed to achieve that goal.

TI  - Theoretical and experimental demonstration of lignite chemical looping gasification of phosphogypsum oxygen carrier for syngas generation
VL  - 194
SP  - 448-459
AB  - Phosphogypsum (PG) is a by-product in the phosphate fertilizer industry, and low rank coal-lignite has high moisture which seriously influence its direct use. As a promising raw material for chemical industry, syngas can be obtained through a properly designed lignite Chemical Looping Gasification (CLG) of PG oxygen carrier. The understanding of the reaction mechanism has been developed, while optimal conditions have been investigated. The study found that the product of syngas mainly comes from the solid solid and gas-solid reactions, while the consumption of syngas mainly takes place via gas-solid reaction. Additionally, the effects of several reaction conditions on the production of syngas have also been analyzed. The optimum values of these reaction conditions are found to be as follows: the PG/lignite molar ratio (X) should be about 0.2; reaction temperature should be over 1123 K; 40-140 mesh size particles should be used. Meanwhile, the crystallization and properties of used phosphogypsum have been studied using X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The results suggested that calcium sulfate was almost completely converted to CaS at a temperature higher than 1123 K, while the sintering of used PG particles can take place for 140 mesh and 200 mesh sizes.

TI  - Lightweight mirror technology using a thin facesheet with active rigid support
VL  - 3356
SP  - 690-701
AB  - The next generation of space telescopes will require primary mirrors that push beyond the current state of technology for mirror fabrication. These mirrors are large, up to 8 meters in diameter, have low mass per unit area, less than 15 kg/m(2) and must maintain diffraction limited performance at cryogenic temperatures. To meet these requirements, we have developed an active mirror that has a thin membrane as the optical surface, which is attached to a stiff lightweight support structure through a set of screw-type actuators. This system allows periodic adjustments with the actuators to maintain the surface figure as measured from star light. The optical surface accuracy and stability are maintained by the active system, so the support structure does not have to be optically stable and can be made using light weight carbon fiber laminates to economically provide stiffness. The key technologies for implementing this technology are now in place. We have performed two critical demonstrations using 2-mm glass membranes - diffraction limited optical performance of a 0.5-m diameter mirror and launch survival of a I-m diameter mirror. We have also built and tested a prototype actuator that achieves 25 nm resolution at cryogenic temperatures. We are now building a 2-m mirror as a prototype for the Next Generation Space Telescope. This mirror will have mass of only 40 kg, including support structure, actuators, and control electronics. It will be will be actively controlled and interferometrically measured at 35 K.

TI  - Determination of the Loss Behavior and the Heat Balance of Rolling Bearings
VL  - 2308
IS  - 2
SP  - 149-155
AB  - Rolling bearings play an important role in the design of gear transmissions. For a successful process, the best type and size of the rolling bearings has to be defined in an early stage of development. However, high operational reliability and economic viability depends on durability, as well as on the frictional and temperature behavior of the rolling bearings. Practical methods to calculate the loss torque of rolling bearings according to the state of the art partly show significant differences among each other. In addition, the calculated loss torques frequently show high deviations compared to measured values in practice. Thus, comprehensive experimental investigations at the FZG bearing power loss test rig have been carried out in a collective FVA research project investigating the losses and temperatures of rolling bearings. In this paper, the principle of the FZG bearing power loss test rig is shown and selected results of the experimental investigations are compared to the calculation methods according to state of the art. Finally, measures for an improved estimation of the loss torque of rolling bearings are given.

TI  - Development of Technologies for Local Composting of Food Waste from Universities
VL  - 17
IS  - 9
AB  - The amount of biowaste generated by university canteens (BWUC) in the faculties of the University of A Coruna (UDC) varies between 6 and 100 kg/day. In addition, the gardening services of the campus generate even higher amounts of garden waste (GrW), including pruning, which, once crushed, serves as bulking material for composting the biowaste from the canteens. Decentralized composting has been chosen with the aim of producing high quality organic fertilizers for university urban gardens while reducing the environmental burdens of both waste management and agricultural practice. Small static home composters of 340 L (SHC) for smaller amounts of generation (up to 20 kg BWUC/day) were used, while, for faculties of higher generation (up to 40 kg BWUC/day on average), the first composting stage was carried out in a closed and dynamic composter (DC). The dynamic composter was designed and built specifically for this project and its features were improved and optimized throughout the study. The pilot project was carried out in two centers of the UDC, which are known as the Philology Faculty (PF) and the School of Architecture (SA). All the organic waste generated by the canteens of these two colleges from January 2011 to July 2011 (approximately 3000 kg) was treated. Composting in SHC included a thermophilic phase that extended one month beyond the loading period for which thermophilic temperatures were also recorded. The use of the DC as the first stage in combination with static composters (SC) for the maturation stage reduced the overall thermophilic phase to 6-8 weeks. The complete maturation (Rottegrade class IV-V) was achieved after about four months in SHC and after two months when using the combined DC-SC system, if the right conditions of moisture were maintained. The chemical quality of the compost produced was compatible with Class A of Spanish legislation (equivalent to organic farmer quality) and the C/N ratio ranged from 9 to 15 depending on the relation BWUC:GrW.

TI  - A model of debonding instability for solid propellant rocket motor .1. Uniform longitudinal and transverse stress rate
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 93-113
AB  - The interface between a soft and a hard material is vulnerable to debonding because of the prevailing high stress gradient that could be further aggravated under dynamic transient conditions. Such a situation is common in a solid-fuel rocket motor where unstable debonding could be triggered from the initiation of a macrocrack near the interface. The transition from a survival state to a failure state requires knowledge of how the nonlinear, dissipative and nonhomogeneous effects of the dissimilar material interface would interact with load. The solid-fuel rocket motor problem is modeled by a three-layered composite system made of steel, adhesive and rubber under plane extension. Assessed are the time dependent nonhomogeneous deformation and possible failure modes. Only initial properties of the materials were used to determine the evolution of nonequilibrium response. This is made possible by application of the isoenergy density theory that accounts for internal heat generation and energy dissipation effects. Results are presented in two parts. In Part I, the applied stress rates are assumed to be 0.75 ksi/s in both the longitudinal and transverse direction while Part II assumes different stress rates in these two directions. At approximately one second after loading, a slanted but straight: macrocrack of about 5 x 10(-3) in. is predicted to occur in the rubber next to the interface. This initial crack was found to become unstable at eight seconds and was estimated to be close to the adhesive/rubber interface over a length of 1.88 in. The onset of fracture depended directly on the load transient behavior.

TI  - Thinning of continental backarc lithosphere by flow-induced gravitational instability
VL  - 269
IS  - 3
SP  - 435-446
AB  - Many continental backarcs have thin (similar to 60 km) lithosphere for 100s of km behind the volcanic arc even where, there has been no significant extension. One mechanism to produce thin backarc lithosphere is through gravitational thinning of normal thickness lithosphere by subduction-related mantle flow. The stability of backarc mantle lithosphere is examined using thermal-mechanical models of subduction of an oceanic plate beneath continental lithosphere with an initial thickness of 120 km and a thermal structure similar to average Phanerozoic continental lithosphere. Subduction-induced mantle flow shears the base of the backarc lithosphere producing lateral density perturbations. Owing to the non-Newtonian lithosphere rheology, shearing also reduces the effective viscosity of the lowermost lithosphere, enabling the density perturbations to become gravitationally unstable. The perturbations develop into rapidly-growing downwellings which result in removal of lower backarc lithosphere on timescales of 5-10 Ma. Conductive heating and shearing of the remaining lithosphere results in a second, more muted, phase of gravitational instability and thinning. Lower lithosphere instability is enhanced by higher subduction rates, weaker intrinsic rheology, higher compositional density, and hotter initial thermal structure. The numerical model results are in good agreement with a buoyancy stability analysis, which includes the vertical gradients in temperature and strain rate through the lithosphere. As both rheology and density depend on lithosphere composition, significant thinning may be restricted to continental mantle lithosphere that is fertile and contains a small amount of water. To produce a final thickness comparable to that observed without lithospheric contraction OF extension, it is necessary to have a weak lithosphere rheology, an initial thermal structure hotter than average Phanerozoic continental geotherms, or a combination of the two. The region of thin lithosphere at the northern Cascadia backarc coincides with terranes that were accreted to the North American craton. The known fertile composition of the backarc lithosphere may allow it to be thinned, while the drier, more refractory craton lithosphere is resistant to thinning. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Improved Phosphorus Recycling in Organic Farming: Navigating Between Constraints
VL  - 147
SP  - 159-237
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for all living organisms. At the current rate of extraction, global reserves of mineable deposits will be exhausted within the next few centuries. This publication aims to summarize the current knowledge on P recycling for organic farming. The evaluation of recycled P fertilizers (RPFs) includes (i) a chemical characterization, (ii) assessment of their plant P availability and added effects in the soil, (iii) life cycle assessments, (iv) a risk assessment of their long-term impacts on soil pollution, and (v) the compilation of other environmental impacts of different treatment approaches to produce RPFs. The highest nutrient recovery rates for P are achieved by rather simple process approaches of P recycling, while more sophisticated approaches often result in lower P recovery rates (e.g., chemical approaches for P precipitation), lower plant P availability in the final product (e.g., most thermal approaches), and losses of organic matter and nutrients like nitrogen and sulfur (e.g., thermal approaches). The plant P availability of many RPFs is higher than that of phosphate rock. Each P recycling approach has strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that any decision not to use a potential recycled P source or to introduce sophisticated treatments may have consequences compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Nevertheless, we need to minimize risks for current and future generations caused by contamination linked to fertilization. Therefore, any management of nutrient recycling requires navigation between constraints. The challenge for the organic agriculture sector is to assess RPFs using a balanced approach that compromises neither the principle of ecology nor the principle of care.

VL  - 676
SP  - 198-210
AB  - Following previous work on the Colorado Basin using a 3D crustal structural model, we now investigate the presence of lower crustal bodies at the base of the crust using 3D lithospheric gravity, modelling and calculations of the conductive thermal field. Our first study highlighted two fault directions and depocentres associated with thinned crust (NW-SE in the West and NE-SW at the distal margin). Fault relative chronology argues for two periods of extension: (1) NW-SE faulting and thinning in the western Colorado Basin and (2) NE-SW faulting and thinning related to the continental breakup and formation of the NE-SW-striking volcanic margins of the Atlantic Ocean. In this study, the geometry of modelled high-density Lower Crustal Bodies (LCBs) enables the reproduction of the gravimetric field as well as of the temperature measured in wells down to 4500 m. The modelled LCBs correlate with geological observations: (1) NW-SE LCBs below the deepest depocentres in the West, (2) NE-SW LCBs below the distal margin faults and the seaward dipping reflectors. Thus the proposed poly-phased evolution of the margin could as well correspond to two emplacement phases of the LCBs. The calculated conductive thermal field fits the measured temperatures best if the thermal properties (thermal conductivity and radiogenic heat production) assigned to the LCBs correspond to either high-grade metamorphic rocks or to mafic magmatic intrusions. To explain the possible lithology of the LCBs, we propose that the two successive phases of extension are accompanied by magma supply, emplaced (1) in the thinnest crust below the older NW-SE depocentres, then (2) along the NE-SW continentward boundary of the distal margin and below the volcanic seaward dipping reflectors. The South African conjugate margin records only the second NE-SW event and we discuss hypotheses which could explain these differences between the conjugate margins.

AB  - Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles were the most prominent, abrupt climate events of the last glacial period whose impact was most strongly felt in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic region. The climate links between the North Atlantic, the Asian and American tropics, and Antarctica during these cycles are well documented. However, the potential role of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and Australasian monsoon system in propagating climate impacts across the hemispheres is still unclear. Here, we use tandem measurements of oxygen isotopes in calcite and fluid inclusions, as well as carbon-isotope ratios, from multiple stalagmites from Liang Luar Cave, Flores (southern Indonesia) to examine the monsoon response to D-O event number 21 (similar to 87,000-84,000 years ago), the longest and warmest event recorded in Greenland ice cores. The record shows that there was a rapid decline in monsoon rainfall in Indonesia during D-O21 warming in Greenland and cooling in Antarctica. At around the same time, the East Asian monsoon was intensified, indicating that the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shifted abruptly to the north during this event. Our record also shows that there was a 2-3 degrees C increase in local air temperature, which would have acted to increase primary productivity and promote the generation of soil carbon for methanogenesis. Therefore, our findings indicate that ITCZ positioning in tropical Australasia-through its influence on large-scale oceanic-atmospheric circulation-played a key role in transmitting the abrupt climate signal between the hemispheres, thereby facilitating the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations during D-O21 that ultimately led to global warming and the demise of the MIS5b stadial.

TI  - Thermal conditions during heat waves of a mid-European metropolis under consideration of climate change, urban development scenarios and resilience measures for the mid-21st century
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
AB  - In this study we produce two urban development scenarios estimating potential urban sprawl and optimized development concerning building construction, and we simulate their inf uence on air temperature, surface temperatures and human thermal comfort. We select two heat waves representative for present and future conditions of the mid 21st century and simulations are run with the Town Energy Balance Model (TEB) coupled online and offlin to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). Global and regional climate change under the RCP8.5 scenario causes an increase of daily maximum air temperature in Vienna by 7 K. The daily minimum air temperature will increase by 2-4 K. Changes caused by urban growth or densificati n mainly affect air temperature and human thermal comfort locally where new urbanisation takes place and does not occur significa tly in the central districts. A combination of near zero-energy standards and increasing albedo of building materials on the city scale accomplishes a maximum reduction of urban canyon temperature achieved by changes in urban parameters of 0.9 K for the minima and 0.2 K for the maxima. Local scale changes of different adaptation measures show that insulation of buildings alone increases the maximum wall surface temperatures by more than 10 K or the maximum mean radiant temperature (MRT) in the canyon by 5 K. Therefore, measures to reduce MRT within the urban canyons like tree shade are needed to complement the proposed measures. This study concludes that the rising air temperatures expected by climate change puts an unprecedented heat burden on Viennese inhabitants, which cannot easily be reduced by measures concerning buildings within the city itself. Additionally, measures such as planting trees to provide shade, regional water sensitive planning and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce temperature extremes are required.

TI  - Fermentation-based nanoparticle systems for sustainable conversion of black-liquor into biohydrogen
VL  - 309
AB  - Paper-manufacturing industries utilize rice straw (RS) as raw material, generating huge quantity of black liquor (BL), which should be treated before reaching the environment. BL is mainly rich in organic pollutants that can be utilized to obtain valuable by-products and meet sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this investigation, BL from a paper-making industry was efficiently employed as a substrate for bio-H-2 generation via dark fermentation at pH value of 7.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C for 14 days, resulting in a hydrogen yield (HY) of 0.579 mol/mol(glucose). The HY was substantially increased up to 1.654, 1.908, and 2.187 mol/mol(glucose) with immobilization of anaerobes on Graphene (GN), hydroxyapatite (HN), and Graphene/hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (GHN). Further, the activities of protein- and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes i.e. protease, alpha-amylase, xylanase, and CM-cellulase was highly improved. Results were validated with respect to the operational tax-onomical unit (OUT) richness estimators (ACE and Chao), diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson), and electron-equivalent and mass balances. The H-2 productivity data were techno-economically assessed for proposing a bioenergy-based project, revealing a payback period of 5.92 y to recoup the initial investment. The findings of this study would promote interaction in the areas of industrialization, pollution prevention, and clean energy production to attain SDGs keys.

TI  - Warming Strengthens the Ecological Role of Intraspecific Variation in a Predator
VL  - 105
IS  - 3
SP  - 523-532
AB  - Recent work shows communities and ecosystems can be shaped by predator intraspecific variation, but it is unclear whether the magnitude and direction of these influences are context-dependent. Temperature is an environmental context of strong ecological influence and widespread relevance given global warming trends. Warming should increase per capita predator effects on prey through increases in predator metabolic rate, potentially exacerbating intraspecific differences in ecological effects. Here, we used two populations of the potent pelagic freshwater predator, WesternMosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), to test how experimental pond temperature mediates the differences between their ecological impacts. Mosquitofish introduction induced a strong pelagic trophic cascade, causing a large reduction of crustacean zooplankton biomass, an increase in phytoplankton biomass, and changes to ecosystem-level response variables. Warming (+/- 28 degrees C above unwarmed treatments) exacerbated fish-induced reduction of zooplankton biomass, but moderated the cascade to phytoplankton, primary productivity, and nutrient concentrations. Effects of intraspecific variation were apparent only on zooplankton, and only at warmed environmental temperatures. The traits underlying this divergence may be related to the population source thermal environments. Overall, results show that warming may increase the ecological importance of predator intraspecific variation. In general, extrinsic environmental drivers, such as those associated with climate change, may reshape the effects of intraspecific trait variation on ecosystems.

VL  - 111

SP  - 579-584
AB  - Temperature is one of the main factors affecting insect growth, development and reproduction. The effects of temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on the development and reproduction of Cinara cedri Mimeur (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea: Lachnidae) fed on Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) G. Don were evaluated in this study. With the increase of temperature from 10 to 30 degrees C, the development duration at different development stages gradually shortened. There was a significant positive correlation between the developmental rates and temperature, following a quadratic regression model. The lower developmental threshold temperature (C) and effective accumulated temperatures (K) for completing a generation were 4.13 degrees C and 263.4 degree-days, respectively. The highest fecundity was observed at 20 degrees C with 25.74 first-instar nymphs/female. Both the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r, 0.11 +/- 0.03) and net reproduction rate (R-0, 19.06 +/- 2.05) were observed at 20 degrees C, whereas the lowest values of r (0.05 +/- 0.01) at 10 degrees C and R-0 (5.78 +/- 0.88) at 30 degrees C were observed. The results suggest that temperature significantly affects the biology of C. cedri and the optimal temperature for its development is 20 degrees C.

VL  - 27
IS  - 10
SP  - 2381-2396
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity occurs at a variety of timescales, but little is known about the degree to which plastic responses at different timescales are associated with similar underlying molecular processes, which is critical for assessing the effects of plasticity on evolutionary trajectories. To address this issue, we identified differential gene expression in response to developmental temperature in the muscle transcriptome of adult threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exposed to 12, 18 and 24 degrees C until hatch and then held at 18 degrees C for 9months and compared these results to differential gene expression in response to adult thermal acclimation in stickleback developed at 18 degrees C and then acclimated to 5 and 25 degrees C as adults. Adult thermal acclimation affected the expression of 7,940 and 7,015 genes in response to cold and warm acclimation, respectively, and 4,851 of these genes responded in both treatments. In contrast, the expression of only 33 and 29 genes was affected by cold and warm development, respectively. The majority of the genes affected by developmental temperature were also affected by adult acclimation temperature. Many genes that were differentially expressed as a result of adult acclimation were associated with previously identified temperature-dependent effects on DNA methylation patterns, suggesting a role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression plasticity during acclimation. Taken together, these results demonstrate similarities between the persistent effects of developmental plasticity on gene expression and the effects of adult thermal acclimation, emphasizing the potential for mechanistic links between plasticity acting at these different life stages.

VL  - 37
SP  - 243-248
AB  - The voracity of larvae of Melangyna viridiceps and Symosyrphus grandicornis fed on the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae (L.), was measured at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Over the three larval instars, a lifetime total of about 300 aphids (third-instar equivalents) was consumed for a weight gain of 20 mg. Lifetime consumption was greater at lower temperatures. At 20 degrees C, the third-instar larva ate about 80% of the total, although this instar accounted for only 50% of larval development time. Melangyna viridiceps consumed more aphids than Symosyrphus grandicornis at 10 and 15 degrees C, Development of eggs, larvae and pupae of both species was studied at constant temperatures of 4, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Although eggs hatched at 4 degrees C, first-instar larvae died at this temperature. A computer program (PMDS) was used to fit temperature/development functions for all stages. Linear, LoganT(b), Stinner and exponential functions were fitted to the data. A day-degree program, using the parameters given by PMDS and records of daily maximum-minimum temperatures and data obtained from the field, suggested that the hoverflies might go through 10-13 generations per year in the field.

TI  - Adaptation, migration or extirpation: climate change outcomes for tree populations
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
SP  - 95-111
AB  - Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.

VL  - 50
IS  - 6
SP  - 1400-1406
AB  - Understanding cues for diapause termination in insects can be valuable in predicting phenological events in their lifecycles. Once identified, such cues can be utilized as a biofix, the point at which the majority of individuals within a population begin to accumulate degree days. We investigated the impact of photoperiod on completion of reproductive diapause in the invasive eastern North American population of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), by exposing diapausing females to varying light regimes in otherwise identical environments. The critical photoperiod estimated to initiate reproductive development in at least 50% of the potential reproductive population was 13.0-13.5 h, with increasing photoperiods coinciding with increased probability of females reproducing, earlier time to first oviposition, and higher rates of fecundity. These data on the species' response to photoperiod are in agreement with previous modeling that predicted the twin constraints of photoperiod and temperature on H. halys reproduction prevents populations that undergo diapause from producing more than two generations annually anywhere within the continental U.S. However, the facultative nature of diapause in H. halys leaves open the possibility that sub-populations may not enter diapause in some conditions, potentially allowing for additional annual generations.

TI  - Is the life cycle of high arctic aphids adapted to climate change?
VL  - 31
IS  - 9
SP  - 1037-1042
AB  - The high arctic aphid Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum Heikinheimo is endemic to Svalbard and has developed a shortened life cycle to cope with harsh environmental conditions prevailing in this archipelago. Previous studies in the 1990s showed that contrarily to Sitobion calvulum, a species which is also restricted to Svalbard and displays a two-generation life cycle, A. svalbardicum can produce a third generation that, on average, should complete its development and reproduction once every 28 years. Because temperature has risen substantially in Svalbard during the past 10 -15 years and is predicted to rise further, budget requirements for this extra-generation should be met more and more frequently and the impact of the resulting demographic increase should be easily measurable in field populations of A. svalbardicum. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing a series of experiments designed to study population dynamics and morph production of A. svalbardicum. Surprisingly, the three-generation life cycle was not detected either in field populations surveyed for two consecutive years or in controlled conditions where temperature was manipulated. Although we cannot reject the possibility that A. svalbardicum populations may develop a three-generation life cycle under certain circumstances, this strategy seems very rare and not adaptive as it would have been selected in the recent years of warming observed in Svalbard.

TI  - Mucosa-interfacing electronics
AB  - The surface mucosa that lines many of our organs houses myriad biometric signals and, therefore, has great potential as a sensor-tissue interface for high-fidelity and long-term biosensing. However, progress is still nascent for mucosa-interfacing electronics owing to challenges with establishing robust sensor-tissue interfaces; device localization, retention and removal; and power and data transfer. This is in sharp contrast to the rapidly advancing field of skin-interfacing electronics, which are replacing traditional hospital visits with minimally invasive, real-time, continuous and untethered biosensing. This Review aims to bridge the gap between skin-interfacing electronics and mucosa-interfacing electronics systems through a comparison of the properties and functions of the skin and internal mucosal surfaces. The major physiological signals accessible through mucosa-lined organs are surveyed and design considerations for the next generation of mucosa-interfacing electronics are outlined based on state-of-the-art developments in bio-integrated electronics. With this Review, we aim to inspire hardware solutions that can serve as a foundation for developing personalized biosensing from the mucosa, a relatively uncharted field with great scientific and clinical potential. The surface mucosa that lines many of our organs hosts a diverse set of biometric signals. This Review compares present skin-interfacing and mucosa-interfacing electronics to inspire hardware solutions for developing devices for personalized biosensing from the mucosa.

TI  - Climate change: a crop protection challenge for the twenty-first century
VL  - 67
IS  - 6
SP  - 691-696
AB  - Convincing data now show that temperatures are increasing, and that changing precipitation patterns are already affecting agriculture. Predicted future impacts vary by region, but all are projected to suffer productivity declines by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measures are implemented soon. Exacerbating the climate change challenge, doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century. Clearly, crop protection will become increasingly difficult as higher-yielding varieties present a larger and more tempting target to all pests, and the pests themselves extend their ranges poleward and into other new geographies owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing seasons. Fortunately, good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenges is already being made, but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option. Increased investment into new technologies and adoption of new agricultural practices with improved adaptive and mitigation potential are both essential. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

VL  - 570
SP  - 71-85
AB  - The 1998 and 2016 thermal anomalies were among the 2 most severe global-scale anomalies in recent history, with broad-scale impacts on reef condition. In 2 Kenyan fully protected national park reef lagoons, the water flow, light, and temperature exposure severity of these 2 events was grossly similar at 7.3 cm s(-1), similar to 50 Einsteins m(-2) d(-1) and similar to 85 degree-days above summer baseline. Yet, despite similarities in the coral communities' metrics over this time, the bleaching responses were diminished considerably across this 17 yr period. For example, the numbers of pale and bleached colonies declined from 73 to 27% and from 96 to 60% in the low and high thermal exposure reefs, respectively. A metric that weights bleaching by the intensity of the response and the number of individuals of each taxon also found a decline from 35 to 10% and from 65 to 33%. Of the 21 most common coral taxa, 11, including major contributors to coral cover such as Porites and Acropora, showed declines in their sensitivity. Ten taxa, including Montipora and Pocillopora, showed either little or weak evidence for change in sensitivity, and 1 taxon, Acanthastrea, was more sensitive to the exposure in 2016 than in 1998. Sampling limitations and qualitative differences in the pre-peak temperature conditions did not allow separating the influences of genetic adaptation, acclimatization, and community change.

AB  - Evolutionary physiology represents an explicit fusion of two complementary approaches: evolution and physiology. Stimulated by four major intellectual and methodological developments (explicit consideration of diverse evolutionary mechanisms, phylogenetic approaches, incorporation of the perspectives and tools of evolutionary genetics and selection studies, and generalization of molecular techniques to exotic organisms), this field achieved prominence during the past decade. It addresses three major questions regarding physiological evolution: (a) What are the historical, ecological, and phylogenetic patterns of physiological evolution? (b) How important are and were each of the known evolutionary processes (natural selection, sexual selection, drift, constraint, genetic coupling/hitchhiking, and others) in engendering or Limiting physiological evolution? and(c) How do the genotype, phenotype, physiological performance, and fitness interact in influencing one another's future values? To answer these questions, evolutionary physiology examines extant and historical variation and diversity, standing genetic and phenotypic variability in populations, and past and ongoing natural selection in the wild. Also, it manipulates genotypes, phenotypes, and environments of evolving populations in the laboratory and field. Thus, evolutionary physiology represents the infusion of paradigms, techniques, and approaches of evolutionary biology, genetics, and systematics into physiology. The reciprocal infusion of physiological approaches into evolutionary biology and systematics can Likewise have great value and is a future goal.

TI  - Future Climate Change Impacts on European Viticulture: A Review on Recent Scientific Advances
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
AB  - Climate change is a continuous spatiotemporal reality, possibly endangering the viability of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) in the future. Europe emerges as an especially responsive area where the grapevine is largely recognised as one of the most important crops, playing a key environmental and socio-economic role. The mounting evidence on significant impacts of climate change on viticulture urges the scientific community in investigating the potential evolution of these impacts in the upcoming decades. In this review work, a first attempt for the compilation of selected scientific research on this subject, during a relatively recent time frame (2010-2020), is implemented. For this purpose, a thorough investigation through multiple search queries was conducted and further screened by focusing exclusively on the predicted productivity parameters (phenology timing, product quality and yield) and cultivation area alteration. Main findings on the potential impacts of future climate change are described as changes in grapevine phenological timing, alterations in grape and wine composition, heterogeneous effects on grapevine yield, the expansion into areas that were previously unsuitable for grapevine cultivation and significant geographical displacements in traditional growing areas. These compiled findings may facilitate and delineate the implementation of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, ultimately potentiating the future sustainability of European viticulture.

TI  - Bacterial dormancy: A subpopulation of viable but non-culturable cells demonstrates better fitness for revival
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Author summary Members of the Proteobacteria are reported to adopt a survival strategy and enter a viable but non culturable (VBNC) state, when exposed to stressful or non-permissible growth conditions. This is a characteristic employed widely in the natural environment in order for bacteria to survive harsh environmental conditions over a long period. In spite of the importance of the VBNC state in microbiology, we know little about the molecular makeup of VBNC cells. In this study, using the model organism Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we resolved that distinct subpopulations of bacteria exist in the VBNC state and these have different resuscitation potentials and distinct proteomic profiles. We also discovered that deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (lldD) triggered the cells to enter the VBNC state, and adding lactate to VBNC cells extended their resuscitation potential window. The ability for bacteria to survive in the VBNC state might be linked to their ability to overcome oxidative stress. The viable but non culturable (VBNC) state is a condition in which bacterial cells are viable and metabolically active, but resistant to cultivation using a routine growth medium. We investigated the ability of V. parahaemolyticus to form VBNC cells, and to subsequently become resuscitated. The ability to control VBNC cell formation in the laboratory allowed us to selectively isolate VBNC cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting, and to differentiate subpopulations based on their metabolic activity, cell shape and the ability to cause disease in Galleria mellonella. Our results showed that two subpopulations (P1 and P2) of V. parahaemolyticus VBNC cells exist and can remain dormant in the VBNC state for long periods. VBNC subpopulation P2, had a better fitness for survival under stressful conditions and showed 100% revival under favourable conditions. Proteomic analysis of these subpopulations (at two different time points: 12 days (T12) and 50 days (T50) post VBNC) revealed that the proteome of P2 was more similar to that of the starting microcosm culture (T0) than the proteome of P1. Proteins that were significantly up or down-regulated between the different VBNC populations were identified and differentially regulated proteins were assigned into 23 functional groups, the majority being assigned to metabolism functional categories. A lactate dehydrogenase (lldD) protein, responsible for converting lactate to pyruvate, was significantly upregulated in all subpopulations of VBNC cells. Deletion of the lactate dehydrogenase (RIMD2210633:Delta lldD) gene caused cells to enter the VBNC state significantly more quickly compared to the wild-type, and adding lactate to VBNC cells aided their resuscitation and extended the resuscitation window. Addition of pyruvate to the RIMD2210633:Delta lldD strain restored the wild-type VBNC formation profile. This study suggests that lactate dehydrogenase may play a role in regulating the VBNC state.

VL  - 201
SP  - 192-206
AB  - South Africa has large deposit of coal that supports about 95% of electric power generation in the country. The fuel is fast depleting, though the current reserve may serve for the next century. However, the emissions from the coal projects huge threat to the environment. Similarly, the country has abundant solid wastes that can be co-gasified with coal to H-2 enriched syngas for clean energy production. A 5 MW combined heat and power plant was studied using different coal-to-solid waste ratios of 1:1, 3:2, and 4:1 and economy of the plant was evaluated with feedstock costing (WFC) and without feedstock costing (WOFC). The lower heating value of the fuels, determined from a model equation was applied to estimate the annual feedstock requirement and the feed rate. Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period (PBP) were used to evaluate the viability of the power generation at the 10th, 11th, 17th and 18th year business periods. The predicted optimum period of the plant is the 10th year. The use of Coal + Pine saw-dust (PSD) blend of blend ratio 1:1, is the most attractive feedstock for the energy generation. A higher profit of about 13.82%, and 23.56% were estimated for the use of Coal + PSD as compared to the use of 100% Matla coal at WFC and WOFC, thus; enabling a savings of about 1,868.81 t feedstock per annum. The use of Coal + PSD blend of blend ratio 1:1 reduces the CO, CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions by 3.4%, 23.28%, 22.9%, and 0.55%, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 13

SP  - 301-319
AB  - Overheating in buildings arising from climatic extreme heat events has been identified as a health concern to vulnerable occupants. However, there have been very limited studies to generate suitable weather data to evaluate by simulation the overheating risk and its effect on the comfort and health of occupants. This paper develops a methodology to identify reference summer weather years (RSWY) for overheating risk analysis. The methodology includes generation of historical climate data, and development of a heat stress metric for the definition and characterization of heat events. The Standard Effective Temperature was selected among a short list of popular metrics, modified and named t-SET to account for transient heat events, activity levels of occupants, and thermoregulatory controls of sleeping subjects. The t-SET model predictions compared well with measured body temperatures of subjects undergoing multi-stage activities under hot conditions. The t-SET index was used to generate RSWY for selected Canadian cities.

TI  - A sustainable approach to managing the treatment of mine waters associated with historic mining
SP  - 1303-1309
AB  - The Coal Authority operates over 70 mine water treatment schemes across the UK and treats around 100 billion litres of mine water per annum to protect the water environment. Funded by the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change to manage the legacy of historic coal mining in Britain, the Authority is challenged to build new mine water treatment schemes within a flat line budget. In 2015, the Coal Authority commenced an innovation work stream to accelerate efficiencies and generate income to off-set costs. This programme ambitiously aims to deliver the UK coal mine water treatment programme without government funding and with improved environmental benefits. These aims will be achieved through efficiencies, income generation, adopting transferable technologies, using renewable energy and introducing step-change innovation. To achieve this aim step changes are needed in terms of design and operation of schemes, but also in terms to how the water and by products are considered. Step-change designs include the adoption of small footprint schemes with minimal chemical dosing requirements and below ground schemes. Aeration and degassing technologies are being progressed to accelerate iron deposition rates. By products for reuse include mine water for non-drinking purposes; over 63 MW of low carbon recoverable heat and over 4,000 dry tonnes of ferrous hydroxide ochre produced each year. A Ferrous Hydroxide Product Project is underway aiming to cease disposal to landfill and deliver commercial uses for this material. Options for re-use include phosphate management in rivers, agriculture and wastewater treatment, and conversion into pigments and coagulants. Commercially viability requires innovation throughout the product development process including in desludging, dewatering and processing. Approaching mine water as an asset and understanding the value of benefits delivered by mine water treatment is helping the Coal Authority ensure the long-term sustainability of mine water treatment in the UK.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of alternative optimization strategies for a novel heliostat-driven hydrogen production/injection system coupled with a vanadium chlorine cycle
VL  - 267
AB  - This paper introduces an innovative and cost-effective multi-generation plant, driven by the central receiverbased concentrated solar systems, to facilitate the desired global green-transition process. The vanadium chlorine thermochemical cycle, which uses hydrogen instead of natural gas in the combustion chamber, is used as an innovative approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed system also includes a thermoelectric generator (TEG) for excess power generation and a multi-effect desalination (MED) unit to reduce exergy loss. The suggested system's technological, economic, and environmental metrics are analyzed and compared to a similar system that stores the created hydrogen rather than burning it in the combustion chamber. Furthermore, the viability of the studied model is investigated under the optimal operating condition, using the example of Sevilla in order to make the conclusions more reliable. According to the findings, the suggested novel configuration is a better alternative in terms of cost and environmental impact owing to decreased product energy costs and CO2 emissions. The outcomes further indicate that the substitution of the condenser with TEG leads to considerably higher power production. According to the optimization findings, the multi-objective grey wolf algorithm is the best optimization strategy compared to the non-dominated genetic and particle swarm approaches. At the best optimization point, 2.5% higher exergy efficiency, 1 $/GJ cheaper product energy cost, and 0.12 kg/kWh lower levelized CO2 emission are achieved compared to the operating condition. The Sankey diagram indicates that the solar heliostat system has the highest irreversibility. The exergy analysis results further reveal that the flue gas condensation process through the Rankine cycle and MED unit lead to a 53.2% reduction in exergy loss. Finally, considerable CO2 emission reductions show that the suggested new method is an effective solution for cleaner energy production in warmer climate countries.

TI  - Heat stress increase under climate change twice as large in cities as in rural areas: A study for a densely populated midlatitude maritime region
VL  - 44
IS  - 17
SP  - 8997-9007
AB  - Urban areas are usually warmer than their surrounding natural areas, an effect known as the urban heat island effect. As such, they are particularly vulnerable to global warming and associated increases in extreme temperatures. Yet ensemble climate-model projections are generally performed on a scale that is too coarse to represent the evolution of temperatures in cities. Here, for the first time, we combine unprecedented long-term (35years) urban climate model integrations at the convection-permitting scale (2.8km resolution) with information from an ensemble of general circulation models to assess temperature-based heat stress for Belgium, a densely populated midlatitude maritime region. We discover that the heat stress increase toward the mid-21st century is twice as large in cities compared to their surrounding rural areas. The exacerbation is driven by the urban heat island itself, its concurrence with heat waves, and urban expansion. Cities experience a heat stress multiplication by a factor 1.4 and 15 depending on the scenario. Remarkably, the future heat stress surpasses everywhere the urban hot spots of today. Our results demonstrate the need to combine information from climate models, acting on different scales, for climate change risk assessment in heterogeneous regions. Moreover, these results highlight the necessity for adaptation to increasing heat stress, especially in urban areas.

TI  - Entamoeba histolytica: kinetic and molecular evidence of a previously unidentified pyruvate kinase
VL  - 106
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-21
AB  - We report the kinetic characterization of a previously unidentified pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in extracts from Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. This activity was about 74% of the activity of pyruvate phosphate dikinase. EhPK differed from most PKs in that its pH optimum was 5.5-6.5 and was inhibited by high PEP concentrations (1-5 mM); these are concentrations at which PK is usually assayed. The optimal temperature was above 40degreesC with negligible activity below 20degreesC. EhPK exhibited hyperbolic kinetics with respect to both PEP (K-m = 0.018 mM) and ADP (K-m = 1.05 mM). However, it exhibited a sigmoidal behavior with respect to PEP at sub-saturating ADP concentrations. EhPK did not require monovalent cations for activity. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphate was a potent non-essential activator; it increased the affinity for ADP without modification of the V a or the affinity for PEP. Phosphate, citrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate significantly inhibited EhPK activity. A putative EhPK gene fragment found in EhDNA was analyzed. The data indicate that E. histolytica trophozoites contain an active PK, which might contribute to the generation of glycolytic ATP for parasite survival. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Destinations of third-generation Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths in Jilin and its effects on population genetic diversity
VL  - 57
IS  - 4
SP  - 333-345
AB  - Third-generation oriental armyworm larvae, Mythimna separata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), have caused considerable economic losses in Jilin. Understanding the occurrence, regularity and return movement of third-generation adults is crucial for pest forecasting. The study was conducted using systemic monitoring, radar observations and molecular markers from 2015 to 2019. The main results are as follows: (1) third-generation moths were regularly captured from late August to late September. These moths have been attributed to local emergence and were identified as an "emigration population." Wind speed and temperature were advantageous for moth migration, and advantageous northeasterly winds account for 9.6% of the total. Radar studies determined that the migrant flying height was mainly below 600 m. Moths migrated over a range of directions, including their return movements. Forward trajectories predicted that the destination regions of the Korean Peninsula, the Russian Far East, and northern China were unfavorable for survival. (2) A total of 29 haplotypes were detected. There were unique haplotypes between two sampling years. The haplotype analysis indicated similar content in the two sampling years. The haplotype diversity indices appear to have been maintained. Overall, our findings indicate that the moths did not make a successful return flight, but the genetic diversity was unaffected.

TI  - Climate and vegetation structure determine plant diversity in Quercus ilex woodlands along an aridity and human-use gradient in Northern Algeria
VL  - 208
IS  - 4
SP  - 268-284
AB  - We studied the influence of environmental factors relating to climate, soil and vegetation cover on total species richness, species richness of different life-forms and species composition of plant communities occurring in Quercus ilex woodlands, across a 450-km long transect in Northern Algeria constituting a gradient of aridity and human use. We sampled vegetation and collected environmental data in 81 10 m x 10 m plots in five zones representing the largest Q. ilex woodlands throughout the study area, analysing them within an a priori hypothesis framework with the use of Path Analysis. Changes in plant diversity were mainly influenced by environmental factors related to precipitation and temperature regimes, as well as by total plant cover. In particular, changes in species composition were determined by factors associated with the temperature regime through their influence on both woody and annual herbaceous plant richness, and by factors related to the precipitation regime through their influence on perennial herbaceous plant richness, likely due to the differential tolerances of these functional groups to cold and water stress. Our results emphasize the importance of differences in environmental adaptability of the most important life-forms with regard to explaining compositional change (beta diversity) along aridity gradients, and the mediator role of total plant cover in relation to the effects of soil conditions on plant diversity.

AB  - Bioceramics are widely used materials as filling bone and implants, which can be classified into three groups according to their reactivity with the body fluid and its interaction with the bone tissue: bioinert, resorbable or bioactive. Within the last class mentioned are bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics. One of the most researched topics in this area is based on ensuring the ability of the implant to long term survival, as well as improves its mechanical properties. Hence, glass-ceramics are produced by a controlled crystallization of a glass, which enables to obtain very small crystallite sizes, that increases considerably the mechanical resistance and durability of the material. The SiO2-CaO-P2O5-Na2O system is the most widely used for the production of bioactive glasses, which can be added to other compounds such as Al2O3 that, forming part of some crystal phase in the glass-ceramic, that can provide improved mechanical properties. In this work, two glasses were prepared starting from commercial Bioglass composition, adding potassium and aluminum. Both were included in the formulation by means of purified feldspar. Performed tests were differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction in order to follow up thermal transformation and to reveal the developed phases after such treatments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

VL  - 20

SP  - 1336-1349
AB  - Background. Glucose degradation products (GDPs) are formed during heat sterilization of peritoneal dialysis fluid and, to a lesser extent, during their prolonged storage. In vitro studies have demonstrated that GDPs impair functions of peritoneal mesothelial cells, including proliferation, viability and cytokine release. In the present study, we studied the acute effect of GDPs on the expression of tight junction-associated protein, zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). The role of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced by GDPs in the expression of ZO-1 was also examined. Methods. HPMC were cultured with GDPs, including 2-furaldehyde (FurA), methylglyoxal (M-Glx) and 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE). The expression of ZO-1 and the synthesis of VEGF were examined. To define the role of VEGF on the regulation of ZO-1 expression, HPMC were cultured with GDPs in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody to VEGF. The signal pathways involved in VEGF synthesis induced by GDPs were also characterized. Results. ZO-1 expression in HPMC was downregulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner following culture with subtoxic concentrations of GDPs (FurA, M-Glx and 3,4-DGE). All three GDPs increased VEGF synthesis in HPMC. Exogenous VEGF downregulated the expression of ZO-1 and neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody reversed the effect of GDPs on ZO-1 expression in HPMC, suggesting the action of GDPs on ZO-1 expression was mediated by VEGF. All three GDPs activated the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathways. The GDP-induced VEGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta synthesis in HPMC was partially reduced by either the p42/p44 MAPK inhibitor (PD98059) or the PKC inhibitor (staurosporine). More importantly, the VEGF and TGF-beta synthesis induced by GDPs in HPMC was completely blocked by synergistic action of both inhibitors. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that short-term exposure to GDPs downregulates ZO-1 expression in HPMC through the generation of VEGF. Our study provides evidence that GDPs can directly induce VEGF and TGF-beta production in HPMC through the activation of p42/44 MAPK and PKC signal transduction pathways.

TI  - A heatwave increases turnover and regional dominance in microbenthic metacommunities
VL  - 47
SP  - 1-11
AB  - While the effect of the global biodiversity crisis on local species loss is still debated, there is empirical evidence for major changes in local biodiversity attributed to increased species turnover. In communities exposed to a climate stressor, species turnover can lead to increased dominance of well-adapted species and consequently to an overall decline in species diversity. Despite the known importance of species turnover for community dynamics and functioning, experimental results on the connection between biodiversity loss and species turnover are scarce. We still do not fully understand which specific factors increase the rate of change in species composition, especially when considering natural compared to artificially lab assembled communities. In the present study, we experimentally tested whether a heatwave and dispersal increased species turnover and decreased species diversity in natural benthic diatom communities with different initial species compositions. We found that on the local scale, dispersal had overall positive effects on species richness while the relationship between exposure to the heatwave, species turnover, and diversity depended on initial community composition. However, on the regional (i.e. metacommunity) scale, exposure to the heatwave and dispersal both increased turnover and decreased Shannon diversity by almost 50%. Turnover in these metacommunities was not caused by a loss of species, but rather by a change in dominance patterns leading to homogenization, and consequently decreased diversity. Our study shows that climate change can destabilize community composition and degrade species diversity, but still after ca. 15 generations does not decrease the number of species in the community, demonstrating that the response of species diversity and richness to changing conditions can be fundamentally decoupled on ecological time scales.

TI  - PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FRENCH R&D PROGRAM FOR HIGH AND VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE REACTORS
SP  - 67-+
AB  - A R&D programme has been launched addressing the needs of the development of an indirect cycle flexible modular HTR operating at 850 degrees C for electricity generation and/or heat production for industrial processes. In the frame of this program, several significant technical challenges required to demonstrate the viability and performance of the system have been successfully addressed. Design and safety analysis needed the development of computational tools, therefore reactor physics, and thermo-fluid dynamics codes have been developed and are now in the process of being validated in the frame of international code-to-code and code to experiment benchmarks. Most importantly, the performance of the HTR/VHTR fuel identified as TRISO-coated particle must prove to be excellent in operating as well as accidental conditions. A manufacturing and quality control process has been developed and now fuel qualification based on irradiation and heating safety tests is being prepared on the basis of irradiation programs in France and in the frame of the GENERATION IV International Forum (GIF) as well as the development of fuel behaviour models including performance data, failure particle prediction and long-term integrity of the coating. Material and component technologies have been investigated in normal and accident conditions for V/HTR objectives. Significant progress has been made for vessel structures and reactor core structural elements. Major challenges still lie ahead for plate type compact intermediate heat exchangers, especially at temperatures above 850 degrees C, but an alternative solution with helical tubes is also being developed. In order to demonstrate that materials have adequate performance over long service life under impure helium environment and constraints, the research programme focuses on microstructural and mechanical property data, long-term irradiation behaviour, corrosion, modelling and codification of design rules as well as qualification of components in representative helium test loops. The potential of this type of reactor for higher performances in terms of fuel burn-up and temperature (VHTR objective) has been explored, in particular for application to hydrogen production. The major research axes on hydrogen production technologies include the development and optimization of high temperature electrolysis and thermo-chemical water splitting processes such as sulphur/iodine or hybrid sulphur. Alternative thermo-chemical hydrogen generation processes operating at lower temperatures are also investigated. This paper addresses the R&D work performed since 2001 and the future work anticipated until 2012, where decisions about a demonstrator could be made at a European level within the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technological Platform (SNE-TP). This program is strongly connected to the Euratom Framework Programmes as well as to GIF.

TI  - Assessment of potential suspended sediment yield in Japan in the 21st century with reference to the general circulation model climate change scenarios
VL  - 102
SP  - 1-9
AB  - In recent decades, soil erosion by water has become a worldwide problem, especially with climate change and progressive declines in the ratio of natural resources to human populations. Changes in future climate will influence soil erosion, particularly suspended sediment (SS) yield, and alter the effectiveness of water resources management strategies from a water quality perspective. We qualitatively assessed future changes in SS yield in Japan. We focused on the impacts of future hydrological changes projected by two models, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), whose results have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on SS in Japan depend on the balance between changes in climatic and geologic factors. Methods for assessing impact using the catchment simulator were expanded to estimate the SS yield for the whole of Japan. The results indicated that SS generation will increase by the 2090s, with an 8% increase predicted using MRI-GCM data and a 24% increase using MIROC data, compared to present-day values measured by the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMEDAS) of the Japan Meteorological Agency. Analysis by month showed the largest increases in SS in September, related to the frequency of extreme events such as typhoons. Increased SS can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including reduced crop productivity, worsened water quality, lower effective reservoir water levels, flooding and habitat destruction. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on SS generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Heritability and genetic correlations of heart rate variability at rest and during stress in the Oman Family Study
VL  - 36
IS  - 7
SP  - 1477-1485
AB  - Introduction:Individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV) can be partly attributed to genetic factors that may be more pronounced during stress. Using data from the Oman Family Study (OFS), we aimed to estimate and quantify the relative contribution of genes and environment to the variance of HRV at rest and during stress; calculate the overlap in genetic and environmental influences on HRV at rest and under stress using bivariate analyses of HRV parameters and heart rate (HR).Methods:Time and frequency domain HRV variables and average HR were measured from beat-to-beat HR obtained from electrocardiogram recordings at rest and during two stress tests [mental: Word Conflict Test (WCT) and physical: Cold Pressor Test (CPT)] in the OFS - a multigenerational pedigree consisting of five large Arab families with a total of 1326 participants. SOLAR software was used to perform quantitative genetic modelling.Results:Heritability estimates for HRV and HR ranged from 0.11 to 0.31 for rest, 0.09-0.43 for WCT, and 0.07-0.36 for CPT. A large part of the genetic influences during rest and stress conditions were shared with genetic correlations ranging between 0.52 and 0.86 for rest-WCT and 0.60-0.92 for rest-CPT. Nonetheless, genetic rest-stress correlations for most traits were significantly smaller than 1 indicating some stress-specific genetic effects.Conclusion:Genetic factors significantly influence HRV and HR at rest and under stress. Most of the genetic factors that influence HRV at rest also influence HRV during stress tests, although some unique genetic variance emerges during these challenging conditions.

TI  - Development of gas cooled reactors and experimental setup of high temperature helium loop for in-pile operation
VL  - 276
SP  - 87-97
AB  - Rapidly increasing energy and electricity demands, global concerns over the climate changes and strong dependence on foreign fossil fuel supplies are powerfully influencing greater use of nuclear power. In order to establish the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet tomorrow's needs for clean and reliable energy production the fundamental research and development issues need to be addressed for the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable. One of the six Generation-IV concepts is a very high temperature reactor (VHTR). The VHTR concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using high temperature helium as the coolant. Because helium is naturally inert and single-phase, the helium-cooled reactor can operate at much higher temperatures, leading to higher efficiency. Current VHTR concepts will use fuels such as uranium dioxide, uranium carbide, or uranium oxycarbide. Since some of these fuels are new in nuclear industry and due to their unknown properties and behavior within VHTR conditions it is very important to address these issues by investigate their characteristics within conditions close to those in VHTRs. This research can be performed in a research reactor with in-pile helium loop designed and constructed in Research Center Rez Ltd. One of the topics analyzed in this article are also physical characteristic and benefits of gas coolants. The purpose of the high temperature helium loop (HTHL) is to simulate technical and chemical conditions of VHTR's coolant. The loop is intended to serve an as experimental device for fatigue and creep tests of construction metallic materials for gas-cooled reactors and it should be also employed for research in field of gaseous coolant chemistry. The loop will serve also for tests of nuclear graphite, dosing and helium purification systems. Because the VHTR is a new reactor concept, major technical uncertainties remain relative to helium-cooled advanced reactor systems. This paper summarizes also the concept of the HTHL in the Research Centre Rez Ltd., its design, utilization and future plans for experimental setup. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adaptation of Rabensburg virus (RBGV) to vertebrate hosts by experimental evolution
VL  - 528
SP  - 30-36
AB  - Rabensburg virus (RBGV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) has been classified as both a novel flavivirus and a unique lineage of West Nile virus (WNV). RBGV and WNV share approximately 76% sequence homology, yet RBGV does not replicate to high viral titers within vertebrate cell lines at physiological temperatures and has not been naturally isolated from a vertebrate host. These unique genetic and biological characteristics make RBGV a viable tool to identify the genetic determinants of flavivirus infectivity and fitness in vertebrate hosts. Using experimental evolution, we characterized mutated variants of RBGV that have altered capacity for infection and replication in various cell lines. Shared genetic differences within these variants were identified throughout the genome, with a large majority found in the NS3 and NS5 genes. Our results support a role for the replication complex in host utilization and suggest that epistatic interactions likely contribute to host-specific fitness and emergence.

TI  - Evaluation of the adaptability of the Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) to low and intermediate salinities
SP  - 15-17
AB  - The St. Lawrence coastal area is characterized by strong salinity gradients along its axis. The Atlantic wolffish, a coastal species, is expected to be tolerant to a wide range of salinities and temperatures. Based on the energy allocation theory, it as been hypothesised that energy spent on ionic regulation at high salinities (> 14parts per thousand) is not allocated to somatic growth. In order to evaluate the possibility of rearing this species at intermediate and low salinities and the potential for associated growth benefits, challenge tests followed by growth trials were conducted. Experiments were conducted on 1(+) following direct transfer to 7-14-21-28parts per thousand. Atlantic wolffish displayed a high tolerance to low salinity. Observed growth in length and the calculation of the growth trajectories (length and weight) indicated better growth performance at intermediate salinity (14parts per thousand) compared to full-strength seawater (28parts per thousand). After 19 weeks, fish at 7parts per thousand displayed lower osmolality, but growth and survival were not impaired compared to the group held at 28parts per thousand salinity. This species can be reared successfully at intermediate salinities with growth enhancement perspectives. The typical U-shaped enzyme adaptation curve in relation to salinity was observed for branchial Na(+)K(+)ATPase and LDH, from week 14 after exposure.

TI  - Assessment of geothermal assisted coal-fired power generation using an Australian case study
VL  - 82
SP  - 283-300
AB  - A systematic techno-economic analysis of geothermal assisted power generation (GAPG) was performed for a 500 MW unit of a typical coal-fired power plant located at the upper Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Specifically, the GAPG viability and performance was examined by investigating the impacts of reservoir temperature, resource distance, hybridisation scheme, and economic conditions including carbon tax and Renewable Energy Certificates (REC). The process simulation package, Aspen HYSYS, was employed for all simulation purposes. Thermodynamically, GAPG system was found to increase the power output of the plant by up to 19% under the booster mode whilst in fuel saving mode the coal consumption reduced by up to 0.3 million tonne/year decreasing the Green House Gas (GHG) emission by up to 15% (0.6 million tonne/year). Economic analyses showed that for a typical HDR resource with a reservoir temperature about 150 degrees C located within a 5 km radius from the power plant, the GAPG system becomes economically competitive to the stand-alone fossil fuel based plant when minimum carbon tax and RECs rates of 40 $/tonne and 60 cents/kW h are introduced. The figure of merit analyses comparing GAPG system with both stand-alone fossil fuel and stand-alone geothermal plants showed that an economically feasible GAPG system requires the use of HDR resources located no further than 20 km from the plants. Reference maps were also developed to predict suitable conditions for which the hybrid plant outperforms the stand-alone plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adenosine deaminase-acid phosphatase association and the environment: A study in a continental Italian population
VL  - 12

SP  - 214-220
AB  - Three hundred fifty newborns from Rome and 351 from Penne were studied in continental Italy. Medium high altitude above sea level and cold winters characterize the area of Penne, while low altitude and very mild winters characterize the area of Rome. An effect of environmental conditions on the association between adenosine deaminase (ADA) and acid phosphatase (ACP1), previously shown in Sardinia, has been confirmed in continental Italy. When compared with expected independent assortment, the proportion of ACP1*A/*A carrying the ADA*2 allele is lower than expected in the lowlands and higher than expected in highlands. In continental Italy there is an interaction among ACP1-ADA genotype, season of conception, and locality. The excess of *A/*A newborns carrying the ADA*2 allele is present only among those conceived in the first half of the year (January-June). Among newborns in Penne conceived in the Spring, the proportion of those with *A/*A genotype is increased and these infants show decreased intrauterine growth, The present data suggest that ADA and ACP1 interact during intrauterine life with effects on development and survival and that such effects are dependent on local environment and season of conception.

AB  - Survival of Bemisia tabaci (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) on the winter conditions of the north zone Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this job was to study the influence of the winter temperatures on the survival of B. tabaci adults. The individuals are subjected to a cycle of temperatures which corresponds to temperatures noticed during 24 hours by one of the most cold days of the winter of the south of France (Perpignan). The evolution of these temperatures is reproduced in controlled conditions, and the individuals were subjected to one, three or four of these cycles. After a cycle of 24 hours, the rate of survival of the individuals is 73,5 % while that of the control is 85%. After an exposure of 3 cycles, the rate of survival remained high (44,4 %). The probability to survive to 4 cycles of 24 hours is 7,4 %. The Mediterranean North seems to be a buffer zone for the establishment of the populations of B. tabaci because neither the regularly recorded minimal temperatures nor their length seem to be limiting factors.

TI  - The PqsR and RhlR Transcriptional Regulators Determine the Level of Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal Synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Producing Two Different pqsABCDE mRNA Isoforms
VL  - 196
IS  - 23
SP  - 4163-4171
AB  - Regulation of gene expression plays a key role in bacterial adaptability to changes in the environment. An integral part of this gene regulatory network is achieved via quorum sensing (QS) systems that coordinate bacterial responses under high cellular densities. In the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (pqs) signaling pathway is crucial for bacterial survival under stressful conditions. Biosynthesis of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is dependent on the pqsABCDE operon, which is positively regulated by the LysR family regulator PqsR and repressed by the transcriptional regulator protein RhlR. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that not only PqsR but also RhlR activates transcription of pqsA. The latter uses an alternative transcriptional start site and induces expression of a longer transcript that forms a secondary structure in the 5' untranslated leader region. As a consequence, access of the ribosome to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is restricted and translation efficiency reduced. We propose a model of a novel posttranscriptional regulation mechanism that fine-tunes PQS biosynthesis, thus highlighting the complexity of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Predictability of stratospheric sudden warming: A case study for 1998/99 winter
VL  - 132
IS  - 7
SP  - 1764-1776
AB  - Predictability of a zonal-wavenumber (WN) 1 stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event occurring in December 1998 is examined using the operational 1-month forecast dataset based upon a numerical weather prediction model (NWPM) of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The stratospheric warming in the polar region of this event is predictable by NWPM from 1 month in advance. The amplification of tropospheric planetary waves triggering the onset of the SSW is closely connected with weak vertical westerly shear near the surface around 60degreesN, in association with rather strong synoptic wave activity. Thus, the fair reproduction of the interaction between zonal-mean flows and synoptic waves in the troposphere for promoting the generation of WN 1 planetary waves is found to be essential for the successful prediction of this event. The authors also point out prolonged predictability for the onset of a tropospheric blocking event occurring over Alaska just after the warming peak. The blocking is formed because of the poleward propagation of planetary waves causing the SSW event, which suggests a predictable downward control of the tropospheric circulation by the stratosphere after the SSW.

TI  - Evolutionary genetic approach to determine junction temperature in electronic packages
SP  - 138-143
AB  - Genetic Algorithms are adaptive search algorithms based on the Darwinian principle of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They efficiently exploit data at hand to anticipate new search points with expected improvement performance. The aim of this paper is to show the feasibility of applying genetic algorithms to determine the thermal profile of a basic package. To illustrate this, genetic algorithms were employed to compute the junction temperature of a 12-pin lead DIP chip. Further, the package parameters were modified to check the capabilities of genetic algorithms to determine the junction temperature of the chip. The paper also shows that the solutions obtained from this evolutionary search method, does not depend on the initially generated members of the family of solutions. The present application is specific only for purposes of illustration. This study also elaborates the factors that affect the efficiency of the solutions obtained by genetic algorithms. Finally, the paper shows that the rules of natural selection can be used to solve more complex problems faced in the packaging industry.

TI  - Physiological tolerances account for range limits and abundance structure in an invasive slug
VL  - 276
IS  - 1661
SP  - 1459-1468
AB  - Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying range limits and abundance structure, few studies have sought to do so. Here we use a terrestrial slug species, Deroceras panormitanum, that has invaded a remote, largely predator-free, Southern Ocean island as a model system to do so. Across Marion Island, slug density does not conform to an abundant centre distribution. Rather, abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps. These are associated with this desiccation-sensitive species' preference for biotic and drainage line habitats that share few characteristics except for their high humidity below the vegetation surface. The coastal range margin has a threshold form, rapidly rising from zero to high density. Slugs do not occur where soil-exchangeable Na values are higher than 3000 mg kg(-1), and in laboratory experiments, survival is high below this value but negligible above it. Upper elevation range margins are a function of the inability of this species to survive temperatures below an absolute limit of -6.4 degrees C, which is regularly exceeded at 200 m altitude, above which slug density declines to zero. However, the linear decline in density from the coastal peak is probably also a function of a decline in performance or time available for activity. This is probably associated with an altitudinal decline in mean annual soil temperature. These findings support previous predictions made regarding the form of density change when substrate or climatic factors set range limits.

VL  - 68

SP  - 3183-3189
AB  - An isolate of L. monocytogenes Scott A that is tolerant to high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), named AK01, was isolated upon a single pressurization treatment of 400 MPa for 20 min and was further characterized. The survival of exponential- and stationary-phase cells of AK01 in ACES [N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid] buffer was at least 2 log units higher than that of the wild type over a broad range of pressures (150 to 500 MPa), while both strains showed higher HHP tolerance (piezotolerance) in the stationary than in the exponential phase of growth. In semiskim milk, exponential-phase cells of both strains showed lower reductions upon pressurization than in buffer, but again, AK01 was more piezotolerant than the wild type. The piezotolerance of AK01 was retained for at least 40 generations in rich medium, suggesting a stable phenotype. Interestingly, cells of AK01 lacked flagella, were elongated, and showed slightly lower maximum specific growth rates than the wild type at 8, 22, and 30degreesC. Moreover, the piezotolerant strain AK01 showed increased resistance to heat, acid, and 11,0, compared with the wild type. The difference in HHP tolerance between the piezotolerant strain and the wild-type strain could not be attributed to differences in membrane fluidity, since strain AK01 and the wild type had identical in situ lipid melting curves as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The demonstrated occurrence of a piezotolerant isolate of L. monocytogenes underscores the need to further investigate the mechanisms underlying HHP resistance of food-borne microorganisms, which in turn will contribute to the appropriate design of safe, accurate, and feasible HHP treatments.

Shrimp acclimated at 10 parts per thousand and 19 parts per thousand preferred salinities higher than those to which they were acclimated. However, shrimp acclimated at 28 parts per thousand and 36 parts per thousand preferred lower salinities than those to which they were acclimated. This behavior was associated with the selection of a higher temperature. Behavioral studies of organisms exposed to experimental environmental gradients allowed the establishment of optimal cultivation conditions of L. vannamei. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Greenhouse Design: Concepts and Trends
VL  - 952
SP  - 605-620
AB  - Greenhouses provide fresh vegetables and ornamentals year-round, worldwide; the type and equipment used in any region generally suit the local weather, construction materials availability, and type of crop. In each region, elements such as structure, cover materials, climate-control systems, and irrigation and fertilization equipment are routinely evaluated by growers, designers and researchers, to improve their efficiency, reduce inputs, and minimize undesired environmental effects. The term "greenhouse design" includes too many aspects to be covered in one paper, therefore, this paper mainly addresses developments related to possible effects of manipulations of structure and cover materials on microclimate; it also emphasizes the main concepts and trends in greenhouse horticulture that emerged during the last decade. The major driving forces toward improving greenhouse design have sprung from the desire to achieve a sustainable greenhouse that is energy neutral, consumes only the essential amount of water, and has minimal negative environmental impact - all while maximizing net financial return. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the development and expansion of tall and large structures, innovative cover materials, and closed and semiclosed greenhouses, and progress in solar greenhouses that harvest solar energy for heating. Most recently the incorporation of arrays of photovoltaic cells for power generation in protected cultivation became popular: a trend that still has to be carefully evaluated. In warm climates we have witnessed the expansion of screenhouses and innovative insect-proof screens that provide a reasonable environment for various crops, with much lower capital investment than fully equipped greenhouses. Progress was also made in development of tools for better and faster design of structures for protected cultivation. For example, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations were extensively used to investigate the effects of structure shape, and ventilator size and arrangement (with or without insect-proof screens) on microclimate. These studies indicated that there is still scope for improving the currently prevailing designs of structures and their components.

VL  - 75

SP  - 3056-3070
AB  - A geographic mosaic of coevolution has produced local reciprocal adaptation in tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima (L.), and the goldenrod ball-gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Fitch 1855). The fly is selected to induce gall diameters that minimize mortality from natural enemies, and the plant is selected to limit gall growth that reduces plant fitness. We conducted a double reciprocal transplant experiment where S. altissima and E. solidaginis from three sites were grown in gardens at each site to partition the gall morphology variation into fly genotype, plant genotype, and the environment components. The host plant gall diameter induced by each E. solidaginis population was adapted to inhibit local natural enemies from ovipositing on or consuming enclosed larvae. Reciprocally, increasing the gall size induced by the local fly population increased the resistance of the local plant host population to gall growth. Differences among sites in natural enemies produced a mosaic of hotspots of coevolutionary arms races between flies selecting for greater gall diameter and plants for smaller diameters, and coldspots where there is no selection on plant or fly for a change in gall diameter. In contrast, the geographic variations of gall length and gall shape were not due to coevolutionary interactions.

TI  - Precambrian ultra-hot orogenic factory: Making and reworking of continental crust
VL  - 746
SP  - 572-586
AB  - Mechanisms of Precambrian orogeny and their contribution to the origin of ultrahigh temperature granulites, granite-greenstone terranes and net crustal growth remain debatable. Here, we use 2D numerical models with 150 degrees C higher mantle temperatures compared to present day conditions to investigate physical and petrological controls of Precambrian orogeny during forced continental plates convergence. Numerical experiments show that convergence between two relatively thin blocks of continental lithosphere with fertile mantle creates a short-lived cold collisional belt that later becomes absorbed by a long-lived thick and flat ultra-hot accretionary orogen with Moho temperatures of 700-1100 degrees C. The orogen underlain by hot partially molten depleted asthenospheric mantle spreads with plate tectonic rates towards the incoming lithospheric block. The accretionary orogeny is driven by delamination of incoming lithospheric mantle with attached mafic lower crust and invasion of the hot partially molten asthenospheric wedge under the accreted crust. A very fast convective cell forms atop the subducting slab, in which hot asthenospheric mantle rises against the motion of the slab and transports heat towards the moving orogenic front. Juvenile crustal growth during the orogeny is accompanied by net crustal loss due to the lower crust subduction. Stability of an ultra-hot orogeny is critically dependent on the presence of relatively thin and warm continental lithosphere with thin crust and dense fertile mantle roots subjected to plate convergence. Increased thickness of the continental crust and subcontinental lithospheric mantle, pronounced buoyancy of the lithospheric roots, and decreased mantle and continental Moho temperature favor colder and more collision-like orogenic styles with thick crust, reduced magmatic activity, lowered metamorphic temperatures, and decreased degree of crustal modification. Our numerical modeling results thus indicate that different types of orogens (cold, mixed-hot and ultra-hot) could be created at the same time in the Early Earth, depending on compositional and thermal structures of interacting continental blocks.

TI  - A spatial analysis of woodfuel based on WISDOM GIS methodology: Multiscale approach in Northern Spain
VL  - 144
SP  - 193-203
AB  - Given the complexity of generating energy from biomass, the need has arisen for support tools to assist in balancing energy and forestry policies which are sufficiently flexible to address the issues of planning and management at small and large scales. The present study aims to adapt WISDOM GIS methodology for application in the autonomous region of Asturias (Northern Spain) and thereby, by creating a geodatabase, to contribute to a support tool for investigating the potential of woodfuel. This will aid the public administration by providing information on woodfuel supply and demand at the regional, municipality and site-specific level, and thus assist in decision making in terms of formulating new energy strategies. In terms of supply (t year(-1)), in this work, woodfuel from forest area is defined as the crown fraction only (branches and leaves), although in the case of Eucalyptus spp., bark is also included as it is remains on-site following extraction of eucalypts for the pulp industry. Non-Forest Direct Supply was calculated on the basis of the relevant categories from an agricultural land use inventory and average woodfuel productivity. In addition, physical and legal constraints related to accessibility of the woodfuel were considered, the former applying restriction filters with values weighted depending on the interaction between slope map, road networks and centres of population, and the latter considering legal limitations in protected areas. In addition, unused waste from the wood processing industry was included. To calculate total woodfuel demand (t year-1) for energy generation (heat and electricity), both the residential and industrial sector were taken into account. All data was georeferenced through Geographic Information Systems (GISs), which allow operations between raster maps to be performed to generate numeric and spatial results focusing on logistics and biomass strategies, depending on the inputs data and scale employed for each scenario considered. In addition, the application of the methodology at the site-specific level illustrates the practical implementation at the small scale of the geodatabase created, by evaluating the woodfuel available to feed, in case 1, a wood-fired power plant in a specific proposed location and, in case 2, this plant combined with a second plant in a different municipality, both cases also taking into consideration industrial demand.

TI  - Evolution of phenotypic plasticity and environmental tolerance of a labile quantitative character in a fluctuating environment
VL  - 27
IS  - 5
SP  - 866-875
AB  - Quantitative genetic models of evolution of phenotypic plasticity are used to derive environmental tolerance curves for a population in a changing environment, providing a theoretical foundation for integrating physiological and community ecology with evolutionary genetics of plasticity and norms of reaction. Plasticity is modelled for a labile quantitative character undergoing continuous reversible development and selection in a fluctuating environment. If there is no cost of plasticity, a labile character evolves expected plasticity equalling the slope of the optimal phenotype as a function of the environment. This contrasts with previous theory for plasticity influenced by the environment at a critical stage of early development determining a constant adult phenotype on which selection acts, for which the expected plasticity is reduced by the environmental predictability over the discrete time lag between development and selection. With a cost of plasticity in a labile character, the expected plasticity depends on the cost and on the environmental variance and predictability averaged over the continuous developmental time lag. Environmental tolerance curves derived from this model confirm traditional assumptions in physiological ecology and provide new insights. Tolerance curve width increases with larger environmental variance, but can only evolve within a limited range. The strength of the trade-off between tolerance curve height and width depends on the cost of plasticity. Asymmetric tolerance curves caused by male sterility at high temperature are illustrated. A simple condition is given for a large transient increase in plasticity and tolerance curve width following a sudden change in average environment.

VL  - 24

SP  - 7-17
AB  - Climatic variability threatens inland ecosystems, fisheries, societies and economies globally. The impacts are evident in India as manifested by altered geographic distribution, loss of species, change in breeding period, life cycle and physiological behaviour of inland fishes. In India, several inland fisheries research advancements have been made including development of innovative environmental, climatological and biological thresholds associated with successful spawning of fish species in the Ganges River basin, which is a landmark in predicting reproductive adaptation and minimum fitness required for natural breeding. The innovative concept of determining a threshold condition factor of the female fish population to indicate readiness for spawning, expressed as pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn 50), has been used to map and benchmark several freshwater fish species and thereby identify potential climate resilient species. A flow chart showing the impact of climatic variability in inland fisheries and climate resilient fisheries have been conceptualized. Moreover, research pertaining to climate change and its impact on aquatic ecology and fisheries, heat wave studies, climate resilient adaptation techniques, carbon sequestration potential of wetlands, and vulnerability assessment framework at various levels has also been reported. In the present compilation we synthesize, report, and discuss the status of scientific advancements on the impact of the climate change, and associated impacts on inland ecosystems and fisheries at various levels, which would help in developing mitigation and adaptation strategies.

TI  - Laboratory bioassay and dose variation of diatomaceous earth surface treatments
SP  - 671-674
AB  - Diatomaceous earth (DE) can be used as a grain protectant under UK conditions as part of an integrated strategy based on cooling and drying. Previous work has shown that a surface treatment of DE applied at 1-3 g/kg prevents development of surface arthropods for a storage season, if the bulk is cooled to 5 degrees C by December. For these experiments, samples were scooped from the surface of treated and untreated bulks of wheat and used to set up efficacy tests under controlled laboratory conditions. Bioassays were carried out at temperatures of 10, 15 and 25 degrees C and moisture contents of 16-17% using two mite and,two insect species. Mean percentage population inhibition was calculated for surface doses of 3, 2 and 1 g/kg after one generation. All doses achieved 100% inhibition against the mites, Acarus siro and Lepidoglyphus destructor, with the exception of 1 g/kg at 25 and 15 degrees C for A. siro and 2 g/kg at 25 degrees C for L. destructor (99.9%). For the insects, 100% inhibition was achieved for Oryzaephilus surinamensis, but developing stages of Sitophilus granarius within the kernel escaped treatment, resulting in inhibitions of 61-99%, depending on dose and temperature. However, this reduction in population compared to the controls showed that the treatment clearly affected the number of eggs laid. Samples from the 2 g/kg treatment were also used to estimate the evenness of surface treatment. The dose achieved across the surface was between 0.55 and 3.46 g/kg. Although uneven, there was no indication that this affected efficacy between paired treatments. These results also suggest that DE treatments will still give protection during different stages of cooling and against surface populations that may occur during summer warming and prolonged storage.

TI  - Environmental efficiency evaluation of thermal power generation in China based on a slack-based endogenous directional distance function model
VL  - 161
SP  - 325-336
AB  - This study proposes a slack-based endogenous directional distance function model (SBEDDF) to assess the environmental impact of China's power generation industry. By selecting directional vectors according to slack values and endowing them with norms, this model guarantees that unit invariance and efficiency value measures are suitable for economic interpretation. The results of this study indicate that the environmental efficiency of China's power generation industry is low and varies considerably from one region to another. The optimal approach to reduction of emissions is unique for each region. For example, in Guangxi, reducing SO2 emissions is the priority, while in Shanxi, NOx emissions need to be targeted. The results of the Tobit regression analysis indicate that the power function of unit elasticity fits the environmental Kuznets curve of the power industry well. These results demonstrate that it is prudent for environmental administrators to tailor emission reduction standards and incentive policies to the prevailing circumstances in a region.

AB  - In a denitration conversion processes of the nuclear fuel cycle, mixed oxides (MOX) are produced from the reprocessing solution (plutonium and uranium mixed nitrate solution) of used nuclear fuel. The microwave heating (MIT) method has various advantages as one of denitration conversion techniques, i.e., this can complete rapidly processes, reduce the waste liquid, and operated easily by the waveguide. Fine crystal powders are thereby generated, and the manufacture of high-density and high-quality pellets is significant advantage. The MH method is accompanied with transient boiling phenomena such as overflow and flushing. From the viewpoint of enhancing mass productivity and cost efficiency, in the future, scaling up for the size of denitration vessel and shortening processing time are desired. In addition, the safe design of device and the appropriate conditions in microwave irradiation process are required. Hence the extensive understanding of transient boiling phenomena induced by microwave heating is important, and the detailed mechanism of flushing and overflow should be clarified. The aim of this study is to clarify transient boiling phenomena and detailed mechanism of flushing and overflow. Flushing and overflow are affected by physical factors such as solution properties, vessel characteristics, and input energy. Distilled water and different dielectric constant solution as working fluid are used. Dielectric constant was adjusted the concentration of potassium chloride aqueous solution. A cylindrical vessel kept enough clean by ultrasonic washing machine before experiments was used. The influence of vessel diameter and initial water depth on flushing and overflow are examined. As input energy, amount of power supplied and position of the object to be heated in a oven are varied. A high-speed video camera was installed to observe boiling phenomena, and thermography and fiber optic thermometer were to measure the temperature on vessel walls and in a solution, respectively. As a result, it was confirmed that generation of single bubble led to flushing from visualization. Boiling water was strongly blown up after rapid generation and collapse of the bubble. Positions where bubbles generated were randomly, and flushing strength is also various. Behaviors leading to flushing were classified into three types. First type is that first generation bubble from heating leads to flushing. Second type is that nucleate boiling continues during heating and stop, finally single bubble generates and leads to flushing. Third type is defined that gradual evaporation occurs without bubbles. Temperature rising behavior of three types were measured. By observing transient boiling phenomena, it was confirmed that numerous microbubbles were instantaneously generated and grown rapidly in water. Thus, we focused the total quantities of heat required for bubble formation and growth and released by flushing were calculated. Finally, both quantity of heat tended to be roughly same.

TI  - Multi-criteria location identification for wind/solar based hydrogen generation: The case of capital cities of a developing country
VL  - 45
IS  - 58
SP  - 33151-33168
AB  - The identification of site location is one of the critical tasks in developing or expanding any supply chain system including the construction of renewable power generation plants. The accurate identification of a plant site can considerably reduce unforeseen risks and costs and also raise productivity and efficacy. As such, this study sought to thoroughly evaluate all capital cities of a developing country for the establishment of a hybrid wind/solar power plant to produce hydrogen while considering the most influential and conflicting criteria. For this, 14 criteria including daily solar radiation, wind power density, clearness index, altitude, population, average sunny hours in a year, unemployment rate, average air temperature, average air humidity, average yearly precipitation, natural disasters, the distance between the site and the main road, average dusty days per year, and land price constituted the set of vital factors. To prioritize alternatives, a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach named FVIKOR (Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) was used. The results indicated that among 31 capital cities, the city of Yazd with a wind power density of 309.5 W/m(2) and daily solar radiation of 5.4 kWh/m(2) would be the best location for the purpose of this study. To validate the findings, FTOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized and it also ranked Yazd as the first option. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to discern the behavior of each criterion and their impact on the ranking of the cities. Finally, for hydrogen generation, an autonomous hybrid wind/solar system was techno-economically assessed using HOMER software. According to the analysis outcome, the proposed system showed a payback period of 7 years with levelized cost of 4.75 $/kg for hydrogen. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Regulating acidogenesis and methanogenesis for the separated bio-generation of hydrogen and methane from saline-to-hypersaline industrial wastewater
VL  - 250
AB  - Given the limitations of acidogens and methanogens activities under saline environments, this work aims to optimize the main operational parameters affecting hydrogen and methane production from saline-to-hypersaline wastewater containing mono-ethylene glycol (MEG). MEG is the main contaminant in several saline industrial effluents. Anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), as a multi-stage system, was used at different temperatures (Le., 19-31 degrees C [ambient] and 35 degrees C), organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0.6-2.2 gCOD/L/d, and salinity of 5-35 gNaCl/L. Mesophilic conditions of 35 degrees C substantially promoted MEG biodegradability (92-98%) and hydrogen/methane productivity, even at elevated salinity. Hydrogen yield (HY) and methane yield (MY) peaked to 258 and 140 mL/gCOD(add), respectively, at OLR 0.64 gCOD/L/d and salinity up to 20-25 gNaCl/L. An immobilized sludge ABR (ISABR), packed with polyurethane media, was further compared with classical ABR, resulting in 1.8-fold higher MY, at 35 gNaCl/L. Microbial analysis showed that introducing attached growth system (ISABR) substantially promoted methanogens abundance, which was dominated by genus Methanosarcina. Among bacterial genera, Acetobacteriwn was dominant, particularly in 1st compartment, representing MEG-degrading/salt-tolerant genus. At high salinity up to 35 gNaCl/L, the multi-phase and attached growth configuration can efficiently reduce the induced salt stress, particularly on methanogens, towards balanced and separated acidogenesis/ methanogenesis. Overall, producing hydrogen and methane from anaerobic treatment of MEG-based saline wastewater is feasible at optimized parameters and configuration.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the Heat-Shock Protein Gene Superfamily in Bemisia tabaci and Expression Pattern Analysis under Heat Shock
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
AB  - Simple Summary Bemisia tabaci MED is an invasive pest that had caused considerable economic damage in the past decades. Its successful colonization is closely related to heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are related to heat resistance. In this study, 33 BtaHsps were identified based on the sequenced genome of B. tabaci MED belonging to six HSP families, among which 22 BtaHsps were newly identified. Analysis of the secondary structure and evolutionary relationship showed that they were all closely related. In addition, BtaHsp90A3 of the HSP90 family was screened by analyzing the expression level changes of these genes under 42 degrees C heat shock and RNAi was performed on the BtaHsp90A3. The results showed that the silencing of BtaHsp90A3 is closely related to the heat resistance of B. tabaci MED. Taken together, this study conducted an in-depth identification of BtaHsps that clarifies their evolutionary relationships and their response to thermal stress in B. tabaci MED. The thermal tolerance of Bemisia tabaci MED, an invasive whitefly species with worldwide distribution, plays an important role in its ecological adaptation during the invasion process. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are closely related to heat resistance. In this study, 33 Hsps (BtaHsps) were identified based on sequenced genome of B. tabaci MED belonging to six HSP families, among which 22 Hsps were newly identified. The secondary structures of a further 22 BtaHsps were also predicted. The results of RT-qPCR showed that heat shock could affect the expression of 14 of the 22 Hsps newly identified in this study. Among them, the expression level of six Hsps increased under 42 degrees C treatment. As the unstudied gene, BtaHsp90A3 had the highest increase rate. Therefore, BtaHsp90A3 was chosen for the RNAi test, and silencing BtaHsp90A3 by RNAi decreased the survival rate of adult B. tabaci at 42 degrees C. The results indicated that only a few Hsps were involved in the thermal tolerance of host whitefly although many Hsps would response under heat stress. This study conducted a more in-depth and comprehensive identification that demonstrates the evolutionary relationship of BtaHsps and illustrates the response of BtaHsps under the influence of thermal stress in B. tabaci MED.

TI  - Ceramide and reactive oxygen species generated by H2O2 induce caspase-3-independent degradation of Akt/protein kinase B
VL  - 277
IS  - 45
SP  - 42943-42952
AB  - This study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms leading to down-regulation of the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) survival pathway during H2O2-induced cell death. H2O2 produced early activation of Akt/PKB and also DNA damage that was followed by stabilization of p53 levels, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generation of ceramide through activation of a glutathione-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase. These events correlated with long term dephosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Akt. A membrane-targeted active Akt version attenuated apoptosis but not necrosis induced by H2O2 and was more resistant to dephosphorylation and proteolysis induced by apoptotic concentrations of H2O2. Proteolysis of Akt was prevented by exogenous addition of glutathione, indicating a role of ROS and ceramide in Akt degradation. However, Akt was degraded similarly in cells transfected with wild type and dominant negative p53 mutant, indicating that degradation of Akt under oxidative injury may be p53-independent. Specific inhibitors of caspase groups I and III prevented proteolysis of Akt/PKB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in cells submitted to apoptotic but not necrotic H2O2 concentrations. Surprisingly, in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells Akt was more sensitive to H2O2-induced degradation than the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, the Akt/PKB double mutant Akt(D108A,D119A), which is not cleaved by caspase-3, and a triple mutant (D453A,D455A,D456A), which lacks the consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage, were also degraded in H2O2-treated cells. Our results suggest that strong oxidants generate intracellular ROS and ceramide which in term lead to down-regulation of Akt by dephosphorylation and caspase-3-independent proteolysis.

TI  - Comparison of food consumption, growth, and metabolism among muskellunge: An investigation of population differentiation
VL  - 125
IS  - 3
SP  - 402-410
AB  - We conducted laboratory evaluations of food consumption, growth, and metabolic rate as functions of water temperature (5-27.5 degrees C) to examine how the young of year in six populations of muskellunge Esox masquinongy (Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, St. Lawrence River, and Wisconsin) from three drainages might perform under various thermal regimes. Relative food consumption (g . g(-1). d(-1)) and growth (g . g(-1). d(-1)) were similar among populations at lower temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C), but at higher temperatures (15-27.5 degrees C) fish from Wisconsin and Ohio had higher consumption and faster growth rates than fish from Kentucky and the St. Lawrence River. Metabolic rates increased with temperature from 0.08 mg O-2 . g(-1). h(-1) at 5 degrees C to 0.25 mg O-2 . g(-1). h(-1) at 25 degrees C, but few differences in metabolic rates were observed among populations at any temperature. Although we found bioenergetic differences among muskellunge from these populations, they could not be explained solely in terms of thermal adaptation or previously defined genetic groupings. Energetic differences among age-0 muskellunge have important implications for conserving existing esocid populations and managing introduced populations.

TI  - Effects of thermal cycles on the microstructure evolution of Inconel 718 during selective laser melting process
VL  - 18
SP  - 1-14
AB  - A staircase Inconel 718 block was fabricated to investigate the effects of the thermal cycles on the microstructure evolution in the selective laser melting (SLM) part using optical scope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The laser beam scanning strategy was clearly shown in the part under OM, including laser scanning pattern and hatch spacing. The Y-plane (side surface) was characterized by elongated colonies of cellular dendrites with an average cell spacing of 0.511 similar to 0.845 mu m. In addition, Laves phase was observed in the inter layers and inter-cellular regions. Under the continuing effects of the thermal cycles, the fraction of the Laves-phase showed a significant drop with their morphology changing from coarse and interconnected particles to discrete Laves phase. This is attributed to the reheating process as Laves phase can be dissolved at a proper heat treatment. In terms of the width of the cellular dendrites, the longer the thermal cycle period is, the coarser the elongated grains are. Due to the preferred orientation of the crystal, the Y-plane and Z-plane had a strong texture of < 1 0 1 > and < 0 0 1 >, respectively. With the repeating thermal cycle period elongating, the maximum intensity of the texture, together with the fraction of larger grains and the high misorientation angles, increased. At the same height, there was no significant changes with the grains size, but the fraction of the high misorientation angles (>15 degrees) increased with the subsequent building of the part. Moreover, the area fraction of the porosity was below 0.2%, with no remarkable effects found from the thermal cycles and the build height.

TI  - Winter wheat yields in the UK: uncertainties in climate and management impacts
VL  - 54
IS  - 1
SP  - 49-68
AB  - Winter wheat is an important UK cereal, suited to the current climate. However, recent climate projections show changes in temperature and precipitation are likely, potentially affecting UK crop yields. Assessments of future yields contain several sources of uncertainty including those associated with climate and potential adaptation. Here we address these uncertainties using the CERES-Wheat model fed with an ensemble of regional model projections and different sowing dates and fertiliser regimes. In all of the 13 administrative regions in the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09), increases in temperature accelerated the development rate of wheat, a result that was robust across the ensemble. This generally leads to positive impacts on yield and a northward shift in cultivation, with some decreases in the south. Uncertainties in yield became greater towards 2100, a result of corresponding increases in the uncertainty of climate changes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that CO2 fertilisation could compensate for yield losses due to changes in temperature and precipitation in most regions. Earlier sowings appear to be more beneficial in the future over the UK, whilst later sowings increase the risk of yield losses. In a warmer climate, increasing the amount of fertiliser did not improve yields and in fact increased the risk to productivity. Critically, adjustments to sowing date and fertiliser addition did not mitigate the loss of yield experienced in southern regions, suggesting limited adaptation potential in this case. We propose that regional yield changes may not be critical for wheat production in the UK as a whole, as losses in some regions are more than compensated for by gains in others.

TI  - Catalytic tri- and tetramerization of ethylene: a mechanistic overview
AB  - On purpose, selective oligomerization of ethylene to its linear trimer and tetramer such as 1-hexene and 1-octene has assumed significant commercial interest. Catalytic systems based on chromium and titanium have shown remarkable selectivity and productivity for the tri and tetramerization of ethylene to 1-hexene or 1-octene. Chromium-based catalysts are the most selective and active and show the highest structural diversity. This article discusses the most recent mechanistic approaches regarding active catalytic species that determine the selectivity to either hexene-1 or octene-1 and reaction parameters that control selectivity of byproducts. Isotopic labeling protocols, in-situ spectroscopic investigations and DFT studies on selected chromium-based catalyst systems are reviewed.

TI  - Habitat Elevation Shapes Microbial Community Composition and Alter the Metabolic Functions in Wild Sable (Martes zibellina) Guts
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
AB  - Simple Summary Environmental changes of habitat shaped the sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) gut microbial community structure and altered the functions of gut microbiota, showing that the wild sable gut microbial community diversity was resilient and responded to environment change. Elevated habitat is a pivotal factor for wild sable survival and reproduction, and the adaptability is in part enabled through their gut microbial communities. Our observations show that despite having been forced to migrate from low altitudes to high altitudes because of anthropogenic habitat encroachment, wild sables showed robustness in adapting to harsh conditions. Additionally, we propose that the crucial factor enabling wild sables to survive in changeable environments was their gut microbial communities. It is widely understood that harsh conditions, such as high altitude and low temperature environments, have an adverse effect on wild fauna survival. However, our results suggested that increasing altitude can enhance some functions in wild sable gut microbial communities. In recent decades, wild sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) habitats, which are often natural forests, have been squeezed by anthropogenic disturbances such as clear-cutting, tilling and grazing. Sables tend to live in sloped areas with relatively harsh conditions. Here, we determine effects of environmental factors on wild sable gut microbial communities between high and low altitude habitats using Illumina Miseq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Our results showed that despite wild sable gut microbial community diversity being resilient to many environmental factors, community composition was sensitive to altitude. Wild sable gut microbial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (relative abundance 38.23%), followed by Actinobacteria (30.29%), and Proteobacteria (28.15%). Altitude was negatively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes, suggesting sable likely consume more vegetarian food in lower habitats where plant diversity, temperature and vegetation coverage were greater. In addition, our functional genes prediction and qPCR results demonstrated that energy/fat processing microorganisms and functional genes are enriched with increasing altitude, which likely enhanced metabolic functions and supported wild sables to survive in elevated habitats. Overall, our results improve the knowledge of the ecological impact of habitat change, providing insights into wild animal protection at the mountain area with hash climate conditions.

TI  - Introgression of Trifolium ambiguum Into Allotetraploid White Clover (Trifolium repens) Using the Ancestral Parent Trifolium occidentale as a Bridging Species
VL  - 13
AB  - White clover (Trifolium repens) is an allotetraploid pasture legume widely used in moist temperate climates, but its vulnerability to drought, grazing pressure and pests has restricted its wider use. A related species, Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum), is a potential source of resistances to drought, cold, grazing pressure and pests that could potentially be transferred to white clover by interspecific hybridization. Although direct hybridization has been achieved with difficulty, the hybrids have not been easy to backcross for introgression breeding and no interspecific chromosome recombination has been demonstrated. The present work shows that interspecific recombination can be achieved by using Trifolium occidentale, one of the ancestral parents of T. repens, as a bridging species and that large white clover breeding populations carrying recombinant chromosomes can be generated. A 4x hybrid between T. ambiguum and T. occidentale was crossed with T. repens and then backcrossed for two generations. Five backcross hybrid plants with phenotypes appearing to combine traits from the parent species were selected for FISH-GISH analyses. Recombinant chromosome segments from T. ambiguum were found in all five plants, suggesting that recombination frequencies were significant and sufficient for introgression breeding. Despite early chromosome imbalances, the backcross populations were fertile and produced large numbers of seeds. These hybrids represent a major new resource for the breeding of novel resilient forms of white clover.

TI  - The mantle of Scotland viewed through the Glen Gollaidh aillikite
VL  - 112
SP  - 115-132
AB  - The Glen Gollaidh aillikite dyke (58.36741 degrees N 4.69751 degrees W), N.W. Scotland, occurs within the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Moine Supergroup 4km east of the Moine Thrust. Phlogopite Ar-40/Ar-36 measurements give a late Devonian maximum emplacement age of 360.3 +/- 4.9 (2 sigma) Ma. This age occurs in a quiet period of Scottish magmatic history c. 30Ma after the closure of the Iapetus and before the start of intra-plate alkali magmatism which affected southern Scotland for 60 My from c. 350Ma. Abundant chromites and Cr-diopsides and a few unaltered olivines, reflecting a mantle provenance, were recovered from heavy mineral concentrates. The North Atlantic Craton, exposed in Lewisian gneisses west of the Moine thrust, is therefore inferred to extend east at depth under Glen Gollaidh, presenting an opportunity to investigate the thickness and composition of the cratonic margin in the Devonian. The aillikite was found to be barren of diamond and no picro-ilmenites or garnets were definitively identified. However, mineral chemistry suggests that a proportion of Glen Gollaidh xenocrysts crystallised in equilibrium with garnet. Most spinels are Mg, Al chromites, with some Mg chromite present. All fall within the garnet peridotite field based on Ti and Cr but with insufficient Cr2O3 (up to 47.2wt%) to be consistent with the diamond stability field. Amongst Cr-diopsides 30% of grains have Cr and Al contents consistent with derivation from garnet peridotite. The majority of clinopyroxenes also show a marked depletion in heavy compared to light rare-earth elements, again consistent with equilibration with garnet. The opx-cpx solvus thermometer demonstrates that average Cr-diopside compositions require at least 37kbar to give a temperature (979 degrees C) lying even on a relatively warm 40 mWm(-2) geotherm (Hasterok and Chapman Earth Planet Sc Lett 307:59-70, 2011). Large variations in the chemistry of mantle minerals reflect a complex history of metasomatism akin to constituents of alkali igneous rocks elsewhere in the Hebridean and Northern Highlands Terranes. Fertilised mantle provided the conditions for generation of aillikite melts, probably triggered by break-off of the advancing Avalonia slab. The cratonic root underlying the Glen Gollaidh aillikite during the late Devonian was apparently too thin to lie within the diamond stability field, consistent with xenoliths from alkali basalts further south. Nonetheless, sufficient geophysical and mineral chemical evidence supports Glen Gollaidh aillikite sitting close to the edge of diamond-prospective mantle therefore suggesting diamond potential a short distance to the west within the Lewisian and what is now East Greenland.

TI  - A case study of avoiding the heat-related mortality impacts of climate change under mitigation scenarios
VL  - 6
SP  - 104-111
AB  - We compare heat-related mortality impacts for three European cities, London, Lisbon and Budapest, under five climate change policies representing different dates at which carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions peak, rates at which emissions decline, and emissions floors, and compare them with a non-mitigation business-as-usual emissions scenario, for three time periods, the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. Under an SRES A1B business-as-usual emissions scenario and using climate projections from 21 GCMs, heat-related mortality rates (per 100,000 of the population) attributable to climate change in the 2080s are simulated to be in the range 2-6 for London, 4-50 for Lisbon and 10-24 for Budapest. Whilst the policy scenarios serve to reduce the number of heat-related deaths attributable to climate change, by up to 70% of the A1B impacts under an aggressive mitigation scenario that gives a 50% chance of avoiding a 2 degrees C global-mean temperature rise from pre-industrial times, they do not eradicate the effects of climate change on heat-related mortality. The magnitude of avoided impacts is minor in the early 21st century but increases towards the end of the century. Importantly, the magnitude of avoided impacts is more sensitive to the year at which emissions are reduced than to the rate at which emissions are reduced. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Quantifying the paleogeographic driver of Cretaceous carbonate platform development using paleoecological niche modeling
VL  - 514
SP  - 222-232
AB  - Platform carbonates are a major component of the Earth System but their spatial extent through geological time is difficult to reconstruct, due to the incompleteness of the geological record, sampling heterogeneity and their intrinsic complexity. Here we use coupled ecological niche modeling and deep-time general circulation models to predict the occurrence of platform carbonates at the global scale during the Cretaceous. Specifically, niche modeling uses fuzzy logic to predict probable occurrence of platform carbonates as a function of sea-surface temperature, sea-surface salinity, primary productivity and water depth. The first three parameters derive from Cretaceous global paleoclimatic simulations using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, while bathymetry is based on paleogeographical reconstructions. Model predictions are validated with the well documented and abundant geological data from the Aptian. The methodologies developed for the Aptian are subsequently extended to other Cretaceous time intervals. The results of the niche model accurately predict the geographic distribution of Aptian carbonate platforms if a preference for low open-marine productivity levels is assumed for the rudist-dominated carbonate factories. However, if a preference for high productivity levels is assumed, the modeling results do not match the reported global distribution of Aptian carbonate platforms. From the Early Cretaceous into the Late Cretaceous sea level rose and the continents, on average, moved into lower latitudes. The model predicts a corresponding increase in the extent of the carbonate platforms, mainly due to the increasing extent of shallow-water environments available to carbonate development. These results indicate that long-term sea-level rise may have been a major factor responsible for the increase in the area of platform carbonates during the Cretaceous.

AB  - Larvae of the weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus L. can cause substantial damage to sugarcane and citrus. To test the feasibility of managing Diaprepes populations by flooding canefields for extended periods of time,larval mortalities were recorded after submerging larvae under water in soil filled trays at temperatures from 18 to 27 degrees C for up to 5 weeks. Mean mortality exceeded 90% by 3 weeks of submergence at 24 and 27 degrees C and after 5 weeks at 21 degrees C, but was only 46% after 5 weeks at 18 degrees C. A model was derived by multiple regression analysis, describing the response of mortality to time and temperature. The model accounted for 84% of the variation in larval mortality. Levels of O-2 and pH were monitored in selected trays during the experiment; only pH correlated significantly with larval mortality but contributed only 20% of total variation.

TI  - 3D investigation into the thermal behavior of the wet multi-disk axle brake of an off-highway machinery
VL  - 136
SP  - 576-588
AB  - Accurate prediction of the thermal behavior of the axle-brake systems is an imperative part of the design process of the braking systems in off-highway machinery. The frictional heat generated during repetitive braking cycles under heavy braking loads can cause several negative effects including brake fade, thermal cracks and even fluid vaporization. Despite its significance, limited capability has been developed to predict the thermo-fluids of the wet axle-brake systems. The multi-scale and multi-physics nature of the problem in combination with the significant complexity of the geometries involved renders the application of the common-practice computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods impractical. This paper, proposes a framework for the application of CFD to predict the time-dependent thermo-fluid state of a wet axle-brake system under repetitive braking with varying loads. The thermal model includes full consideration of the heat transfer in the friction pairs, air-oil mixture, and eventually the surrounding solid parts. To achieve this goal, the problem is broken into two sub-problems: the flow between a pair of the friction and separator plates, the global solution of the fluid motion of the air-oil mixture in the housing and eventually the heat transfer In the solid parts. Finally, the temporal evolution of the temperature in both fluid and solid phases predicted by the proposed simulation method, are validated against experimental measurements showing good correlation level.

TI  - Crustal vs. mantle contributions in the Erzgebirge/Krusne hory Mts. magmatism: Implications for generation of zoned, A-type silicic rocks in the late-Variscan Altenberg-Teplice Caldera, Central Europe
VL  - 404
AB  - Late-Variscan (S-, A-type) granites and rhyolitic ignimbrites/lavas (similar to 325 Ma) of the Altenberg-Teplice Caldera (Erzgebirge/Krusne acute accent hory Mts., NW Bohemian Massif) were investigated by using mineral and whole-rock chemistry and Nd-Pb isotopic systematics. Focus was given to the normally zoned Teplice Rhyolite (TR) volcanic successions and, to a lesser extent, the younger comagmatic rapakivi granite porphyry to assess the involvement of magma mixing and to identify differentiation processes in the petrogenesis of A-type rocks. Mineralogical, geochemical, and isotope data disprove A-type magma evolution by closed-system fractional crystallization and favor crystal-liquid separation under complex open-system conditions. Although no compelling mineralogical or chemical evidence for basic-acid magma mixing was found in the caldera, all rocks have constant isotopic fingerprints (epsilon Nd-(i) = -1.9 to -3.7, Pb-207/Pb-204((i)) = 15.53-15.65) and two-stage Nd model ages (T-DM2 = 1.2-1.3 Ga) that represent intermediate ranges between crustal and mantle components of the Cadomian and Lower Paleozoic basement. Thus, the caldera rocks were derived from a heterogeneous source region without basic magma input. The A-type magmas were generated chiefly by biotite dehydration melting of metasediments and non-restitic granodioritic-tonalitic rocks, likely prompted by heat advection from basement exhumation. Contrasting degrees of fertility, together with the distribution of heterogeneous protoliths relative to the heat source, played a critical role in the production of nearly coeval S-and A-type magmas in the Erzgebirge. The shift from S-to A-type magmatism was then controlled by a change in protolith compositions during the late-orogenic regime. Origin of the rapakivi granite porphyry (An(27-43), similar to the TR range) can be explained by self-mixing in the lowest zone of the chamber owing to ponding/recharge of hotter, isotopically similar granitic magma. This study reinforces the idea that generation of A-type rocks and zoned silicic systems does not necessarily require basic magma input despite heterogeneous isotopic fingerprints and presence of rapakivi-textured rocks. The concept of S-and A-type magmas requiring significantly different pressures, H2O contents, and protoliths in the source region does not conform to the Erzgebirge/Krusne acute accent hory Mts. magmatism. Similar pressures and water-absent conditions at the melting site suggest that mixed protoliths and their melting temperatures were the decisive variables in magma production.

AB  - Phytophthora ramorum outbreaks have been documented to occur in natural settings during favourable environmental conditions, and to be caused by the overdominance of highly infectious genotypes. However, little is known about the dynamics of outbreaks in nursery settings. Through the description and quantification of symptoms, as well as through systematic pathogen isolation and genotyping, this study examines the scale and dynamic of spread of four different genotypes of P. ramorum in soil, water and leaves among Rhododendron plants in a nursery setting. Phytophthora ramorum isolation success was highest from leaves and intermediate from soil, reaching peak values at the end of the wet-warm season. The observed disease outbreak was of moderate intensity, and abundance among the four genotypes used as inoculum varied, depending on substrate and isolation time. The spread mechanism of the disease was mostly through leaf-to-leaf contagion, followed by leaf-to-soil, and the scale of pathogen spread was less than 2 m in the 20 months of the experiment. Surprisingly, a large number of novel genotypes were detected during the experiment, and all were clearly derived from the four used as inoculum. The frequency of two such novel genotypes in the post-outbreak phase was comparable to the frequency of some of the original four genotypes, suggesting they may be competitive. The creation of new genotypes in a nursery setting poses a threat to the industry itself, as well as to wildlands, due to the increase in pathogen adaptability often associated with new genetic variation.

TI  - Multi-Objective Sizing Optimization of a Grid-Connected Solar-Wind Hybrid System Using Climate Classification: A Case Study of Four Locations in Southern Taiwan
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
AB  - Increased concerns over global warming and air pollution has pushed governments to consider renewable energy as an alternative to meet the required energy demands of countries. Many government policies are deployed in Taiwan to promote solar and wind energy to cope with air pollution and self-dependency for energy generation. However, the residential sector contribution is not significant despite higher feed-in tariff rates set by government. This study analyzes wind and solar power availability of four different locations of southern Taiwan, based on the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system. The solar-wind hybrid system (SWHS) considered in this study consists of multi-crystalline photovoltaic (PV) modules, vertical wind turbines, inverters and batteries. Global reanalysis weather data and a climate-based electricity load profile at a 1-h resolution was used for the simulation. A general framework for multi-objective optimization using this simulation technique is proposed for solar-wind hybrid system, considering the feed-in tariff regulations, environmental regulations and installation area constraints of Taiwan. The hourly load profile is selected using a climate classification system. A decomposition-based differential evolutionary algorithm is used for finding the optimal Pareto set of two economic objectives and one environmental objective with maximum installation area and maximum PV capacity constraints. Two types of buildings are chosen for analysis at four climate locations. Analysis of Pareto sets revealed that the photovoltaic modules are economic options for a grid-connected mode at all four locations, whereas solar-wind hybrid systems are more environmentally friendly. A method of finding the fitness index for the Pareto front sets and a balanced strategy for choosing the optimal configuration is proposed. The proposed balanced strategy provides savings to users-up to 49% for urban residential buildings and up to 32% for rural residential buildings with respect to buildings without a hybrid energy system (HES)-while keeping carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions lower than 50% for the total project lifecycle time of 20 years. The case study reveals that for all four locations and two building types an HES system comprising a 15 kW photovoltaic system and a small capacity battery bank provides the optimal balance between economic and environmental objectives.

VL  - 76

SP  - 333-340
AB  - Pupae of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), were maintained in the laboratory for emergence under selected constant and fluctuating temperatures and humidities. Temperatures ranged from 10 to 40-degrees-C, with a vapor pressure deficiency maintained constant at 8.5 mb in one study. No eclosion occurred at 10-degrees-C or at 40-degrees-C. Insects held at 15 and 35-degrees-C had low survival and a high percentage (39-62%) were deformed. The optimum rate of development occurred at 30 and 35-degrees-C, but a high percentage (58% of males, 39% of females) of the insects held at 35-degrees-C emerged deformed. In a comparison between the constant and fluctuating temperatures (the mean of the fluctuating temperature equalled the constant temperature treatment), survival was not affected, but development was generally faster with the fluctuating treatment. In another study, relative humidity ranged from 20 to about 100% (33.9 to about 0 mb) and was maintained at 30-degrees-C. Percentage survival, rate of development, or percent deformity were not affected by humidity. Weight loss was similar among insects held under different humidity treatments and was not affected by constant or fluctuating condition. Although survival was the same for the sexes, females developed at a faster rate and a smaller percentage emerged deformed as compared with males.

VL  - 16
IS  - 7
AB  - Adaptive coloration among animals is one of the most recognizable outcomes of natural selection. Here, we investigate evolutionary drivers of white coloration in velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae), which has previously been considered camouflage with the fruit of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). Our analyses indicate instead that velvet ants evolved white coloration millions of years before creosote bush was widespread in North America's hot deserts. Furthermore, velvet ants and the creosote fruit exhibit different spectral reflectance patterns, which appear distinct to potential insectivorous predators. While the white coloration in velvet ants likely did not evolve as camouflage, we find that white-coloured species remain cooler than their red/orange relatives, and therefore we infer the white coloration likely evolved in response to Neogene desertification. This study shows the importance of cross-disciplinary investigation and of testing multiple hypotheses when investigating evolutionary drivers of adaptive coloration.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert chemical energy to electrical energy via electrochemically active microorganisms. The interactions between microbes and the surface of a carbon electrode play a vital role in capturing the respiratory electrons from bacteria. Therefore, improvements in the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of carbon materials are essential for increasing performance. In this study, a microwave and sulfuric acid treatment was used to modify the surface structure of graphite granules. The prepared expandable graphite granules (EGG) exhibited a 1.5 times higher power den-sity than the unmodified graphite granules (1400 vs. 900 mW/m ). Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed improved physical and chemical characteristics of the EGG surface. These results suggest that physical and chemical surface modification using sulfuric acid and microwave heating improves the performance of electrode-based bioprocesses, such as MFCs.

TI  - Role of thermal environment in habitat selection by male white-tailed deer during summer in Texas, USA
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-56
AB  - Thermal cover may influence habitat selection by white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in subtropical climates with hot summers. We 1) tested the hypothesis that thermal environment is more important in habitat selection at midday during summer than forage quality or quantity and concealment cover and 2) determined whether operative temperature, vegetation height, or woody plant canopy cover (or some combination of these) explain habitat selection at midday. We predicted that during crepuscular periods and at night habitat use increases with increasing forage quality and quantity and concealment cover and is unrelated to thermal environment. Male white-tailed deer were fitted with GPS collars to determine resources selected within habitats during June and July 2008 and 2009. A generalized linear mixed model using logistic regression was used to estimate resource selection functions. We used the first principal component in a principal components analysis (PCA) of forage standing crop, crude protein, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) to create a 'forage index'. This index and vegetation height, operative temperature and concealment cover, together with their interactions with activity period, were used to develop a priori candidate models. Akaike weights were used to compare candidate models. A model that included the forage index, vegetation height, operative temperature, concealment cover and their interactions with activity period was the best model out of 97 candidate models for explaining habitat selection by adult male white-tailed deer. Male white-tailed deer selected areas with taller vegetation in morning and midday activity periods but selected shorter vegetation during evening and nighttime. Forage quality was important in habitat selection in all activity periods. Male white-tailed deer did not select areas with greater concealment cover during any activity period. A combination of operative temperature, vegetation height, and woody plant canopy cover predicted midday habitat use better than any of these three variables alone. Thermoregulatory behavior in male white-tailed appears to include a combination of seeking cooler environments during midday but at the same time using areas with greater forage quality.

TI  - REEBOX PRO: A forward model simulating melting of thermally and lithologically variable upwelling mantle
VL  - 17
IS  - 10
SP  - 3929-3968
AB  - The compositions and volumes of basalts erupted in divergent margin environments provide a record of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical state of their mantle source regions. To relate basalt compositions and volumes to the underlying thermochemical and dynamical state of their mantle source regions, we have developed REEBOX PRO, a compiled stand-alone application that simulates adiabatic decompression melting of passively or actively upwelling mantle containing up to five distinct lithologies. The model calculates melt compositions using thermodynamic and experimental constraints on the melting behaviors and mineral-melt partitioning behavior of homogeneous and lithologically heterogeneous mantle sources containing anhydrous peridotite, hydrous peridotite, harzburgite, and/or silica-saturated/-undersaturated pyroxenite. Key model outputs include the mean composition and crustal thickness for the bulk basaltic crust, calculated for passive and active upwelling scenarios. Here, we present the mathematical formulations underlying the model and benchmark it against existing hydrous melting models and models for mid-ocean ridge basalt formation. We show that the hydrous and anhydrous peridotite melting models incorporated in REEBOX PRO capture the essential differences in basalt composition and volume demonstrated by previous models, and constrain the ambient mantle beneath the global spreading ridge system to be between 1319 and 1366 degrees C, depending on the relative fertility and/or water content of the mid-ocean ridge mantle source. We also show how model outputs may be manipulated outside of the modeling program to calculate nontraditional melt mixing scenarios. These examples highlight the flexibility of REEBOX PRO for simulating melt generation within a range of geodynamical contexts.

VL  - 65

SP  - 1399-1409
AB  - Introduced plants provide a unique opportunity to examine how plants respond through plasticity and adaptation to changing climates. We compared plants of Spartina alterniflora from the native (United States, 27-43 degrees N) and introduced (China, 19-40 degrees N) ranges. In the field and greenhouse, aboveground productivity of Chinese plants was greater than that of North American plants. Aboveground biomass in the field declined with increasing latitude in the native range, a pattern that persisted in the greenhouse, indicating a genetic basis. Aboveground biomass in the field displayed hump-shaped relationships with latitude in China, but this pattern disappeared in field and greenhouse common gardens, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Relationships in both geographic regions were explained by temperature, which is probably the underlying environmental factor affecting aboveground biomass. S. alterniflora has evolved greater biomass in China, but in the four decades since it was introduced, it has not yet evolved the genetic cline in biomass seen in its native range. By working at lower latitudes in the introduced range than have been sampled in the native range, we identified an optimum temperature in the introduced range above which aboveground productivity decreases.

TI  - Enhancing the Thermal Robustness of an Enzyme by Directed Evolution: Least Favorable Starting Points and Inferior Mutants Can Map Superior Evolutionary Pathways
VL  - 12
IS  - 16
SP  - 2502-2510
AB  - In a previous directed evolution study, the BFIT approach to increasing the thermal robustness of proteins was introduced and applied to the lipase from Bacillus subtilis. It is based on the general concept of iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM), according to which sites in an enzyme are subjected to saturation mutagenesis, the best hit of a given library is then used as a template for randomization at other sites, and the process is continued until the desired catalyst improvement has been achieved. The appropriate choice of the ISM sites is crucial; in the BFIT method the criterion is residues characterized by highest B factors available from Xray crystallography data. In the present study, BFIT was employed in order to increase the thermal robustness of the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger. Several rounds of ISM resulted in the best variant showing a 21 degrees C increase in the T-50(60) value, an 80-fold improvement in half-life at 60 degrees C, and a 44 kcal mol(-1) improvement in inactivation energy. Seven other variants were also evolved with moderate yet significant improvements; these were characterized by 10-14 degrees C increases in T-50(60), 20-30-fold improvement in half-lives at 60 degrees C and 15-20 kcal mol(-1) elevations in activation energy. Unexpectedly, in the ISM process the best variants were obtained from essentially neutral or even inferior mutant parents, that is, when a given library contains no improved mutants. This constitutes a practical way to escape from what appear to be local minima ("dead ends") in the fitness landscape-a finding of notable significance in directed evolution.

SP  - 315-320
AB  - In vitro culture offers approaches to study cellular responses and to obtain cells tolerant to high temperature stress. The objectives of this study were to select wheat cells that tolerate high temperature stress, study cell line stability and cytogenetic characteristics, and compare protein synthesis in selected and control cell lines after exposure to heat stress. Three of 600 colonies plated were recovered after cells had been exposed to 48-degrees-C. Forty-five percent of the cells of the tolerant cell line, M48 survived when they were returned to a normal temperature (22-degrees-C) for 6 mo and rechallenged with a 48-degrees-C treatment. The control cell line exhibited 0.8% survival under this treatment. Chromosomal elimination and genomic rearrangements were observed extensively for the cell lines before and after heat selection. Heat selection did enhance the occurrence of polytene chromosomes and the frequency of extrachromosomal DNA. When cell viability was evaluated in cell suspension cultures, M48 had a higher percentage of viable cells than the control cell line. Analysis of S-35-methionine in vivo labeled proteins showed that the selected M48 cell line maintained the synthesis of most normal proteins under a heat shock of 40-degrees-C for 4 h, with synthesis of several unique low molecular weight heat-shock proteins (HSPs). A quantitative increase in high molecular weight HSPs was also observed in this cell line. This study demonstrated that a heat-tolerant cell line of wheat can be obtained from in vitro selection, and that this phenomenon was associated with the synthesis of specific proteins under heat stress.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THERMAL REGIME ALTERATION AND SPAWNING DELAY OF THE FOUR MAJOR CHINESE CARPS IN THE YANGTZE RIVER BELOW THE THREE GORGES DAM
VL  - 30
IS  - 8
SP  - 987-1001
AB  - Large dams often alter flow and thermal regimes downstream, resulting in fish spawning delays and larval abundance declines. Accurate prediction of the delayed spawning period under changed thermal regime is critical for selecting a correct timing to modify dam operation and to release the environmental flow needed to enhance fish spawning. We used correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between thermal regime alteration and spawning delay of the four major Chinese carps (FMCC) below the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River, China, using a 13-year ecological data series (1997-2009). Eighteen variables were defined to quantify thermal regime and related to two variables representing spawning timing. Our results demonstrate that the start of FMCC spawning has been delayed from early May to middle June since the Three Gorges Dam initiated operation in 2003. Water temperature declines of 2 degrees C-4 degrees C in March, April and May (a critical period for gonad development) were the principal reason for the observed spawning delay. The variable most associated with spawning timing was the arrival date of the cumulative temperature needed for gonad development from stages IV to V (DDegDayIV-V), which describes the long-term impacts of the timing, magnitude and duration of thermal regime upon gonad development. Only the cumulative temperature for gonad development and the minimum temperature for FMCC spawning (18 degrees C) are both satisfied, the occurrence of suitable flow conditions, that is, flow increase or flash flood, would produce a successful spawning event. Consequently, we suggest that the experimental flow increase process of the Three Gorges Reservoir aimed at enhancing FMCC spawning should initiate after 15 June when the requisite thermal regime can be met.

AB  - Gynogenetic diploid induced by retaining second polar body and that by suppressing first cleavage of eggs of Indonesian common carp Cyprinus carpio were produced by inseminating eggs with ultra-violet ray irradiated sperm of Java carp Puntius gonionotus and giving heat shock treatment to the developing eggs. The morphometric and meristic characters of 3 month old fish were measured and counted. There was the prominent trend that the degree of phenotypic variation was larger in the mitotic- and meiotic-gynogenetic diploids than in the control-2N in the almost all morphological characters examined. These phenomena observed in variation of quantitative characters were explained by the function showing the relationship among phenotypic variance (V(p)), genetic variance (V(g)), environmental variance (V(e)) and coefficient of inbreeding (F) in the first gynogenetic generation. The genetic implications for gynogenetic diploids were discussed in relation to genetic improvement of fish race in aquaculture.

TI  - CLIMATE CHANGE - PROBABLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEMS (SES) IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACTS IN THE ANTHROPOCENE EPOCH
VL  - 21
SP  - 308-317
AB  - It is vital for security experts to learn from the historical records of global climate change as to how the human society has been impacted by its consequences in the "new" Anthropocene Epoch. Some of these consequences of global climate change include the perishing of several human settlements in different parts of the globe at different times, e.g., in 1700 B.C., prolonged drought contributed to the demise of Harappan civilization in northwest India. In 1200 B.C., under a similar climatic extremity, the Mycenaean civilization in present-day Greece (as well as the Mill Creek culture of the northwestern part of the present-day US state of Iowa) perished. Why did some societies under such climatic events perish while others survived? Lack of preparedness of one society and its failure to anticipate and adapt to the extreme climatic events might have attributed to their extinction. The authors will also analyze the extinction of one European Norse society in Greenland during the Little Ice Age (about 600 years ago), as compared to the still-surviving Inuit society in the northern segment of Greenland, which faced even harsher climatic conditions during the Little Ice Age than the extinct Norsemen. This is how the adaptability and "expectation of the worst" matter for the survival of a particular community against climatic "black swan" events (Taleb, 2007). Similar impacts in terms of sea-level rise expected by the year 2100 whereby major human populations of many parts of the world are expected to lose their environmental evolutionary "niche" will be discussed. Rising temperature will not only complicate human health issues, but also will it take its toll on the staple food producing agricultural belts in some latitudinal expanse. It will also worsen the living condition of the populace living in areas where climate is marginal. Through the Socio-Economic Systems Model provided by Vadineanu (2001), the authors will next consider the effect of extant policy-making "prisms" responding to climate change (such as the "Club of Rome" versus the "Club for Growth" visions) as concerns the ongoing process of globalization and survival of the nation-state.

VL  - 27

SP  - 2680-2697
AB  - Skin pigmentation and coat pigmentation are two of the best-studied examples of traits under natural selection given their quantifiable fitness interactions with the environment (e.g., camouflage) and signalling with other organisms (e.g., warning coloration). Previous morphological studies have found that skin pigmentation variation in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is associated with variation in precipitation and temperatures across its distribution range following Gloger's rule (lighter pigmentation in temperate environments). To investigate the molecular mechanism associated with skin pigmentation variation, we used RNA-Seq and quantified gene expression of wild opossums from tropical and temperate populations. Using differential expression analysis and a co-expression network approach, we found that expression variation in genes with melanocytic and immune functions is significantly associated with the degree of skin pigmentation variation and may be underlying this phenotypic difference. We also found evidence suggesting that the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway might be regulating the depigmentation observed in temperate populations. Based on our study results, we present several alternative hypotheses that may explain Gloger's rule pattern of skin pigmentation variation in opossum, including changes in pathogen diversity supporting a pathogen-resistant hypothesis, thermal stress associated with temperate environments, and pleiotropic and epistatic interactions between melanocytic and immune genes.

TI  - Potential Suitable Habitat of Two Economically Important Forest Trees (Acer truncatum and Xanthoceras sorbifolium) in East Asia under Current and Future Climate Scenarios
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - Acer truncatum Bunge and Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge are small deciduous trees distributed in East Asia and have high ecological and nutrient value due to their strong environmental adaptability and seed oil abundant in nervonic acid and unsaturated fatty acids. However, their natural distribution remains unclear, which will also be affected by the changing climatic conditions. The main purpose of this study was to map and predict the current and future potential suitable habitats of these two species using MaxEnt based on the presence location of species and environmental variables. The results showed that A. truncatum was more suitable for warm and humid climates and was more durable to climate change compared to X. sorbifolium. Under the current environmental conditions, the suitable habitat of A. truncatum was mainly concentrated in Inner Mongolia Plateau, Loess Plateau, Sichuan Basin, Northeast Plain, North China Plain, Korean Peninsula, as well as Japan, with an area of 115.39 x 10(4) km(2). X. sorbifolium was mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia Plateau and Loess Plateau with an area of 146.15 x 10(4) km(2). Under future climate scenarios, the model predicted that higher concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions could result in greater expansion of the potential distribution of both species. Meanwhile, the study also revealed that the two species migrated to the north by east to varying degrees with the change in suitable habitats. This work could provide scientific basis for resource protection and utilization of the two economic forest trees.

TI  - Analysis of DNA methylation level by methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism in half smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) subjected to salinity stress
VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 269-278
AB  - Increasingly arisen environmental constraints may contribute to heritable phenotypic variation including methylation changes, which can help the animals with development, growth and survival. In this study, we assessed the DNA methylation levels in three tissues (gonad, kidney and gill) of half smooth tongue sole under the salinity stress. The methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique was applied to illustrate the regulation of epigenetic mechanism in environmental stimuli. Fish were subjected to 15 salinity treatment for 7 and 60 days, respectively. A total of 11259 fragments were amplified with 8 pairs of selective primers. The levels of methylated DNA in different tissues of females and males without salinity stress were analyzed, which were 32.76% and 47.32% in gonad; 38.13% and 37.69% in kidney; 37.58% and 34.96% in gill, respectively. In addition, the significant difference was observed in gonad between females and males, indicating that discrepant regulation in gonadal development and differentiation may involve sex-related genes. Further analysis showed that total and hemi-methylation were significantly decreased under 15 salinity for 7 days, probably resulting in up-regulating salt-tolerance genes expression to adjust salt changing. With the adjustment for 60 days, total and hemi-methylation prominently went back to its normal levels to obtain equilibrium. Particularly, full methylation levels were steady along with salinity stress to maintain the stability of gene expression. Additionally, the data showed that gonads in females and gills in males were superior in adaptability. As a result, DNA methylation regulates tissue- specific epiloci, and may respond to salinity stress by regulating gene expression to maintain animal survival and activity.

VL  - 37
IS  - 8
SP  - 1669-1677
AB  - To promote the economic feasibility of Nannochloropsis oculata, efficacy of using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase microalgal growth and lipid accumulation was investigated. We first examined the effects of PEG concentrations on microalgal growth using 0-5 % (w/v) PEG-6000, and followed by exploring the effects of PEG molecular weights (400, 600, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 20,000) on microalgal growth, size, as well as on yields of biomass, total lipids, and eicosapentaenoic acid. In addition, the capacity of PEG to reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition on microalgal growth was also investigated to evaluate its adaptability for use in large-scale and closed setting. Our results showed that PEG-induced osmotic stress (I ) in the range of 2.465-2.472 MPa can raise microalgal growth. The PEG with higher molecular weight exhibited greater efficacy of growth promotion but less lipid content under equal concentration. In this study, 0.5 % (w/v) PEG-20000 (I = 2.466 MPa) remarkably enhanced microalgal growth without interference of intracellular lipid productivity and cellular size, yielding > 50 % (w/w) increases in biomass, total lipid, and eicosapentaenoic acid amounts after 7 days that provided the optimal condition for microalgal cultivation. These positive effects possibly resulted from the moderate enhancement of osmotic stress in the medium and stronger chaotrope-like behavior from higher molecular weight PEG. With further verification that 0.5 % (w/v) PEG-20000 enabled to reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition on microalgal growth, the PEG-20000-mediated cultivation offers a feasible means for mass culture of N. oculata in closed setting.

TI  - Fine-Scale Analysis of the Energy-Land-Water Nexus: Nitrate Leaching Implications of Biomass Cofiring in the Midwestern United States
VL  - 54
IS  - 4
SP  - 2122-2132
AB  - As scientists seek to better understand the linkages between energy, water, and land systems, they confront a critical question of scale for their analysis. Many studies exploring this nexus restrict themselves to a small area in order to capture fine-scale processes, whereas other studies focus on interactions between energy, water, and land over broader domains but apply coarse resolution methods. Detailed studies of a narrow domain can be misleading if the policy intervention considered is broad-based and has impacts on energy, land, and agricultural markets. Regional studies with aggregate low-resolution representations may miss critical feedbacks driven by the dynamic interactions between subsystems. This study applies a novel, gridded energy-land-water modeling system to analyze the local environmental impacts of biomass cofiring of coal power plants across the upper MISO region. We use this framework to examine the impacts of a hypothetical biomass cofiring technology mandate of coal-fired power plants using corn residues. We find that this scenario has a significant impact on land allocation, fertilizer applications, and nitrogen leaching. The effects also impact regions not involved in cofiring through agricultural markets. Further, some MISO coal-fired plants would cease generation because the competition for biomass increases the cost of this feedstock and because the higher operating costs of cofiring renders them uncompetitive with other generation sources. These factors are not captured by analyses undertaken at the level of an individual power plant. We also show that a region-wide analysis of this cofiring mandate would have registered only a modest increase in nitrate leaching (just +5% across the upper MISO region). Such aggregate analyses would have obscured the extremely large increases in leaching at particular locations, as much as +60%. Many of these locations are already pollution hotspots. Fine-scale analysis, nested within a broader framework, is necessary to capture these critical environmental interactions within the energy, land, and water nexus.

TI  - Modeling Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers In Severe Climate
VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-149
AB  - Harsh weather conditions often require heating during winters and cooling in summers. In many developing countries, power outages caused by energy shortages cause discomfort for the residents. Thus, more sustainable systems for air conditioning are desirable in these countries. The present study proposes an examination of the viability of Earth-to-Air Heat Ex-changers (EAHE) in severe environments (extreme summer and winter seasons) and comprises numerical modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics. In most existing studies, EAHE systems are examined and validated for particular field conditions. Despite the valuable information from these studies, it is vital to perform investigations within a regional context, considering specific environmental conditions at the regional scale. The current research addresses the performance of Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers in a severe climate typical of the region of Islamabad. To this end, thermal properties are selected according to soil profiles specific of this region. The annual mean earth temperature is carefully chosen from RETScreen daily records in the same region. Models are tested against analytic solutions in a 2-D context and validated using large-scale field tests. The complete numerical model integrates heat transfer in the ground where em-bedded piping is subject to air circulation. Heat transfer occurs between the piping system and the surrounding soil, which results in heating or cooling of the circulating air mass, depending on the seasonal conditions. The results obtained in field conditions validated by actual experiments show interesting predictions of air temperatures at the outlet even in a severe climate. This depicts that ground temperatures preserved from climatic conditions can benefit EAHE systems even in severe climate conditions.

VL  - 24
IS  - 18
SP  - 4723-4738
AB  - The ecological and genetic factors determining the extent of introgression between species in secondary contact zones remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the relative importance of isolating barriers and the demographic expansion of invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis on the magnitude and the direction of introgression with the native Mytilus trossulus in a hybrid zone in central California. We use double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to genotype 1337 randomly selected single nucleotide polymorphisms and accurately distinguish early and advanced generation hybrids for the first time in the central California Mytilus spp. hybrid zone. Weak levels of introgression were observed in both directions but were slightly more prevalent from the native M. trossulus into the invasive M. galloprovincialis. Few early and advanced backcrossed individuals were observed across the hybrid zone confirming the presence of strong barriers to interbreeding. Heterogeneous patterns of admixture across the zone of contact were consistent with the colonization history of M. galloprovincialis with more extensive introgression in northern localities furthest away from the putative site of introduction in southern California. These observations reinforce the importance of dynamic spatial and demographic expansions in determining patterns of introgression between close congeners, even in those with high dispersal potential and well-developed reproductive barriers. Our results suggest that the threat posed by invasive M. galloprovincialis is more ecological than genetic as it has displaced, and continues to displace the native M. trossulus from much of central and southern California.

TI  - Mafic precursors, peraluminous granitoids, and late lamprophyres in the Avila batholith: A model for the generation of Variscan batholiths in Iberia
VL  - 107
IS  - 4
SP  - 399-419
AB  - The Avila batholith of central Spain is composed of upper Carboniferous peraluminous granitoids that were preceded by volumetrically insignificant bodies of mafic-ultramafic hybrid magmas and postdated by several dike swarms of camptonitic lamprophyres. Rb-Sr dating indicates continuous magmatic activity from similar to 350 Ma to similar to 280 Ma, starting with the mafic precursors and a few midcrustal anatectic leucogranites, followed by massive autochthonous and allochthonous granodiorites and granites, and ending with the camptonitic lamprophyres. Early hybrid mafic magmas (epsilon(340Ma) Sr similar to 25; epsilon(340Ma) Nd similar to -1.5) were produced in small batches during or immediately after the main deformation phase, probably by the partial melting of a mixture of similar to 8 :2 mantle and biotite-bearing crustal rocks at the crust-mantle interface. These magmas were emplaced in the middle crust at similar to 340 Ma, advecting a negligible amount of heat. The generation of crustal granites during the main deformation phase was very scarce and limited to highly fertile protoliths, rich in heat-producing elements, affected by strong shear zones. The generation of crustal granitoids on a batholithic scale took place from similar to 330 Ma to similar to 290 Ma, during the main extensional period. Granites (epsilon(310Ma) Sr similar to 45-150; epsilon(310Ma) Nd similar to-2.1 to -9) were produced by the partial melting of fertile crustal rocks (epsilon(310Ma) Sr similar to 48-218; epsilon(310Ma) Nd similar to 2.2 to -9), characterized by high heat production (similar to 2.5-3 mu W m(-3)). The zone of partial melting, similar to 15-22 km in depth, was heated by thermal conduction from below after crustal thinning, but the contribution of radiogenic heat and the fertility of source rocks would have been essential for anatexis. The fast thinning of the crust from similar to 310 Ma to similar to 285 Ma released lithostatic pressure in the upper mantle and caused decompressional melting of the metasome layer at similar to 60-85 km in depth, producing camptonitic melts dated at similar to 283 Ma. The existence of a fertile metasome layer implies that the lithospheric mantle beneath central Iberia was not actively involved in subduction during the Variscan orogeny.

VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 15-26
AB  - Overwintering females of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni) entered a reproductive diapause, and the ovary development in females collected before December 22 was retarded at 20 C under short (L10 : D14) and long (L15 : D9) days. In contrast, ovarian eggs in females collected after the beginning of the year developed normally. I examined the effects of temperature on the development of overwintering females that infested tea branches and on the hatch of the first generation at various constant temperatures. The base temperature was determined to be 10.5 degreesC and 10.9 degreesC for 50% of the females to begin laying eggs and for the egg hatch to reach a peak, respectively. Seasonal changes in oviposition of the overwintering generation and hatch of the first generation were monitored from 1998-2002 at Kanaya, Shizuoka Prefecture. When the base temperature was assumed to be 10.5 C and day-degrees (DD) were summed from January 1, 50% of the females began laying eggs when an average of 149 DD had accumulated, and the peak of hatching coincided with an average of 288 DD. The logistic equation y=1/[1+exp{-(alpha(0) + alpha(1)x)}] (y, proportion of parous females or hatch; x, DD accumulations; alpha(0) and alpha(1), constants) was used to model a sequence of the population events and to predict the optimum timing of insecticide application for controlling the first-generation larvae of P. pentagona.

TI  - Making Archean cratonic roots by lateral compression: A two-stage thickening and stabilization model
VL  - 746
SP  - 562-571
AB  - Archean tectonics was capable of producing virtually indestructible cratonic mantle lithosphere, but the dominant mechanism of this process remains a topic of considerable discussion. Recent geophysical and petrological studies have refuelled the debate by suggesting that thickening and associated vertical movement of the cratonic mantle lithosphere after its formation are essential ingredients of the cratonization process. Here we present a geodynamical study that focuses on how the thick stable cratonic lithospheric roots can be made in a thermally evolving mantle. Our numerical experiments explore the viability of a cratonization process in which depleted mantle lithosphere grows via lateral compression into a >200-km thick, stable cratonic root and on what time-scales this may happen. Successful scenarios for craton formation, within the bounds of our models, are found to be composed of two stages: an initial phase of tectonic shortening and a later phase of gravitational self-thickening. The initial tectonic shortening of previously depleted mantle material is essential to initiate the cratonization process, while the subsequent gravitational self-thickening contributes to a second thickening phase that is comparable in magnitude to the initial tectonic phase. Our results show that a combination of intrinsic compositional buoyancy of the cratonic root, rapid cooling of the root after shortening, and the long-term secular cooling of the mantle prevents a Rayleigh-Taylor type collapse, and will stabilize the thick cratonic root for future preservation. This two-stage thickening model provides a geodynamically viable cratonization scenario that is consistent with petrological and geophysical constraints.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF CONSANGUINITY ON THE SEX-RATIO AND DIAPAUSE OF DIPRION-PINI L (HYM, DIPRIONIDE) POPULATIONS .1. OBSERVATIONS ON A REARING POPULATION - RELATION WITH THE SEX DETERMINISM AND CONSANGUINITY
VL  - 118
IS  - 3
SP  - 267-280
AB  - Observations made on a rearing population of Diprion pini L. bred since more than 30 generations in photoperiodic and thermic conditions favourable to without-diapause development, show that during the first reared generations sex-ratio evolued rapidly in favour of males while diapause rate highly increased, reaching more than 90% of individuals. Then diapause rates decreased gradually, after what, stay devinitively to a low level, while males remain much more numerous than females. These observations suggest a high consanguinity in rearing populations and that the increasing diapause rates, that are not without analogy with diapause variations during outbreaks of natural populations, may be linked with this consanguinity. Initial diapause rate recovery will result in the selection realised by the reproduction of the without diapause individuals only at every generation. The hypothesis is further advanced that the increase in males may result in a sex determinism well-known for some Hymenoptera and at least for a Diprionidae that involve the production of diploid males favoured by consanguinity. This phenomenon may be at the origin of observed diapause rate variations. Several factors such as insect weight, wing setae number and, in particular, the presence of heterozygote males in natural populations corroborate the existence of diploid males for D. pini. The existence of gynandromorphs in nature as in laboratory populations may also constitute an indicator of the consanguinity. Consanguine crossings realised between brother-sister insects through several generations reproduce the phenomena seen in rearing quite faithfully, as much for diapause as sex-ratio.

VL  - 10
IS  - 36
SP  - 18834-18844
AB  - Large tablet controlled-release fertilizers (LCRFs) can significantly improve nutrient utilization and reduce coating costs. However, traditional petrochemical coating materials are expensive and non-renewable. Furthermore, conventional heat-curing coating process is both time and energy consuming and severely impairs the controlled-release characteristics of LCRFs. To solve above problems, green processes using renewable biomaterials have become the research hotspot for the new generation of LCRFs. In this work, bio-based polyurethane acrylate (BPUA), synthesized from castor oil, was used to coat large tablet by an innovative UV-curing process for controlled-release fertilizer to overcome the drawbacks of the heat-curing process. Furthermore, BPUA was modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and thiol grafted nanosilica (TNS) to prepare dense and superhydrophobic biopolymer-coated large tablet controlled-release fertilizer (DSBCF). The DSBCF exhibited remarkable controlled-release characteristics with a nitrogen release longevity of nearly 120 days, requiring only 4% of the coating materials. This research provides an efficient UV-curing strategy to manufacture energy saving, superior performance and biopolymer-coated LCRFs. It can solve bottlenecks that limit the development of coated fertilizers and provide theoretical and technical support for the green upgrade of the industry.

TI  - Assessment of Agricultural Biomass Residues for Anaerobic Digestion in Rural Vakinankaratra Region of Madagascar
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
SP  - 1251-1264
AB  - This study estimates agricultural residue biomass available for biogas generation in smallholder farming systems in the rural Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar, during 2017-2018. Estimations of biomass were done using a combination of agricultural household surveys, literature models, and publicly available data. Manure from four types of farm animals and 17 residue types from ten crops were assessed. In the studied period, gross biomass produced from animal manure and crop residue were 19.4 +/- 7.41 and 7.3 +/- 1.08 tonnes fresh weight per year per agricultural household, respectively, of which up to 54% and 83% are estimated as recoverable for the production of bioenergy in the studied area, respectively. Estimations indicate that available animal manure and crop residue have the potential to generate 291 +/- 92 and 745 +/- 122 Nm(3) of methane per year per agricultural household respectively, equivalent to 10.5 +/- 3.34 and 26.8 +/- 4.28 GJ of heat energy from manure and residues, respectively. Theoretically, the average estimated energy potential can result in the complete substitution of domestic fuels in agricultural households. Approximately 0.12 tonnes of nitrogen per household per year can be recovered from the estimated digestate (using all residue types) after energy recovery, which can be employed for crop fertilization. The recovered nitrogen corresponds to 0.26 tonnes urea fertilizer per household per year. The investigation shows that anaerobic digestion based on crop residue and manure has the potential to meet a significant portion of energy needs of smallholder farmers in the Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar and can make an important contribution to providing fertilizer for on-farm use.

TI  - Effects of dispersal, predators (Acari : Phytoseiidae), weather, and ground cover treatments on populations of Tetranychus urticae (Acari : Tetranychidae) in apple orchards
VL  - 98
IS  - 3
SP  - 862-874
AB  - In a 2-yr study of causes of mite outbreaks in apple (Males spp.) orchards in Nova Scotia, we monitored immigration of Tetranychus urticae Koch from orchard ground cover into trees populated by the generalist phytoseiid predator Typhlodroinus pyri Scheuten. In both years, T. urticae-days in the tree canopy increased with number of T. urticae caught in sticky bands on tree trunks. In 2000, T. urticae-days were negatively correlated with T. pyri-days. Lack of correlation in 2001 was attributed to higher rates of immigration, which would mask the effects of predation. Weather also affected mite dynamics. Rainfall in July and August was less in 2001 than in 2000. Heat units were sufficient for six generations of T. urticae in 2001 but only for five in 2000. Consequently, T. urticae-days in the tree canopy and immigration rates were significantly greater in 2001 than in 2000, despite three-fold greater use of miticides. We also tested the effects of herbicides on T. urticae immigration. Application of selective herbicides in laneways reduced coverage of reproductive hosts of T. urticae, but these changes did not reduce immigration. In 2001, application of a miticidal herbicide, glufosinate, in tree rows reduced captures of T. urticae on sticky bands in high immigration orchards but not in low immigration orchards. We conclude that generalist predators and modified herbicide use are insufficient remedies and that effective biological control of T. urticae in the ground cover by a specialist phytoseiid such as Amblyseius fallacis Garman is essential to prevent outbreaks.

TI  - The petrogenesis of anorogenic felsic magmas and AMCG suites: Insights on element mobility and mutual cryptic contamination from polythermal experiments
VL  - 151
SP  - 35-45
AB  - The close association of mantle-derived mafic rocks and crust-derived felsic rocks in AMCG suites the world over is now interpreted in terms of delamination of the lithospheric keel of an orogen within a short time after the cessation of a major collision. The stage is set for the ascent of an asthenospheric diapir, which is accompanied by the ascent of a stream of H2O-CO2 representing regional degassing of the mantle in the ensuing extensional setting. The crust gets variably metasomatized prior to melting, and this episode of melting seems to involve almost complete melting rather than the expected films of leucosome. Results of polythermal experiments with a large array of target rocks (pulverized) + H2O show that it is possible to mobilize the major elements K, Na, Al, Si and Fe such that the transported fractions resembles an A-type granite or syenite. The open-system process increases in efficiency with increasing temperature and increasing pressure. A stream of such fluid interacting with gabbro or basic magma could create anorthositic and ultrabasic assemblages that are candidates for contamination of pools of basic magma in the uppermost mantle and lower crust. The same stream continues its buoyant rise and makes over the sterile granulitic lower and middle crust into a geochemically fertile protolith for the generation of A-type felsic magmas by wholesale anatexis.

VL  - 222
IS  - 1
SP  - 29-43
AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts originating from wild (Imsa) and selected (AquaGen) strains were maintained on simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) or constant light (LL) in replicate tanks between 3 December 1998 and 26 May 1999. Gill Na+,K-ATPase activity, plasma growth hormone (GH) levels, condition factor (CF) as well as individual food intake, growth and food conversion were monitored regularly in all groups during the experimental period. Freshwater temperature was kept constant at approximately 12 degreesC. In both strains, GH levels and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity rose steadily in the SNP groups, whereas the abrupt increase in day-length caused a significant increase in GH levels within 4 weeks, concurrent with an increase gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The close relationship between GH levels and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity indicates that GH plays and important role in the development of hypoosmoregulatory ability during smolting. Overall, a higher growth rate was seen in smolts from the AquaGen strain compared with the Imsa strain. No differences in food consumption were seen between strains, whereas an improved food conversion was observed in smolts from the AquaGen strain. Photoperiod was found to enhance growth through stimulation of food intake. It is concluded that the observed differences in growth and food conversion between wild and selected smolts are genetic, and probably reflect the fact that the AquaGen fish have been bred for rapid growth for several generations.

TI  - High cell density perfusion process for high yield of influenza A virus production using MDCK suspension cells
VL  - 105
IS  - 4
SP  - 1421-1434
AB  - Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log(10)(HAU/100 mu L)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 x 10(6) cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log(10)(HAU/100 mu L) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 x 10(10) virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness.

TI  - The role of N2O derived from crop-based biofuels, and from agriculture in general, in Earth's climate
VL  - 367
IS  - 1593
SP  - 1169-1174
AB  - In earlier work, we compared the amount of newly fixed nitrogen (N, as synthetic fertilizer and biologically fixed N) entering agricultural systems globally to the total emission of nitrous oxide (N2O). We obtained an N2O emission factor (EF) of 3-5%, and applied it to biofuel production. For 'first-generation' biofuels, e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), that require N fertilizer, N2O from biofuel production could cause (depending on N uptake efficiency) as much or more global warming as that avoided by replacement of fossil fuel by the biofuel. Our subsequent calculations in a follow-up paper, using published life cycle analysis (LCA) models, led to broadly similar conclusions. The N2O EF applies to agricultural crops in general, not just to biofuel crops, and has made possible a top-down estimate of global emissions from agriculture. Independent modelling by another group using bottom-up IPCC inventory methodology has shown good agreement at the global scale with our top-down estimate. Work by Davidson showed that the rate of accumulation of N2O in the atmosphere in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries was greater than that predicted from agricultural inputs limited to fertilizer N and biologically fixed N (Davidson, E. A. 2009 Nat. Geosci. 2, 659-662.). However, by also including soil organic N mineralized following land-use change and NOx deposited from the atmosphere in our estimates of the reactive N entering the agricultural cycle, we have now obtained a good fit between the observed atmospheric N2O concentrations from 1860 to 2000 and those calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent EF for the reactive N.

TI  - Multisite statistical downscaling model for daily precipitation combined by multivariate multiple linear regression and stochastic weather generator
VL  - 114
IS  - 3
SP  - 567-591
AB  - This study provides a multi-site hybrid statistical downscaling procedure combining regression-based and stochastic weather generation approaches for multisite simulation of daily precipitation. In the hybrid model, the multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) is employed for simultaneous downscaling of deterministic series of daily precipitation occurrence and amount using large-scale reanalysis predictors over nine different observed stations in southern Qu,bec (Canada). The multivariate normal distribution, the first-order Markov chain model, and the probability distribution mapping technique are employed for reproducing temporal variability and spatial dependency on the multisite observations of precipitation series. The regression-based MMLR model explained 16 % similar to 22 % of total variance in daily precipitation occurrence series and 13 % similar to 25 % of total variance in daily precipitation amount series of the nine observation sites. Moreover, it constantly over-represented the spatial dependency of daily precipitation occurrence and amount. In generating daily precipitation, the hybrid model showed good temporal reproduction ability for number of wet days, cross-site correlation, and probabilities of consecutive wet days, and maximum 3-days precipitation total amount for all observation sites. However, the reproducing ability of the hybrid model for spatio-temporal variations can be improved, i.e. to further increase the explained variance of the observed precipitation series, as for example by using regional-scale predictors in the MMLR model. However, in all downscaling precipitation results, the hybrid model benefits from the stochastic weather generator procedure with respect to the single use of deterministic component in the MMLR model.

TI  - Comparison of Alternative Molten Electrolytes for Water Splitting to Generate Hydrogen Fuel
VL  - 163
IS  - 10
SP  - F1162-F1168
AB  - This study explores a new high temperature molten hydroxide domain to electrochemically split water into hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen fuel, if produced without greenhouse gas emissions, is a promising fuel for transportation. This study opens a pathway to low energy water splitting and the electrolytic production of hydrogen fuel without carbon dioxide emission. A wide range of pure and mixed alkali and alkali earth hydroxide electrolytes are explored at temperatures ranging from 200 to 700 degrees C. Higher temperature leads to improved (lower voltage) water splitting and improved rates of charge transfer, but carries challenges (increased rates of parasitic side reactions as the molten electrolytes dehydrate with increasing temperature). This study extends the range of hydrogen formation in alkaline electrolysis water splitting to over 600 degrees C, and demonstrates that lithium and/or barium hydroxide electrolytes remain hydrated at high temperatures, and in the high temperature domain are advantageous over sodium or potassium hydroxide electrolytes. In pure LiOH, the coulombic efficiency for hydrogen generation decreases with temperature and is measured respectively at eta(H2) = 88%, 21%, 4% and 0%, respectively at 500, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C.

TI  - The effect of land use change from grassland to bioenergy crops Miscanthus and reed canary grass on nitrous oxide emissions
VL  - 120
SP  - 396-403
AB  - Bioenergy crop production can enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, whilst producing feedstocks for energy generation. However, the GHG balance of these ecosystems is intimately linked to crop selection, previous and current land management and the effects of land conversion. This study aims to quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the early stage of land -use change (LUC) from perennial grassland to two perennial rhizomatous grasses in a temperate climate: Miscanthus and reed canary grass (RCG) in the south of Ireland. Emissions of N2O were measured during the first two years of RCG and Miscanthus establishment. Miscanthus stands emitted 7.7 +/- 1.6 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the first and the second year, respectively, while RCG produced 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the first year following LUC. Temporal fluxes of N2O were generally low, however peak emissions observed in the first year contributed approximately 83% of annual N2O in the Miscanthus treatment. This peak occurred in wet (50 mm rainfall in the week preceding the peak) and warm ( > 18.5 degrees C in the top 5 cm of soil) weather conditions and was significantly affected (R-2 = 0.77) by the soil moisture deficit. However large, annual losses from Miscanthus and RCG found in this study are well within the range of those from grassland soils in temperate climate, drawing conclusions that any short-term increases in N2O production will soon be offset by the reduced future fertilisation, carbon sequestration and produced bioenergy feedstock.

TI  - Numerical Study of Bubble Cloud and Thermal Lesion Evolution During Acoustic Droplet Vaporization Enhanced HIFU Treatment
VL  - 144
IS  - 3
AB  - Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) has been proven to enhance high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) thermal ablation of tumor. It has also been demonstrated that triggering droplets before HIFU exposure could be a potential way to control both the size and the shape of the thermal lesion. In this paper, a numerical model is proposed to predict the thermal lesion created in ADV enhanced HIFU treatment. Bubble oscillation was coupled into a viscoelastic medium in the model to more closely represent real applications in tissues. Several physical processes caused by continuous wave ultrasound and elevated temperature during the HIFU exposure were considered, including rectified diffusion, gas solubility variation with temperature in the medium, and boiling. Four droplet concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude were calculated. The bubble cloud formed from triggering of the droplets by the pulse wave ultrasound, along with the evolution of the shape and location of the bubble cloud and thermal lesion during the following continuous wave exposure was obtained. The increase of bubble void fraction caused by continuous wave exposure was found to be consistent with the experimental observation. With the increase of droplet concentration, the predicted bubble cloud shapes vary from tadpole to triangular and double triangular, while the thermal lesions move toward the transducer. The results show that the assumptions used in this model increased the accuracy of the results. This model may be used for parametrical study of ADV enhanced HIFU treatment and be further used for treatment planning and optimization in the future.

VL  - 126
IS  - 1
SP  - 122-129
AB  - Some of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) broodstock reproductive constraints are related to sperm quality. Although they present two defined spawning season (spring and autumn), males gave semen during all the year thus an exhaustive annual sperm analysis is important to determine the seasonal changes in semen quality. Sampling was performed monthly during one year, analyzing different cellular parameters to better understand sperm quality limitations obstructing sole mass production. The percentage of progressive motile cells and their linear velocity showed a decrease from March (beginning of the first spawning season) to July (when the highest temperatures were observed), followed by a slight increase in August and October (second spawning season). DNA fragmentation values showed highest values between the two spawning seasons and decreased to the end of the year. The percentage of apoptotic cells was lowest in March (beginning of the first spawning season) and the highest in November. The percentage of cells resistant to seawater exposure presented two peaks related with both spawning seasons. There was a tendency for the semen to attain a quality peak between the beginning and the middle of the first spawning season (March-May), followed by a pronounced decrease, achieving the lowest values during the months with the highest temperature. Also, the different males present in the broodstocks reach their sperm quality peak at different times, which will result in an unequal contribution for the next generation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Overview of p-on-n planar IRFPAs at DEFIR
VL  - 8533
AB  - In this paper, we report on results obtained both at CEA/LETI and SOFRADIR on p-on-n Infra-Red Focal Plane Arrays (IR FPAs) from the Short-Wave (SW) to the Very-Long-Wave (VLW) spectral range. For many years, p-on-n arsenic-ion implanted planar technology has been developed and improved within the framework of the joint laboratory DEFIR, a collaborative effort bringing together the expertise of both teams. Compared to n-on-p architecture, p-on-n technology allows to lower dark current density and series resistance by means of respectively long-lifetime minority carriers (hole) and high-mobility majority carriers (electrons). As a consequence, p-on-n photodiodes are well-adapted for very large FPAs operating either at high temperature or very low flux. The Mid-Wave (MW) and Long-Wave (LW) spectral ranges have been firstly addressed with TV/4 FPAs, 30 mu m pitch, principally for defence and security applications. Our results showed state-of-the-art detector performances, consistent with "Rule 07" model, a relevant indicator of the p-on-n technology maturity. The subsequent developments of p-on-n imagers have produced more compact, less energy consuming systems, with a substantial resolution enhancement. In this way, MW and LW FPAs, TV format, with 15 mu m pixel pitch have been designed. First results obtained in MW (lambda c=5.3 mu m @80 K) for High Operating Temperature (HOT) applications have showed highly promising Electro-Optical (EO) performances. Space applications are another exciting but challenging domains where p-on-n is a good candidate. In this way, imagers dedicated to low-flux detection have first been realized as TV/4 FPAs, with 15 mu m pitch in the SW spectral range (2 mu m). The dark currents obtained are coherent with those published in the literature. Finally, TV/4 arrays, 30 mu m pixel pitch, have been manufactured for the very long wave spectral range. For this detection range, the quality of material and reliability of technology are the most critical. The measured dark current fits "Rule 07" well, with homogeneous imagers. In conclusion, DEFIR team have developed, improved and characterized p-on-n IR FPAs from SW to VLW spectral range. In all spectral ranges, we have demonstrated state-of-the-art results, which highlight the quality of material and viability of our p-on-n technology. This technology, currently industrialized by SOFRADIR, opens new ways for next generation of imagers.

TI  - Measures to reduce plastic deformation on static pressure plates of multi-disc brakes as a result of high frictional power applied on one side
AB  - The thermally caused plastic deformation on static pressure plates of multi-disc brakes can permanently disturb their operating behavior and should therefore, be avoided. The plastic deformation of the pressure plate can, for example, lead to a reduction of the air gap and cause unwanted changes in the friction conditions. During the braking process, highly heated areas close to the friction surface expand whilst they are prevented from expanding by surrounding zones of lower temperature. If the resulting stresses exceed the yield point of the material, plastic deformation occurs. This article explains the physical deformation process in detail and, based on this, what measures can be taken to reduce the deformation. Hence, three approaches are first identified based on theoretical preliminary considerations. These approaches affect both the geometry and the materials of the pressure plates. Radial slits are designed to prevent the obstruction of thermal expansion and thereby reduce stresses; material selection based on thermal shock sensitivity reduces plastic deformation. Using a combined simulation of the thermal and mechanical behavior of a pressure plate, the effect of the measures is examined on four variants of the pressure plate. Experimental investigations on real prototypes of the pressure plate variants confirm the results of the simulation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the examined measures to reduce plastic deformation.

TI  - Future production and utilisation of biomass in Sweden: Potentials and CO2 mitigation
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
SP  - 399-412
AB  - Swedish biomass production potential could be increased significantly if new production methods, such as optimised fertilisation, were to be used. Optimised fertilisation on 25% of Swedish forest and and the use of stem wood could almost double the biomass potential from forestry compared with no fertilisation, as both logging residues and large quantities of excess stem wood not needed for industrial purposes could be used for energy purposes. Together with energy crops and straw from agriculture, the total Swedish biomass potential would be about 230 TWh/yr or half the current Swedish energy supply if the demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes were the same as today. The new production methods are assumed not to cause any significant negative impact on the local environment. The cost of utilising stem wood produced with optimised fertilisation for energy purposes has not been analysed and needs further investigation. Besides replacing fossil fuels and, thus, reducing current Swedish CO2 emissions by about 65%, this amount of biomass is enough to produce electricity equivalent to 20% of current power production. Biomass-based electricity is produced preferably through co-generation using district heating systems in densely populated regional and pulp industries in forest regions. Alcohols for transportation and stand-alone power production are preferably produced in less densely populated regions with excess biomass. A high intensity in biomass production would reduce biomass transportation demands. There are uncertainties regarding the future demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes, the amount of arable land available for energy crop production and future yields. These factors will influence Swedish biomass potential and earlier estimates of the potential vary from 15 to 125 TWh/yr. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Bio-Templating: An Emerging Synthetic Technique for Catalysts. A Review
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - In the last few years, researchers have focused their attention on the synthesis of new catalyst structures based on or inspired by nature. Biotemplating involves the transfer of biological structures to inorganic materials through artificial mineralization processes. This approach offers the main advantage of allowing morphological control of the product, as a template with the desired morphology can be pre-determined, as long as it is found in nature. This way, natural evolution through millions of years can provide us with new synthetic pathways to develop some novel functional materials with advantageous properties, such as sophistication, miniaturization, hybridization, hierarchical organization, resistance, and adaptability to the required need. The field of application of these materials is very wide, covering nanomedicine, energy capture and storage, sensors, biocompatible materials, adsorbents, and catalysis. In the latter case, bio-inspired materials can be applied as catalysts requiring different types of active sites (i.e., redox, acidic, basic sites, or a combination of them) to a wide range of processes, including conventional thermal catalysis, photocatalysis, or electrocatalysis, among others. This review aims to cover current experimental studies in the field of biotemplating materials synthesis and their characterization, focusing on their application in heterogeneous catalysis.

TI  - Modelling habitat choice in fish using adapted random walk
VL  - 86
IS  - 6
SP  - 477-483
AB  - A new concept for modelling habitat choice, called an adapted random walk, is presented. The concept is based on the evolution of threshold values for departures and destinations using a genetic algorithm. A habitat is departed if the fitness value associated with it is below the evolved threshold value. Movement is determined probabilistically using random numbers and adapted threshold values. Different versions of this concept were tested for the ability to model horizontal distribution of the Barents Sea capelin using two different fitness criteria. When adapting both departure and destination thresholds, the model performed better than a neural network model with the same number of adapted variables. The evolved threshold values can be used interchangeably with values estimated in the field, for example preferred temperature ranges or prey abundance. The adapted random walk concept functions intuitively, and can be useful for applied Purposes, such as extending models of fish distribution beyond the advected stages and studying the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of fish.

TI  - Assessing energy storage technology options using a multi-criteria decision analysis-based framework
VL  - 231
SP  - 788-802
AB  - With the growing adoption of intermittent renewable energy generation the role for energy storage to provide a number of service needs is being increasingly recognised. However, 'energy storage' encompasses a family of technologies, each with its own set of performance, cost and physical characteristics, at different stages of development. At the same time, each energy system however defined has specific needs; and energy systems are themselves part of a wider socio-technical system which has aims beyond the confines of the energy 'tri-lemma'. As energy storage technologies develop, funding is becoming available to demonstrate their application in realistic environments. However, with multiple technical and non-technical factors to consider, it is challenging for many decision makers who often have limited expertise and resources to select which projects to support. In this paper we first describe a novel framework for assessing the wider benefits that could come from deploying energy storage using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), a form of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. We then use the framework to assess six potential energy storage projects through a combination of technical analysis and stakeholder input in the county of Cornwall in the UK: a region that has good solar and wind resource with relatively low demand and constrained network infrastructure. The projects assessed were: power to gas, a distributed battery system, battery storage integrated with solar PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay, liquid air energy storage, battery storage integrated with wave energy, and thermal energy storage at a new residential development. We conclude that MAVT can provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach, which can be easily used by decision makers for assessing energy storage projects across a range of criteria and promoting engagement with stakeholders. This approach also allows the subjectivity of decision-making, a potential limitation, to be explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of MAVT can lead to important insights for the development of energy systems, which in this study included the importance of local priorities to decision-making. In this case, battery storage with PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay was the top-ranking project, performing well across a range of attributes including the maturity of the technology, its ability to defer grid upgrades and economic viability.

TI  - Historical and Current Hatchery Programs and Management of Chum Salmon in Hokkaido, Northern Japan
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SP  - 469-479
AB  - The hatchery program for chum salmon in Hokkaido, northern Japan, constitutes one of the largest salmon hatchery programs in the world. The hatchery program has been conducted for over 120years, and returns of chum salmon rapidly increased during the last quarter of the 20th century. Since the 1990s, chum salmon returns to Hokkaido have remained at a historically high level, although different fluctuation trends have been observed among regions within Hokkaido. Although such intensive hatchery programs have been conducted for more than 25 generations, there has been no evidence indicating any decline of genetic diversity. The hatchery program for chum salmon in Hokkaido is successful in increasing commercial catches and will likely be the main management tool in future. However, information on naturally spawning chum salmon in Hokkaido remains scarce. Assessment of naturally spawning populations recently commenced, and it has been revealed that naturally spawning chum salmon populations remain in many rivers in Hokkaido. For future management, monitoring chum salmon of both hatchery and natural origin is important, and a novel strategy that accounts for the enhancement of commercial stocks and the coexistence of hatchery programs and wild populations should be established in Japan.

TI  - Testing MOND gravity in the shell galaxy NGC 3923
VL  - 559
AB  - Context. The elliptical galaxy NGC3923 is surrounded by numerous stellar shells that are concentric arcs centered on the Galactic core. They are very likely a result of a minor merger and they consist of stars in nearly radial orbits. For a given potential, the shell radii at a given time after the merger can be calculated and compared to observations. The MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a theory that aims to solve the missing mass problem by modifying the laws of classical dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. Hernquist & Quinn (1987b, ApJ, 312, 1) claimed that the shell distribution of NGC3923 contradicted MOND, but Milgrom (1988, ApJ, 332, 86) found several substantial insufficiencies in their work. Aims. We test whether the observed shell distribution in NGC3923 is consistent with MOND using the current observational knowledge of the shell number and positions and of the host galaxy surface brightness profile, which supersede the data available in the 1980s when the last (and negative) tests of MOND viability were performed on NGC3923. Methods. Using the 3.6 mu m bandpass image of NGC3923 from the Spitzer space telescope we construct the mass profile of the galaxy. The evolution of shell radii in MOND is then computed using analytical formulae. We use 27 currently observed shells and allow for their multi-generation formation, unlike the Hernquist & Quinn one-generation model that used the 18 shells known at the time. Results. Our model reproduces the observed shell radii with a maximum deviation of similar to 5% for 25 out of 27 known shells while keeping a reasonable formation scenario. A multi-generation nature of the shell system, resulting from successive passages of the surviving core of the tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy, is one of key ingredients of our scenario supported by the extreme shell radial range. The 25 reproduced shells are interpreted as belonging to three generations.

VL  - 3

SP  - 70-76
AB  - This paper presents a case study of a locally adapted sustainable strategy of salinity reduction applied to the Saint Lawrence maritime ecosystem at the Biodome de Montreal. In conformity with the standards of the CAZA (Canadian Aquarium and Zoos Association), this procedure was implemented to reconcile animal well-being, ecosystem representativeness and control of costs under the operational environment of a cold seawater recirculation system featuring the Golfe du Saint Laurent Ecosystem (GSLE) and its associated live collection. A simple methodology to carry out safe salinity reduction procedures of artificial seawater environments (from 28 to 24 Practical Salinity Units) is proposed and detailed. Adapted salinity challenge tests at 14, 21 and 24 were conducted beforehand and simple adapted indicators were used on a selection of key species (thorny skate: Raja radiate; little skate: R. erinacea; barndoor skate: R. laevis; Atlantic cod: Gadus morhua; green urchins: Strongylocentrolus droebachien and American lobster: Homarus americanus) to evaluate the well-being and mortality risks associated with both a lower operational salinity (long-term exposure) and an unavoidable salinity drop (short-term exposure) observed during routine large-scale water renewal operations. Economic gains achieved through reduction in the use of costly synthetic salt formulation were calculated. The savings achieved during three years of operation at 24 PSU have been applied to the improvement of the water quality control management capacities of the GLSE exhibit such as a sulphur-based denitrification unit, additional ozonation and protein skimming capacities.

TI  - The ubiquitous presence of silica-rich glass inclusions in mafic minerals: Examples from Earth, Mars, Moon and the aubrite parent body
VL  - 33
IS  - 5
SP  - 1041-1051
AB  - Highly silicic glass inclusions are commonly present in mafic minerals of xenolithic terrestrial upper mantle rocks (Schiano and Clocchiatti, 1994). They are believed to be the products of volatile-rich silicic melts for which several sources have been proposed (Francis, 1976; Frey and Green, 1974; Schiano et al., 1995), but their origin(s) and, consequently, that of the glasses, remains unknown. However, in situ formation by very low-degree partial melting seems to be possible as has been shown by experiments (e.g., Baker et al., 1995; Draper and Green, 1997). Glass inclusions of silicic chemical composition are also present in some mafic minerals of achondritic meteorites (e.g., Fuchs, 1974; Okada et al., 1988; Johnson et al., 1991). The enstatite achondrites (aubrites) Aubres and Norton County, which record early planetesimal and planet formation in the solar nebula, and the olivine achondrite (chassignite) Chassigny, a rock believed to originate from Mars, contain abundant glass inclusions in their main minerals enstatite and olivine, respectively. Glasses of glass-bearing inclusions have a highly silicic and volatile-rich chemical composition similar, but not identical, to that of glass inclusions in terrestrial upper mantle peridotite minerals. Furthermore, glass inclusions in olivines from the Moon (e.g., Roedder and Weiblen, 1977) are also silica-rich. Because different physicochemical conditions prevail in the source regions of these rocks, the process of melting is, perhaps, not generally applicable for the generation of silica-rich glasses. Alternatively, the glasses could have been formed via precipitation from silicate-loaded fluids (Schneider and Eggler, 1986) or vapors. Another possible mechanism, not previously identified, could be dehydrogenation of nominally nonhydrous mafic minerals by heating or depressurization that should be accompanied by expulsion of excess silica and incompatible elements. This process will mimic low-temperature, very low-degree partial melting. It could account also for the highly variable glass/bubble ratios observed in glass inclusions in aubrite enstatites. We suggest that such a process could have been operating in the solar nebula, the Moon and Mars, and could be operating still on Earth.

TI  - Ice-fishing handling practices and their effects on the short-term post-release behaviour of Largemouth bass
VL  - 243
AB  - Numerous studies have investigated the impacts of catch-and-release on the post-release behaviour of fish during periods characterized by warm air and water temperatures. Comparatively little is known about the post-release behaviour of fish caught while ice fishing. Largemouth bass (LMB), a popular sportfish in North America, is sometimes encountered during ice fishing and is often released due to angler conservation ethic or to comply with regulations. To examine the impacts of ice angling on the post-release behaviour of LMB, we exposed them to a range of handling practices and assessed their skin temperatures prior to release, as well as short-term postrelease swimming activity using biologgers equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer, temperature and pressure sensors. Skin temperature of LMB had a significant positive relationship with windchill temperature. Generally, the longer that LMB were exposed to air or placed on the ice, the colder their skin became. Overall, water depth and water temperature selected by LMB increased with time during the post-release period. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), a proxy for locomotory activity, decreased as time progressed in the release period, while ODBA decreased with increasing depth and water temperatures. LMB with warmer skin temperatures had lower locomotory activity compared to those with colder skin temperatures. Further, the effect of skin temperature on locomotory activity became more amplified with increasing depth and warming water temperatures selected by LMB post-release. Anglers practicing catch-and-release angling during the winter should adopt best handling practices by reducing the time fish are removed from the water when windchill temperatures are subfreezing to avoid alteration in post-release behaviour.

AB  - Purpose of review To summarize key studies in liver preservation published over the last 3 years and evaluate benefits and limitations of the different perfusion techniques. Selected experimental applications that may be translated to the clinical use will be also discussed. Recent findings Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has transitioned into clinical practice. Viability assessment is a reliable tool for clinical decision-making, and safety of the back-to-base approach has facilitated adoption of the technology. Data supporting well tolerated use of declined livers after NMP and new protocols selecting complex recipients aim to improve access to suitable organs. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is showing promising clinical results by decreasing biliary complications in recipients' receiving organs donated after circulatory death (DCD) and improving early graft function in extended criteria organs. Long-term data of HMP on DCD livers shows improved graft survival over standard SCS. Novel approaches utilizing sequential HMP--NMP or ischaemia-free preservation aim to improve outcomes of extended criteria organs. Machine perfusion for organ transplantation has become an established technique but the field is rapidly evolving. Ongoing research focuses on evaluation of the intervention efficacy and finding optimal indications to use each perfusion strategy according to graft type and clinical scenario.

TI  - Low water content in the mantle source of the Hainan plume as a factor inhibiting the formation of a large igneous province
VL  - 515
SP  - 221-230
AB  - Large igneous provinces (LIPS) are generally considered to be related to mantle plumes and to have a great importance to the supercontinent break-up events, climate change and biological evolution over Earth's history. The high melt production rates of LIPs can be achieved under rigorous melting conditions: an abnormally high temperature, substantial decompression, addition of fusible components, or remarkable enrichment in water. Although it has been repeatedly noticed that water enrichment has occurred in many Phanerozoic LIPs, the significance of water enrichment in the mantle source for the generation of LIPs has not been explicitly highlighted. The southeastern Asian basalt province (SABP), which is thought to have formed by the Hainan mantle plume from a pyroxenite-bearing source, was emplaced over a small area of about 0.037 Mkm(2) over a long period of time from 28.5 Ma to Holocene, thus differing from a typical LIP (>0.1 Mkm(3) in volume emplaced in one or multiple pulses of less than 5 Ma). In this work, we measured H2O contents of high-Mg# clinopyroxene phenocrysts (12-179 ppm H2O) from Cenozoic basalts in the northern Hainan Island, which is part of the SABP. These data were utilized to estimate the water content of the mantle source of these basalts, yielding values in the range of 84-360 ppm H2O, which are significantly lower than those obtained for many Phanerozoic LIPs (thousands of ppm). After calculating the mantle potential temperature for the Hainan basalts about 170 degrees C higher than that for the MORB source mantle, we consider that the paucity of source water likely depressed the melt productivity and the velocity of plume upwelling, and induced the Hainan plume to stall at depths of 350-500 km, inhibiting the formation of a LIP by the Hainan plume, despite the occurrence of other favorable conditions. Hence, our results from the SABP provide evidence for the significance of water enrichment in the mantle source in the formation of LIPs. The low water content in the Hainan plume can be attributed to the incorporation of subducted slabs that had experienced significant dehydration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential of woody biomass production for motivating widespread natural resource management under climate change
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 713-725
AB  - In this study we assessed the potential of woody biomass (short-rotation Mallee Eucalypts) for renewable energy generation as an economically viable way of motivating widespread natural resource management under climate change in the 11.9 million ha Lower Murray agricultural region in southern Australia. The spatial distribution of productivity of agricultural crops and pasture, and biomass was modelled. Average annual economic returns were calculated under historical mean (baseline) climate and three climate change scenarios. Economically viable areas of biomass production were identified where the profitability of biomass is greater than the profitability of agriculture under each scenario for three factory gate biomass prices. The benefits of biomass production for dryland salinisation, wind erosion, and carbon emissions reduction through biomass-based renewable energy production were also modelled. Depending on climate scenario, at the median price assessed ($40/tonne) biomass production can generate $51.4-$88M in annual net economic returns, address 41,226-165,577 ha at high risk of dryland salinisation and 228,000-1.4 million ha at high risk of wind erosion, and mitigate 10.4-12 million tonnes of carbon (CO2-e) emissions annually. Economically viable areas for biomass production expanded under climatic warming and drying especially in more marginal agricultural land. Under the baseline, the area at high risk of dryland salinisation was more than double that at high risk of wind erosion. However, under climatic warming and drying the relative importance of these two natural resource management objectives switched with the area at high risk of wind erosion becoming much larger. As biomass production can achieve multiple natural resource management objectives, it may provide a land use policy option that is adaptable to changing priorities and economically resilient given climatic uncertainties. For such a significant and enduring land use change policy it is prudent to assess both the economic and environmental potential under climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selective coatings for new concepts of parabolic trough collectors
VL  - 49
SP  - 30-39
AB  - The CSP technology based on parabolic trough solar collector for large electricity generation purposes is currently the most mature of all CSP designs in terms of previous operation experience and scientific and technical research and development. The current parabolic trough design deals with a maximum operating temperature around 400 degrees C in the absorber collector tube but some recent designs are planned to increase the working temperature to 600 degrees C increasing the performance by 5-10% to attain the improved productivity that the market demands. These systems are expected to be working during 20-25 years. One of the key points of the receiver is the stack of layers forming the selective absorber coating. Typical optical values for this coating are >95% of absorbance and 10% of emittance at 400 degrees C. In the HITECO EU funded project a new modular concept of collector is being tested. With this new design the coating has to fulfill new requirements as the collector will be working at 600 degrees C and in a low vacuum of 10(-2) mbar. The authors from IK4-Tekniker have collaborated in the HITECO project building a sputtering system to upscale these new coatings to 4 meters long tubes for the application in a set of experimental collectors, being the project coordination done by ARIES Ingenieria y sistemas S.A. However, there is a great lack of knowledge about the performance of the absorber coatings during the whole life of the receiver. So, it is necessary to establish characterization methods and standards to guarantee the performance, durability and quality control of high temperature coatings. For this purpose, a new EU funded project called NECSO, aims to design accelerated ageing protocols to test the evolution of these coatings under more aggressive conditions in the new designs.

Gloger's rule posits that animals should be dark- vs. light-colored in warm and humid vs. cold and dry habitats, respectively. The rule is based on the assumption that melanin pigments and/or dark coloration confer selective advantages in warm and humid regions. This rule may not apply, however, if genes for color are acting on other traits conferring fitness benefits in specific climes. Covariation between coloration and climate will therefore depend on the relative importance of coloration or melanin pigments and the genetically correlated physiological and behavioral processes that enable an animal to deal with climatic factors. The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) displays three melanin-based plumage traits, and we tested whether geographic variation in these traits at the scale of the North American continent supported Gloger's rule. An analysis of variation of pheomelanin-based reddish coloration and of the number and size of black feather spots in 1,369 museum skin specimens showed that geographic variation was correlated with ambient temperature and precipitation. Owls were darker red in color and displayed larger but fewer black feather spots in colder regions. Owls also exhibited more and larger black spots in regions where the climate was dry in winter. We propose that the associations between pigmentation and ambient temperature are of opposite sign for reddish coloration and spot size vs. the number of spots because selection exerted by climate (or a correlated variable) is plumage trait-specific or because plumage traits are genetically correlated with different adaptations.

AB  - The use of enzymes in industrial catalysis continues to grow because of the considerable advantages of natural catalytic systems. The need for enantiomerically pure fine chemicals and the movement away from chemically burdened technologies will drive the acceptance of enzyme-assisted processes. New technologies for enzyme discovery and optimization have enabled the application of enzymes in harsh industrial conditions and in processes demanding stringent selectivity. These discovery and laboratory evolution methods entail genomic approaches that by their nature engender screening of extremely large numbers of gene types and variants. By extension, the fitness of an individual high-throughput screen requires an intelligent, process-targeted assay amenable to a chosen screening platform.

TI  - Reducing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) emissions from a real-scale iron ore sinter plant by adjusting its sinter raw mix
VL  - 112
SP  - 1184-1189
AB  - This study was conducted in a real-scale iron ore sinter plant for reducing emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from the iron ore sintering process via the adjustment of its sinter raw mix. Based on operating condition of the selected plant, four experimental campaigns of C-ref (currently used raw mix, served as the reference), C-H (modified from C-ref, with a 15% increase in hematite but 15% decrease in limonite), C-H,C-EP (modified from C-H, without electrostatic precipitator (EP) and blast furnace (BF) flue dusts), and C-H,C-EP,C-W (modified from C-H,C-EP, with a 0.5 wt% increase in water content) were chosen. For each experimental campaign, three replicate samples of PCDD/Fs were collected from the flue gases, and the sinter productivity and sinter strength were measured simultaneously. In comparison with C-ref, the most significant reductions in PCDD/F and I-TEQ emissions was found in C-H,C-EP (=68% and 76%, respectively), and the main reduction was found in PCDFs (54-76% decrease). C-H could reduce emissions of PCDD/Fs and I-TEQ by 47% and 51%, respectively. But the addition of water contents (i.e., C-H,C-EP,C-W) did not result in further reductions. Since sinter productivity and sinter strength of all experimental campaigns were quite similar, C-H,C-EP could be a promising raw mix for reducing PCDD/F emissions from the sintering process.

TI  - A pilot study for determining the optimal operation condition for simultaneously controlling the emissions of PCDD/Fs and PAHs from the iron ore sintering process
VL  - 88
IS  - 11
SP  - 1324-1331
AB  - In this study, the cost-benefit analysis technique was developed and incorporated into the Taguchi experimental design to determine the optimal operation combination for the purpose of providing a technique solution for controlling both emissions of PCDD/Fs and PAHs, and increasing both the sinter productivity (SP) and sinter strength (SS) simultaneously. Four operating parameters, including the water content, suction pressure, bed height, and type of hearth layer, were selected and all experimental campaigns were conducted on a pilot-scale sinter pot to simulate various sintering operating conditions of a real-scale sinter plant. The resultant optimal combination could reduce the total carcinogenic emissions arising from both emissions of PCDD/Fs and PAHs by 49.8%, and increase the sinter benefit associated with the increase in both SP and SS by 10.1%, as in comparison with the operation condition currently used in the real plant. The ANOVA results indicate that the suction pressure was the most dominant parameter in determining the optimal operation combination. The above result was theoretically plausible since the higher suction pressure provided more oxygen contents leading to the decrease in both PCDD/F and PAH emissions. But it should be noted that the results obtained from the present study were based on pilot scale experiments, conducting confirmation tests in a real scale plant are still necessary in the future.

TI  - Copper welding applications with a 2 kW cw laser in the green wavelength regime
VL  - 11273
AB  - We report on industrial high-power lasers in the green wavelength regime. By means of a thin disk oscillator and a resonator-internal nonlinear crystal for second harmonic generation we provide 2000 W continuous-wave laser radiation at a wavelength of 515 nm, transported by a fiber with a 150 mu m core diameter and NA 0.1. Application tests show that this laser is perfectly suited for copper welding due to the superior absorption of the green wavelength compared to IR, which allows the production of spatter-free weld spots and seams with an unprecedented reproducibility in diameter and welding depth. Now with 2 kW available power in the green, the welding performance for high quality welds can be increased compared to the already available 1 kW green laser system. The higher power leads to a larger melt volume and higher process efficiency. It is also possible to weld other materials with high quality results, for example stainless steel or aluminum. A particular advantage compared to the common IR lasers is the ability of the green laser for heat conduction mode because of the higher absorption. But due to the high beam quality also high-quality deep penetration welding is applicable, with the comfort to use scanner optics with a big field of work. This offers a whole range of new applications, e.g. remote-deburring of copper parts or producing a shiny copper surface by using shielding gas in addition. A further significant benefit of the green wavelength is that the surface condition does not influence the welding process, which allows to skip many expensive preprocessing steps such as tin-coating. Especially for e-mobility tasks the green 2 kW laser source is a suitable option for increasing productivity and quality: One example are copper foil stacks for battery production, which can be welded with higher speed and reduced spatter formation without ultrasonic pre-welding.

TI  - High temperatures constrain microhabitat selection and activity patterns of the insular Cape Verde wall gecko
VL  - 81
SP  - 18-25
AB  - The diel activity, microhabitat selection and thermobiology were investigated in Tarentola substituta, a gecko endemic to an arid Cape Verde island, S. Vicente. Standardized transects were performed recording the microhabitat availability and the body, soil, refuge, air temperatures, relative humidity, gecko category (juvenile, adult male or female) and activity status for each observation. Thermal conditions were monitored with data-loggers. The activity pattern of the species was strictly nocturnal, as desert geckos. All individuals selected rocks as diurnal refuges, but adults used more medium-sized rocks (scarce) and juveniles small rocks (abundant). Such selection was mostly attributable to the refuges thermal properties: small rocks attained higher temperatures due to their lower thermal inertia. Geckos behaved as tigmotherms when active by night and as thermoconformers with the substrate by day. Nocturnal body temperatures did not differ among gecko categories or microhabitats. However, since juveniles selected small rocks, their diurnal body temperatures became higher, sometimes possibly risking overheating. Territoriality, scarcity of optimal refuges, high conspecific densities and lack of ground-predators may explain why juveniles use thermally suboptimal microhabitats. Results suggest that ecological shifts (nocturnality, microhabitat selection) and lack of competitors allowed T substituta to adapt to the archipelago's demanding arid and hot conditions.

TI  - Survival of time-evolved quantum correlations depending on whether quenching is across a critical point in an XY spin chain
VL  - 93
IS  - 4
AB  - The time dynamics of quantum correlations in the quantum transverse anisotropic XY spin chain of infinite length is studied at zero and finite temperatures. The evolution occurs due to the instantaneous quenching of the coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is performed either within the same phase or across the quantum phase-transition point connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the time-evolved quantum correlations, viz., entanglement and quantum discord, which exhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching scheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced nearest-neighbor bipartite quantum correlations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from the ordered to the deep disordered phase. However, nearest-neighbor quantum correlations are almostwashed out when the system is quenched from the disordered to the ordered phase with the initial state being at the zero temperature. We also identify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations when the system is quenched within the same phase. Moreover, we investigate the bipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature, which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation on the phenomena observed at zero temperature. Finally, an analogous analysis is carried out for zero-temperature next-nearest-neighbor quantum correlations.

AB  - Soil associated stages, pupae, and last-instar larvae of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (PBW), were evaluated for susceptibility to the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Mexican strain, Kapow selection). Mean mortality responses of PBW larvae entering the soil naturally compared to larvae buried artificially (2.5 cm deep) are 99.5 and 73.4%, respectively, at 15 infective juveniles/larva. The time required for nematode infection of larvae (38.0/cm2 soil surface) was 24 h or less. Larval mortality was significantly reduced at 15.6-degrees-C compared with 21.1, 26.7, and 32.2-degrees-C. Live nematodes were found in PBW larvae at all temperatures tested except 32.2-degrees-C. Reproduction of juveniles was evident 3 days after exposure at 26.7-degrees-C. At 26.7-degrees-C, mortality of nondiapause larvae was not significantly different than diapause larvae. Pupae were not susceptible unless injured. Entomopathogenic nematodes have potential as a biological control agent for PBW when larvae enter the soil.

TI  - Modeling the impact of climate change on a rare color morph in fish
VL  - 387
SP  - 10-16
AB  - Species are typically comprised of a large number of genotypes, some of which are rare. Rare genotypes that are temperature-sensitive will predictably be impacted by climate change more profoundly than common genotypes for which gene expression does not depend on temperature. Computer simulations were used in this study to analyze the impact of changing temperatures on a very rare melanic morph that expresses a temperature-sensitive phenotype and is found in an abundant fish species (Gambusia holbrooki). This numerical model assesses the frequency of the two natural color morphs, silver and black-spotted, over time and iterates in each generation, incorporating survival estimates for different life stages based upon data collected during empirical experiments. Using the current projections for mean surface temperature increase, which are 2.5 degrees F to 10.4 degrees F by the year 2100, the impact of warming environment on the mosquitofish population was analyzed. Three different climate warming scenarios were used to address annual temperature fluctuations and incorporate predicted temperature rise at correspondingly minimal, mid, and maximum levels. Our results indicate that increasing temperatures will seriously affect the rare color morph and in some cases will result in extinction. The minimal climate-warming scenario produced lower extinction risks for the rare morph; however, it still decreased the frequency of the rare genotype to minimal values. The mid-range warming scenario produced a higher risk of extinction, while the maximum warming scenario resulted in the extinction of the rare color morph. The results of this study shed light on the possibility that the effects of climate change may have important ramifications for rare genotypes in nature and will likely drive some rare species genotypes to extinction.

TI  - Behavioural fever in zebrafish larvae
VL  - 67
SP  - 287-292
AB  - Behavioural fever has been reported in different species of mobile ectotherms including the zebrafish, Danio redo, in response to exogenous pyrogens. In this study we report, to our knowledge for the first time, upon the ontogenic onset of behavioural fever in zebrafish (Danio redo) larvae. For this, zebrafish larvae (from first feeding to juveniles) were placed in a continuous thermal gradient providing the opportunity to select their preferred temperature. The novel thermal preference aquarium was based upon a continuous vertical column system and allows for non-invasive observation of larvae vertical distribution under isothermal (T-R at 28 degrees C) and thermal gradient conditions (T-CH: 28-32 degrees C). Larval thermal preference was assessed under both conditions with or without an immersion challenge, in order to detect the onset of the behavioural fever response. Our results defined the onset of the dsRNA induced behavioural fever at 18-20 days post fertilization (dpf). Significant differences were observed in dsRNA challenged larvae, which prefer higher temperatures (1-4 degrees C increase) throughout the experimental period as compared to non-challenged larvae. In parallel we measured the abundance of antiviral transcripts; viperin, gig2, irf7, trim25 and Mxb mRNAs in dsRNA challenged larvae under both thermal regimes: T-R and T-Ch. Significant increases in the abundance of all measured transcripts were recorded under thermal choice conditions signifying that thereto-coupling and the resultant enhancement of the immune response to dsRNA challenge occurs from 18 dpf onwards in the zebrafish. The results are of importance as they identify a key developmental stage where the neuro-immune interface matures in the zebrafish likely providing increased resistance to viral infection.

TI  - THERMAL ECOLOGY OF A MALARIAL PARASITE AND ITS INSECT VECTOR - CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PARASITES TRANSMISSION SUCCESS
VL  - 64
IS  - 5
SP  - 553-562
AB  - 1. We examined the transmission biology of Plasmodium mexicanum, a parasite of the fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis, and its vector, the sandfly Lutzomyia vexator. Female L. vexator produced a dutch of eggs after each blood meal taken from a lizard. Mortality was high after oviposition, so few sandflies were likely to take two blood meals and almost none took three. Therefore, to maximize its transmission success, the parasite must complete development in its insect host before the vector lays its eggs and takes another blood meal. 2. Between 16 degrees C and 32 degrees C, temperature did not affect the longevity of female sandflies, but did affect the rate of parasite development in the insect, the rate of maturation of sandflies' eggs, and the probability of sandflies becoming infected. 3. The above relationships with temperature were non-linear and differed in shape among the variables such that an increase in temperature between 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C benefited the parasite by shortening its development while not reducing the time until the sandfly's next blood meal. 4. We measured the temperatures available to the vectors in nature (burrows of ground squirrels). Within this range, there was a window that allowed successful transmission of the parasite (based on laboratory studies). 5. In a thermal gradient, unfed female sandflies selected mean temperatures approximately 4 degrees C below the minimum required for transmission. After a blood meal from a non-infected lizard, the insect's mean preferred temperature increased 1.6 degrees C, presumably to aid digestion, and ifa blood meal was taken from an infected lizard mean preferred body temperature increased by 3.6 degrees C. 6. Compared with 10 other Plasmodium species, P. mexicanum has a very rapid rate of development in its vector. 7. The results suggest P. mexicanum enhances its transmission success through a combination of rapid development in the insect host and manipulation of the vector's thermoregulatory behaviour.

TI  - Effective specialist or jack of all trades? Experimental evolution of a crop pest in fluctuating and stable environments
AB  - Understanding pest evolution in agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective and innovative pest control strategies. Types of cultivation, such as crop mono-cultures versus polycultures or crop rotation, may act as a selective pressure on pests' capability to exploit the host's resources. In this study, we examined the herbivorous mite Aceria tosichella (commonly known as wheat curl mite), a widespread wheat pest, to understand how fluctuating versus stable environments influence its niche breadth and ability to utilize different host plant species. We subjected a wheat-bred mite population to replicated experimental evolution in a single-host environment (either wheat or barley), or in an alternation between these two plant species every three mite generations. Next, we tested the fitness of these evolving populations on wheat, barley, and on two other plant species not encountered during experimental evolution, namely rye and smooth brome. Our results revealed that the niche breadth of A. tosichella evolved in response to the level of environmental variability. The fluctuating environment expanded the niche breadth by increasing the mite's ability to utilize different plant species, including novel ones. Such an environment may thus promote flexible host-use generalist phenotypes. However, the niche expansion resulted in some costs expressed as reduced performances on both wheat and barley as compared to specialists. Stable host environments led to specialized phenotypes. The population that evolved in a constant environment consisting of barley increased its fitness on barley without the cost of utilizing wheat. However, the population evolving on wheat did not significantly increase its fitness on wheat, but decreased its performance on barley. Altogether, our results indicated that, depending on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, agricultural systems create different conditions that influence pests' niche breadth evolution, which may in turn affect the ability of pests to persist in such systems.

VL  - 16

SP  - 258-282
AB  - Stress in psychology and biology is defined as any pressure that elicits a response from an organism. Whether cells encounter stresses; the response can be very different from their environment, duration and type of stresses as well as kind of cell. Living organisms can respond to stresses by various mechanisms. There are often interactions between disparate responses that finally determine the destiny of the cell under stress from activating survival paths to starting damaged cell elimination progress. The most crucial roles in responding to stress are played by Signal Transduction Systems. Three domains of lives respond to different stresses and/or stressors include; DNA damage, the unfolded protein, mitochondria' signaling stress, proliferation or elimination of damaged cells responses. In general, there are levels for defending against stressors (1) plasma membrane and cell wall, (2) cytosolic and molecular adaptability such as salt-in, salt-out and Compatible solutes strategies and (3) finally gene regulation. In this review we are going to discuss stress in four aspects: (I) Principles of stress, (II) fundamental mechanisms of the stress response and (III) the relationship between response to stresses and defense mechanisms in three areas of life and (Iv) at the end using stress responses to ameliorate diseases and other applications.

VL  - 41
IS  - 3
SP  - 354-360
AB  - Effective parasitoid production or mass-rearing is one of the key components in practicing biological control with parasitoids. Selection of host species for rearing parasitoids is a major approach to improve the production efficiency. The stone leek leafminer Liriomyza chinensis (Kato) is a destructive pest of onion crops in many Asian countries, which is difficult to control with chemicals. The present study examined whether the production of Neochrysocharis okazakii Kamijo, a promising native biological agent of L. chinensis, could be effective if kidney bean-Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) system was used as an alternative rearing procedure. The suitability of L. chinensis and L. trifolii as hosts of N. okazakii was investigated in the laboratory. Neochrysocharis okazakii completed its development on both two host species, and the total development time was similar on these hosts. Longevity of N. okazakii females provided with L. chinensis was longer than those on L. trifolii. There were no significant differences in fecundity and offspring sex ratio when females had been provided with these two host species. The adult parasitoids emerged from L. chinensis were significantly larger than those from L. trifolii. However, the intrinsic rate of increase was higher, and mean generation time was lower, for L. trifolii than L. chinensis. Thus, mean net reproductive rate (Ro) was higher when L. trifolii was used as host. Although the two host species were equally suitable as host for N. okazakii, our findings suggested that L. trifolii and kidney bean is an ideal system for N. okazakii production.

AB  - We studied the effects of six constant temperatures (7.2, 10.0, 15.5, 21.1, 26.6, and 29.4-degrees-C) on developmental rates and developmental times in four parasites of Diuraphis noxia (Mordwilko) (Homoptera:Aphididae): Aphelinus asychis Walker from Chile, A. asychis W. from France, Aphidius matricariae Haliday from Iraq, and Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) from Pakistan. Differences were not detected in developmental time between sexes in D. rapae at any of the temperatures tested. Males developed faster than females in A. matricariae at 10 and 21.1-degrees-C, A. asychis Chile at 15.5 and 29.4-degrees-C, and A. asychis France at 10, 15.5, and 21.1-degrees-C (P < 0.05). Developmental thresholds (t), and times-to-adult in degree-days (K) of the four parasites are: 7.1-degrees-C and 248.8 for A. asychis Chile, 6.4-degrees-C and 246.7 for A. asychis France, 1.4-degrees-C and 311.4 for A. matricariae, and 2.1-degrees-C and 293.4 for D. rapae, respectively. Based on the predicted accumulation of degree-days and number of generations per year for the four parasites at three climatically distinct localities in California, we concluded that the parasite with the lowest developmental threshold (A. matricariae) may complete ca. 4.5, 3.6, and 2.1 more generations than the parasite with the highest developmental threshold (A. asychis from Chile) at the coldest, intermediate, and warmest localities, respectively. It was suggested that parasites with lower developmental thresholds, despite their generally greater time-to-adult, will have greater population densities following the winter season than parasites with higher developmental thresholds, they may appear earlier and thus have greater potential as effective biological control agents especially in annual crops such as small grains. When attempting to introduce parasites for biological control of a target host the developmental thresholds of both the parasite and the host should be considered in conjunction with other attributes such as searching efficiency, fecundity, host preference, and others.

TI  - Measures for Assessing the Effectiveness of Investments for Electricity and Heat Generation from the Hybrid Cooperation of a Photovoltaic Installation with a Heat Pump on the Example of a Household
VL  - 15
IS  - 16
AB  - In recent years, one of the key postulates in the European Union's policy has become the development of renewable energy sources. In order to achieve the desired synergy effect, the idea of combining two selected sources of energy appeared. This article presents a technical and economic analysis of a hybrid connection of a ground source heat pump with a photovoltaic installation. Taking into account the heat demand of the building, a ground heat pump with a catalog nominal heating power of 25 kW was selected. This article presents the problem of the economic profitability of using a hybrid combination of a heat pump and photovoltaic panels in domestic hot water and central heating systems. The justification for the use of such heat sources in these installations is due to global trends and the gradual departure from conventional energy sources such as oil or gas boilers. This paper presents the economic and ecological results of using the pump heat connected together with photovoltaic panels. In the economic analysis, with the assumed installation costs related to the use of the considered heat pump and PV, two parameters commonly used in the investment analysis (static and dynamic) were used, namely, the simple payback period and the net present value of the investment. For the adopted assumptions, the usable area of the facility and the number of years of use were indicated, at which the investment in question is competitive with other alternative investment interest methods and will start to bring tangible benefits. The performed analysis also has measurable environmental benefits in the form of a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at the level of 2893 kg/year into the atmosphere. The presented solution will help future investors understand the investment profitability mechanism for their households.

TI  - Self-righting potential and the evolution of shell shape in Galapagos tortoises
VL  - 7
AB  - Self-righting, the capacity of an animal to self-turn after falling on its back, is a fitness-related trait. Delayed self-righting can result in loss of mating opportunities or death. Traits involved in self-righting may therefore be under selection. Galapagos giant tortoises have two main shell morphologies saddleback and domed - that have been proposed to be adaptive. The more sloped shape on the sides of the shell and the longer extension of neck and legs of the saddlebacks could have evolved to optimize self-righting. The drier environments with more uneven surfaces where the saddleback tortoises occur increases their risk to fall on their back while walking. The ability to fast overturn could reduce the danger of dying. To test this hypothesis, we used 3D shell reconstructions of 89 Galapagos giant tortoises from three domed and two saddleback species to compare self-righting potential of the two shell morphotypes. Our results indicate that saddleback shells require higher energy input to self-right than domed ones. This suggests that several traits associated with the saddleback shell morphology could have evolved to facilitate self-righting. Studying the functional performances of fitness-related traits, as in this work, could provide important insight into the adaptive value of traits.

TI  - Local extinction risk of three species of lizard from Patagonia as a result of global warming
VL  - 94
IS  - 1
SP  - 49-59
AB  - Recently, Sinervo et al. (2010, Science, 328: 894-899) reported declines of lizard biodiversity due to local warming trends and altered thermal niches. Herein, we applied the Sinervo et al. (2010) physiological model to predict the local extinction risk of three species of lizard from Patagonia. Whereas the previous model used a single equation (for the extinctions of Blue Spiny Lizard (Sceloporus serrifer Cope, 1866) in the Yucatan Peninsula) relating environmental temperatures (T-e) to hours of restriction (i. e., the period when lizards are forced into retreat sites because environmental temperatures are too high), we measured habitat-specific equations for the T-e values of each species. We analyzed the vulnerability of Darwin's Ground Gecko (Homonota darwinii Boulenger, 1885), Bariloche Lizard (Liolaemus pictus (Dumeril and Bibron, 1837)), and Mountain Slope Lizard (Liolaemus elongatus Koslowsky, 1896) to climate change considering thermal physiological constraints on activity during the reproductive period. While Sinervo et al. (2010) predicted that the Phyllodactylidae family will not suffer from impacts of climate change, our physiological model predicted that 20% of the H. darwinii populations could become extinct by 2080. The physiological model also predicted that 15% of L. pictus populations and 26.5% of L. elongatus populations could become extinct by 2080. The most vulnerable populations are those located near the northern and eastern boundaries of their distributions.

TI  - Evolutionary responses to changing climate
VL  - 86
IS  - 7
SP  - 1704-1714
AB  - Until now, Quaternary paleoecologists have regarded evolution as a slow process relative to climate change, predicting that the primary biotic response to changing climate is not adaptation, but instead (1) persistence in situ if changing climate remains within the species' tolerance limits, (2) range shifts (migration) to regions where climate is currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.

TI  - High neutron fluence survivability testing of advanced fiber Bragg grating sensors
VL  - 699
SP  - 650-657
AB  - The motivation for the reported research was to support NASA space nuclear power initiatives through the development of advanced fiber optic sensors for space-based nuclear power applications. The purpose of the high-neutron fluence testing was to demonstrate the survivability of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors in a fission reactor environment. 520 FBGs were installed in the Ford reactor at the University of Michigan. The reactor was operated for 1012 effective full power hours resulting in a maximum neutron fluence of approximately 5 x 10(19) n/cm(2), and a maximum gamma dose of 2 x 10(3) MGy gamma. This work is significant in that, to the knowledge of the authors, the exposure levels obtained are approximately 1000 times higher than for any previously published experiment. Four different fiber compositions were evaluated. An 87% survival rate was observed for fiber Bragg gratings located at the fuel centerline. Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR), originally developed at the NASA Langley Research Center, can be used to interrogate several thousand low-reflectivity FBG strain and/or temperature sensors along a single optical fiber. A key advantage of the OFDR sensor technology for space nuclear power is the extremely low mass of the sensor, which consists of only a silica fiber 125mum in diameter. The sensors produced using this technology will fill applications in nuclear power for current reactor plants, emerging Generation-IV reactors, and for space nuclear power. The reported research was conducted by Luna Innovations and was funded through a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center.

SP  - 748-758
AB  - Lysozyme activity, haemolytic activity, total level of IgM, and levels of antibodies against A-layer from Aeromonas salmonicida and O-antigen from Vibrio salmonicida, respectively, were determined in 77 full-sib groups of Atlantic salmon in order to evaluate their possible use as immune parameters for indirect selection to improve disease resistance. Fish from parallel full-sib groups had previously been challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida (causing furunculosis), Renibacterium salmoninarum (causing bacterial kidney disease, BKD) and Vibrio salmonicida (causing cold-water vibriosis). Heritabilities were estimated for each of the immune parameters and correlations between the least square means of the full-sib groups for the different immune parameters and survival rates in the parallel full-sib groups were determined. A significant genetic variation in lysozyme activity was found, as well as an apparent genetic association between low lysozyme activity and high survival rates. Low heritabilities and low univariate correlations with survival in the full-sib groups were estimated for all of the other immune parameters. An analysis of the multivariate associations between the full-sib mean values of the complete set of immune parameters, and survival rates in the parallel full-sib groups in each of the challenge tests, revealed that, at low levels of lysozyme activity and with low antibody titres against V. salmonicida O-antigen, increased IgM levels seemed to increase survival from furunculosis.

TI  - Terrestrial Salamanders Maintain Habitat Suitability under Climate Change despite Trade-Offs between Water Loss and Gas Exchange*
VL  - 93
IS  - 4
SP  - 310-319
AB  - Physiological acclimation has the potential to improve survival during climate change by reducing sensitivity to warming. However, acclimation can produce trade-offs due to links between related physiological traits. Water loss and gas exchange are intrinsically linked by the need for respiratory surfaces to remain moist. As climates warm and dry, organisms may attempt to lower desiccation risk by limiting water loss but at a cost of inhibiting their ability to breathe. Here we used laboratory experiments to evaluate the trade-off between water loss and gas exchange in a fully terrestrial, lungless salamander (Plethodon metcalfi). We measured acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates in response to long-term exposure to temperature and humidity treatments. We then integrated the trade-off into a simulation-based species distribution model to determine the consequences of ignoring physiological trade-offs on energy balance and aerobic scope under climate change. In the laboratory, we found a close association between acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates indicative of a trade-off. After incorporating the trade-off into our simulations, we found that energy balance and aerobic scope were reduced by 49.7% and 34.3%, respectively, under contemporary climates across their geographic range. Under future warming scenarios, incorporating the trade-off lowered the number of sites predicted to experience local extirpation by 52.2% relative to simulations without the trade-off; however, the number of sites capable of supporting the energetic requirements for reproduction declined from 44.6% to 32.6% across the species' geographic range. These experiments and simulations suggest that salamanders can maintain positive energy balance across their geographic range under climate change despite the costs associated with trade-offs between water loss and gas exchange.

TI  - Genotype by Environment Interaction on Resistance to Cassava Green Mite Associated Traits and Effects on Yield Performance of Cassava Genotypes in Nigeria
VL  - 11
AB  - Cassava is the main source of carbohydrate for over 70% of the people in Nigeria, the world's largest producer and consumer of the crop. The yields of cassava are, however, relatively low in Nigeria largely due to pests and disease infections that significantly lead to inconsistencies in productivity of cassava genotypes in various environments. Fifty-eight F(1)hybrid cassava genotypes plus their two parents which served as check varieties were evaluated in three locations for two years (that is six environments). The objectives of the study were to evaluate genotype by environment interactions (GEI) on resistance to cassava green mite [CGM,Mononychellus tanajoa(Bondar)] associated traits and effects on yield performance of cassava genotypes in Nigeria and to identify superior genotypes that exhibit high stability which combine CGM resistance and high fresh root yield with general and specific environmental adaptation using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). The combined analysis of variance based on AMMI revealed significant genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interactions (GEI) for all traits. The percentage variation due to environment was higher than the percentage variation due to genotype for cassava green mite severity (CGMS), leaf retention (LR), root dry matter content (RDMC), and fresh root yield (FRY) indicating that environment greatly influenced the expression of these traits. The percentage variation due to GEI accounted for higher percentage variation than that of genotype and environment separately for all traits, indicating the influence of genotype by environment interaction on expression of the traits. These findings reveal that screening/evaluating for these traits needs multi-environment trials. According to GSI ranking, genotypes G31 (IBA131794), G19 (IBA131762), the check variety G52 (TMEB778), and G11 (IBA131748) were identified as the most stable and most resistant to CGM which also combine high FRY and other useful agronomic traits, implying that these traits in cassava can even be incorporated as preferred by farmers. These genotypes can be tested in more environments to determine their adaptability and potential recommendation for release to farmers for growing.

AB  - A portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system has been developed with Red Pitaya STEMlab for biomedical applications. The Red Pitaya STEMlab is a portable device to realize voltage generation and data acquisition for the EIT system. The EIT system includes a modified howland circuit as a voltage-controlled current source, a high-speed analogy multiplexer module, an 8-electrode array, and a personal computer. The generalized vector sampled pattern matching algorithm and the Tikhonov regularization algorithm are used to reconstruct the image generated by the EIT system. The reconstructed images by using Red Pitaya STEMlab are compared with a commercial impedance analyzer IM3570 within the frequencies of f = 100 KHz. The results show that the maximum difference of the image correlation between Red Pitaya STEMlab and IM3570 is 5.36%. Finally, the EIT system is used to image the conductivity of eggs during heating process. These results verified that the developed portable EIT system with Red Pitaya STEMlab could measure the biological tissue in a high accuracy at low cost.

VL  - 22

SP  - 328-335
AB  - Advocates of palliative care research have often described the cold and difficult environment that has constrained the development of research internationally. The development of palliative care research has been slow over the last few decades and has met with resistance and sometimes hostility to the idea of conducting research in 'vulnerable populations'. The seeds of advocacy for research can be found in palliative care literature from the 1980s and early 1990s. Although we have much to do, we need to recognize that palliative care research development has come a long way. Of particular note is the development of well-funded collaboratives that now exist in Europe, Canada, Australia and the USA. The European Association for Palliative Care and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care has recognized the need to develop and promote global research initiatives, with a special focus on developing countries. Time is needed to develop good research evidence and in a more complex healthcare environment takes increasingly more resources to be productive. The increased support (global warming) evident in the increased funding opportunities available to palliative care researchers in a number of countries brings both benefits and challenges. There is evidence that the advocacy of individuals such as Kathleen Foley, Neil MacDonald, Balfour Mount, Vittorio Ventafridda, Robert Twycross and Geoff Hanks is now providing fertile ground and a much friendlier environment for a new generation of interdisciplinary palliative care research. We have achieved many of the goals necessary to avoid failure of the 'palliative care experiment', and need to accept the challenge of our present climate and adapt and take advantage of the change.

SP  - 2209-2228
AB  - The present investigation assesses the influence of cultural attributes and heat and cold treatments on the behavior of native toxigenic L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 and non-toxigenic L. innocua CFR 1304 in selected medium. The growth responses of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua under the influencing factors of storage temperature (10-40 degrees C), pH level (5.5-7.5), and storage period (6-48 h) in brain heart infusion and nutrient broths revealed closeness between observed and predicted populations. Response surface plots were generated for the growth behavior of the two test cultures as a function of pH level. The toxigenic L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 could reach a higher viable population. The effect of heat treatment on Listeria spp. in selected five heating menstra showed the lowest D-value of 3.7 min at 60 degrees C for L. innocua CFR 1304 in Milli-Q water to the highest of 8.4 min at 56 degrees C for L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 in skim milk. The average z-value across the heating menstra for L. monocytogenes was 27.3 degrees C as against that of 22 degrees C for L. innocua. In the case of cold treatment, storage of 4 and 8 degrees C resulted in appreciable increase in counts of L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 from the initial inoculum introduced in selected media. At -20 degrees C, there was a slight decrease in the viable population. The research data helps to predict the viable populations of L. monocytogenes as a part of risk assessment in the food chain. This is of significance in providing safe and healthy food to human population.

VL  - 4

AB  - Global climate change (GCC) increasingly threatens biodiversity through the loss of species, and the transformation of entire ecosystems. Many species are challenged by the pace of GCC because they might not be able to respond fast enough to changing biotic and abiotic conditions. Species can respond either by shifting their range, or by persisting in their local habitat. If populations persist, they can tolerate climatic changes through phenotypic plasticity, or genetically adapt to changing conditions depending on their genetic variability and census population size to allow for de novo mutations. Otherwise, populations will experience demographic collapses and species may go extinct. Current approaches to predicting species responses to GCC begin to combine ecological and evolutionary information for species distribution modelling. Including an evolutionary dimension will substantially improve species distribution projections which have not accounted for key processes such as dispersal, adaptive genetic change, demography, or species interactions. However, eco-evolutionary models require new data and methods for the estimation of a species' adaptive potential, which have so far only been available for a small number of model species. To represent global biodiversity, we need to devise large-scale data collection strategies to define the ecology and evolutionary potential of a broad range of species, especially of keystone species of ecosystems. We also need standardized and replicable modelling approaches that integrate these new data to account for eco-evolutionary processes when predicting the impact of GCC on species' survival. Here, we discuss different genomic approaches that can be used to investigate and predict species responses to GCC. This can serve as guidance for researchers looking for the appropriate experimental setup for their particular system. We furthermore highlight future directions for moving forward in the field and allocating available resources more effectively, to implement mitigation measures before species go extinct and ecosystems lose important functions.

TI  - N2O emissions from protected soilless crops for more precise food and urban agriculture life cycle assessments
VL  - 149
SP  - 1118-1126
AB  - Due to population growth and the subsequent increase in the demand for food, low carbon food chain production systems are a necessity to reduce the effects on climate change as much as possible. Urban agriculture is of great interest because of its potential in reducing the indirect CO2 emissions of a city's food supply by reducing transportation distances, the packaging required and the food losses that occur during transportation. However, intensive urban agriculture production, which often relies on the use of soilless substrates, requires synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen, resulting in N2O emissions. Presently, there is a lack of studies that determine the generation of N2O from soilless crops to properly account for their global warming potential. In this study, an open chamber system was used to quantify N2O emissions from lettuce crops with perlite bags as their substrate in a Mediterranean rooftop greenhouse located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). N2O generation, through nitrifying and denitrifying reactions, was limited by assuring an aerobic environment, negligible water retention, the absence of NH3, and controlled dosage of NO3- in the most favorable pH conditions for plant assimilation. The emission factor (EF) measured for the soilless lettuce crop (0.0072-0.0085 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) was half the EF of the IPCC method (0.0125 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) for soil crops, which is commonly used in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to approximate direct N2O emissions, for lack of a better method. Using a more appropriate EF for an LCA study of a tomato crop grown under similar conditions to those used to generate the EF resulted in a 7.5% reduction (0.06 kg CO2 eq. per kilogram of tomato production) in total global warming potential. This study shows that soilless crops reduce N2O emissions when compared to conventional crops, making urban agriculture an attractive practice for reducing GHG emissions. The results highlight the need to determine a standard method for determining an EF applicable to soilless protected crops, which, based on the parameters described here, such as the type of substrate, fertilizers and irrigation system, would allow for a more accurate environmental evaluation of soilless conventional and urban crops.

TI  - Predicting the timing of first generation egg hatch for the pest redlegged earth mite Halotydeus destructor (Acari: Penthaleidae)
VL  - 65
IS  - 3
SP  - 259-276
AB  - Integrated pest management in Australian winter grain crops is challenging, partly because the timing and severity of pest outbreaks cannot currently be predicted, and this often results in prophylactic applications of broad spectrum pesticides. We developed a simple model to predict the median emergence in autumn of pest populations of the redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor, a major field crop and pasture pest in southern Australia. Previous data and observations suggest that rainfall and temperature are critical for post-diapause egg hatch. We evaluated seven models that combined rainfall and temperature thresholds derived using three approaches against previously recorded hatch dates and 2013 field records. The performance of the models varied between Western Australia and south-eastern Australian States. In Western Australia, the key attributes of the best fitting model were more than 5 mm rain followed by mean day temperatures of below 20.5 A degrees C for 10 days. In south-eastern Australia, the most effective model involved a temperature threshold reduced to 16 A degrees C. These regional differences may reflect adaptation of H. destructor in south-eastern Australia to varied and uncertain temperature and rainfall regimes of late summer and autumn, relative to the hot and dry Mediterranean-type climate in Western Australia. Field sampling in 2013 revealed a spread of early hatch dates in isolated patches of habitat, ahead of predicted paddock scale hatchings. These regional models should assist in monitoring and subsequent management of H. destructor at the paddock scale.

TI  - THERMAL PREFERENCE INCREASES DURING LARVAL DEVELOPMENT OF PURE AND HYBRID ABALONE
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-149
AB  - Temperature is one of the main factors influencing biological processes of ectothermic species. An optimum temperature of 16-18 degrees C has been suggested for the development of early life stages of temperate Australian abalone, yet there are little physiological or behavioral data to support this suggestion. This study examines the acute thermal preferences (Tpref), swimming speeds (U), and oxygen consumption rates (MO2) of veliger larvae of blacklip abalone [Haliotis rubra (Leach, 1814)], greenlip abalone [Haliotis laevigata (Donovan, 1808)], and their interspecies hybrid. Thermal preference and U were measured in a thermal gradient with temperatures ranging from 12 degrees C to 25 degrees C, and MO2 was measured at 4-7 temperatures between 12 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Thermal preference increased in all three groups of abalone during development from a Tpref of 16 degrees C in 1-day-old early veligers to a Tpref of 20 degrees C in 3-day-old late veligers. Swimming speed increased with temperature in all three groups of abalone and increased with age in H. rubra and hybrids but not in H. laevigata. Veliger MO2 increased throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range in all three abalone groups. Higher temperatures were examined in hybrids, and it was found that MO2 reached a peak at 25 degrees C and declined thereafter. These results align with the temperatures that veligers may experience in their natural habitat and provide support that current temperatures maintained at Australian aquaculture hatcheries are within optimal ranges for larval performance.

TI  - STUDIES ON THE CONTROL OF HETEROGONOUS REPRODUCTION IN ROTIFERS .4. THE REACTIVATION OF MICTIC POTENTIAL IN BRACHIONUS-URCEOLARIS
VL  - 96
IS  - 1
SP  - 97-165
AB  - The mictic potential denotes the capacity of amictic eggs to react to mixis-inducing environmental conditions. This potential of three clones (A1, W1, and W2) of Brachionus urceolaris was lost step by step when the animals kept in mixis-inducing conditions (20-degrees-C) for long time. Finally, they were completely amictic. But in a mixis-suppressing environment (10-degrees-C), they slowly regained their mictic potential. It is the aim of this paper to describe the quantitative relations between the time of exposure to low temperature (10-degrees-C) and the reactivation of the mictic potential. The animals of clone A1 are almost completely amictic at 10-degrees-C. A transfer to 20-degrees-C causes a mictic reaction: After a short time, the percentage of mictic females increases to a maximum and then decreases again to lower values. These percentages measure the mictic potential, which is determined by the time, they were kept at 10-degrees-C. When the cultures were continued at 20-degrees-C, the mictic percentage reaches zero. The time needed until this happens, is again determined by the duration of preceeding culture at 10-degrees-C. But this relation is not very strict. Therefore the time the animals were kept at 10-degrees-C cannot be attributed to definite percentages or definite rates of their decrease: The process of reactivation is very variable. So the different experiments agree only qualitatively, but not in the precise percentages and times. When the animals of the two W-clones were continuously cultivated at 20-degrees-C, they became purely amictic, too. But here, contrary to A1, mictic females appeared immediately after the transfer of these amictic females to 10-degrees-C. The percentage of mictic females stayed rather high for some years. The physiological mechanism causing this mixis could not be clarified as yet. In any case, it is not identical with the mictic potential, which admits mixis in warm environment. For, if amictic females were transferred back to warm environment during the first 4 weeks of cold cultivation, then they and all their descendants were unable of mixis, although their sisters continuously produced mictic daughters at 10-degrees-C. Only after 4 weeks of cold cultivation, the rise of temperature induced a weak reaction that increased with the duration of the cultivation at 10-degrees-C. Also the time needed for the clones to become amictic after the first reaction, depends on the duration of the preceeding cold cultivation. As for A1, the mictic potential was very variable. So parallel experiments run under the same conditions gave quantitatively different results. A fourth clone A4 continuously produced mictic females although it was cultivated at 20-degrees-C for years. So contrary to the other clones, it did not lose its mictic potential. At 10-degrees-C, the animals became amictic and could produce mictic daughters immediately after they were put back into warm environment. The material basis of the mictic potential is not known. Its variability is controlled by external conditions. This shows that it is not located in the chromosomes, but in the plasma. Each of its states may be transferred to the daughter cells. Also at every mictic reaction, the mictic potential is changed, as two antagonistic processes occur and generate the sinuoidal shape of the reaction. The mictic determination is a process, which sets up the mictic inductor in several steps by means of the energy supplied by an external impulse. The intermediate steps admit only ameiotic oogenesis. Only the final step stimulates meiosis. As the intermediate steps can be inherited, the determination may drag on over some generations even without a new impulse. It seems that occasionally it can start also spontaneously, i.e. without an external impulse.

TI  - Ultrafast Solar-Vapor Harvesting Based on a Hierarchical Porous Hydrogel with Wettability Contrast and Tailored Water States
AB  - Optimizing the water bonding network in an evaporator is significant for efficient solar-driven vapor generation (SVG). Herein, we report a facile one-pot method to regulate the hydrated structure and wettability in a hierarchical porous hydrogel. An ovalbumin (OVA)-polyacrylamide hydrogel foam was fabricated in a cake-making fashion. Because of the enrichment of amphiphilic OVA at the interface, the hydrophobic walls of the air pores in the foam provide vaporization sites and help reduce parasitic heat loss, while the hydrophilic skeleton with the secondary pores effectively pumps capillary water. Notably, the proportion of intermediate water in the foam reaches 87.6% with the melting point as low as -10 degrees C. All these features contribute to an exceptional evaporation rate of 3.4-4.5 kg m(-2) h(-1) under 1 sun and robust SVG performances at high-humidity, weak sunlight, or cold weathers. The strategy of using amphiphilic molecules to optimize the hydrated structures both at the interface and in bulk promises the reasonable design of SVG materials with superior efficiency and weather adaptability.

TI  - High and low temperatures differently affect infection density and vertical transmission of male-killing Spiroplasma symbionts in Drosophila hosts
VL  - 74
IS  - 19
SP  - 6053-6059
AB  - We investigated the vertical transmission, reproductive phenotype, and infection density of a male-killing Spiroplasma symbiont in two Drosophila species under physiological high and low temperatures through successive host generations. In both the native host Drosophila nebulosa and the nonnative host Drosophila melanogaster, the symbiont infection and the male-killing phenotype were stably maintained at 25 degrees C, rapidly lost at 18 degrees C, and gradually lost at 28 degrees C. In the nonnative host, both the high and low temperatures significantly suppressed the infection density of the spiroplasma. In the native host, by contrast, the low temperature suppressed the infection density of the spiroplasma whereas the high temperature had little effect on the infection density. These results suggested that the low temperature suppresses both the infection density and the vertical transmission of the spiroplasma whereas the high temperature suppresses the vertical transmission preferentially. The spiroplasma density was consistently higher in the native host than in the nonnative host, suggesting that the host genotype may affect the infection density of the symbiont. The temperature- and genotype-dependent instability of the symbiont infection highlights a complex genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interaction and may be relevant to the low infection frequencies of the male-killing spiroplasmas in natural Drosophila populations.

VL  - 15

SP  - 9-17
AB  - When reared in the greenhouse, the rice skipper, Pelopidas mathias (F.) (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), laid 2-3 times fewer eggs than field collected females held under the same conditions. Adult-emergence and mating/oviposition cages may have to be placed in environmental chambers with controlled temperature and photoperiod to achieve normal mating and oviposition. Rearing required a mating/oviposition-cage at least 3 m3 in volume and honey as sustenance. Eggs and larvae were held in larval rearing cages and pupae were removed and held in adult emergence cages. Maximum oviposition occurred at dawn. The total developmental period from egg to adult was 34.7 days. P. mathias demonstrated a greater oviposition preference for rice and Paspalum conjugatum Berg. than for Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd. P. mathias successfully developed to adulthood on all 24 species of Poaceae tested, exclusive of rice, but did not survive on the six species of Cyperaceae tested. Low populations of P. mathias in rice can be attributed to its low fecundity, wide host range, and equal adaptability to upland and lowland environments, thus diluting its number.

TI  - Integrating plant ecological responses to climate extremes from individual to ecosystem levels
VL  - 372
IS  - 1723
AB  - Climate extremes will elicit responses from the individual to the ecosystem level. However, only recently have ecologists begun to synthetically assess responses to climate extremes across multiple levels of ecological organization. We review the literature to examine how plant responses vary and interact across levels of organization, focusing on how individual, population and community responses may inform ecosystem-level responses in herbaceous and forest plant communities. We report a high degree of variability at the individual level, and a consequential inconsistency in the translation of individual or population responses to directional changes in community-or ecosystem-level processes. The scaling of individual or population responses to community or ecosystem responses is often predicated upon the functional identity of the species in the community, in particular, the dominant species. Furthermore, the reported stability in plant community composition and functioning with respect to extremes is often driven by processes that operate at the community level, such as species niche partitioning and compensatory responses during or after the event. Future research efforts would benefit from assessing ecological responses across multiple levels of organization, as this will provide both a holistic and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to increasing climatic variability. This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.

TI  - Simulating the indirect handline jigging effects on the European squid Loligo vulgaris in captivity
VL  - 110
IS  - 3
SP  - 435-440
AB  - The European squid Loligo vulgaris is an important target species of commercial and recreational fisheries in the NW Mediterranean. Handline jigging is one of the most common fishing gears used by both of these fisheries to catch squid, which are trapped when they try to seize the lure with their tentacles. An unknown but possibly significant number of squid are able to escape from this gear by losing one or both of their tentacles (drop off rate). Between April and July 2010, two sets of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions were carried out to test (n = 15 squid) the indirect effects of tentacle loss on predation success and predation behaviour. The first set of experiments consisted of estimating the number of attacks and time spent until a squid with no (n = 5), one (n 5) or two tentacles (n = 5) successfully caught a prey item. Independent trials were carried out with two prey types with very different swimming capabilities (fish and shrimp). The second set of experiments consisted of prey-selectivity trials to determine whether squid prefer fish or shrimp when both are available. The results obtained clearly demonstrate not only that squid missing tentacles have a reduced predation performance but also that they can change predation preferences and predation behaviour. These changes might negatively affect the condition of injured squid (reduced fitness). Consequently, the possibility of squid losing their tentacles deserves more attention in the management decisions for the squid fishery. This indirect handline jigging effect may imply unreported fishing mortality (ghost fishing) that should be considered when making management decisions for this important fishery.

VL  - 7
IS  - 42
SP  - 24626-24640
AB  - Electronic sensors mimicking the function of human skin are promising for the next generation of bionic skin. In this paper, we present a facile and novel approach to prepare an electronic sensor using a physically crosslinked protein hydrogel from egg white with the capability of incorporating conductive nanomaterials. The current strategy led to the formation of extraordinarily stretchable hydrogels in which their shear-thinning and self-healing properties further enabled direct ink writing 3D printing at room temperature, providing novel insights into the biosensor fabrication process. Furthermore, we enhanced the mechanical properties of these hydrogels by introducing secondary physical crosslinking to better resemble human skin. For electronic skin demonstration, a directly 3D printed sensor (EW-CNT sensor) was fabricated with embedding of carbon nanotubes and utilized to capture the delicate wrist pulse, distant reflection of index finger flexion, and respiration as well as vigorous finger bending. Notably, the radial augmentation index and stiffness index of the cardiovascular system could be clearly revealed by the EW-CNT sensor recording. Moreover, the EW hydrogel can be used to fabricate a reversible humidity actuator through a porous gradient architecture. The advantages of the current hydrogel platform including low cost, easy handling, and ease of fabrication for scale-up may open new horizons in the field of epidermal sensors and actuators.

TI  - Non-migratory monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus (L.), retain developmental plasticity and a navigational mechanism associated with migration
VL  - 123
IS  - 2
SP  - 265-278
AB  - Monarch butterflies are best known from their migratory North American range, although many resident, year-round breeding populations are established throughout the world. Here, we evaluate two non-exclusive hypotheses for the loss of migration in resident monarch populations: (1) absence of cues that trigger migration; and (2) loss of sensory, neural or physiological systems required for migration. To evaluate the first hypothesis, we exposed resident monarchs from Queensland, Australia to decreasing larval photoperiod and observed reproductive development in resulting females to assess their propensity to show reduced reproductive development, a precursor for long-distance migration. To address the second hypothesis, we measured antennal circadian clock gene expression, a crucial element of the monarch's ability to orientate directionally, in a resident and a migratory population. We found that Australian resident monarchs show reduced reproductive development in response to decreasing photoperiod, consistent with the 'loss of cues' hypothesis. We found no differences in antennal clock gene expression between migratory and resident populations, inconsistent with the 'loss of mechanism' hypothesis. Together, these data indicate that even after hundreds of generations of non-migration, monarchs retain two crucial elements of their migratory repertoire: developmental plasticity associated with decreasing photoperiod and antennal circadian rhythms necessary for directional orientation.

VL  - 11
IS  - 4
AB  - Forest ecosystems are strongly impacted by extreme climate, and the age effects of radial growth under drought can provide profound understanding of the adaptation strategy of a tree species to climate change. Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. & C.A. Mey) trees of three age groups (young, middle-aged, and old) were collected to establish the tree-ring width chronologies in the eastern Tianshan Mountains of northwestern China. Meanwhile, we analyzed and compared the response and resistance disparities of radial growth to drought in trees of different age groups. The results showed that (1) drought stress caused by increasing temperatures was the main factor limiting the radial growth of Schrenk spruce, (2) the old and young trees were more susceptible to drought stress than the middle-aged trees, as suggested by the responses of Schrenk spruce trees and based on the SPEI (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index), and (3) the difference of the resistance indexes (resistance, recovery, resilience, and relative resilience) of three age groups to drought supported that the resistance values were in the order middle age > young age > old age, but the recovery, resilience, and relative resilience values were in the order old age > young age > middle age. These results will provide a basis for the ecological restoration and scientific management of dominant coniferous tree species of different age groups in the sub-alpine forest ecosystems of the arid regions under climate change scenarios.

VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 453-462
AB  - Previous laboratory studies on the cyclic parthenogen, Daphnia magna Straus, demonstrated marked differences in the survivorship and fecundity of clones in response to temperature. Here, I examine the extent to which similar ecological differentiation exists within a natural population by using isozymes as genetic markers to distinguish clonal groups. The frequency and fecundity (parthenogenetic and sexual) of Daphnia magna genotypes that were electrophoretically marked at the phosphoglucose isomerase locus (PGI, E. C. 5.3.1.9) were recorded for 2 years (July 1981-July 1983) at six sites within a lake. Fecundity was estimated by determining the absolute fecundity (mean number of parthenogenetic eggs per adult female) and reproductive ratios (the proportion of adult females with eggs) of each PGI genotype. There were extensive fluctuations in genotype frequency during each year, but changes were remarkably uniform throughout the lake, suggesting selective responses to seasonal variables. Two of the PGI genotypes (Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100)) exhibited seasonal succession over 2 years, predominating respectively in summer and winter, and changes in frequency were significantly correlated with genotypic differences in parthenogenetic egg production. At certain times of the year, up to 10-fold differences in the relative fecundity of genotypes were recorded, suggesting marked ecological differentiation between PGI genotypes. The persistence of PGI fitness differences was checked by re-sampling the population in January and July 1987. Genotype frequencies and fecundities were in keeping with predictions based on original samples: high fitnesses of Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100) genotypes in summer and winter respectively. Findings demonstrate rapid responses to selection pressures, which in the present population were adaptively significant.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: In recent years, a steadily growing number of chemists, from both academia and industry, have dedicated their research to the development of continuous flow processes performed in milli- or microreactors. The common availability of continuous flow equipment at virtually all scales and affordable cost has additionally impacted this trend. Furthermore, regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration actively encourage continuous manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with the vision of quality and productivity improvements. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is progressively implementing continuous flow technologies. As a result of the exceptional characteristics of continuous flow reactors such as small reactor volumes and remarkably fast heat and mass transfer, process conditions which need to be avoided in conventional batch syntheses can be safely employed. Thus, continuous operation is particularly advantageous for reactions at high temperatures/pressures (novel process windows) and for ultrafast, exothermic reactions (flash chemistry). In addition to conditions that are outside of the operation range of conventional stirred tank reactors, reagents possessing a high hazard potential and therefore not amenable to batch processing can be safely utilized (forbidden chemistry). Because of the small reactor volumes, risks in case of a failure are minimized. Such hazardous reagents often are low molecular weight compounds, leading generally to the most atom-, time-, and cost-efficient route toward the desired product. Ideally, they are generated from benign, readily available and cheap precursors within the closed environment of the flow reactor on-site on-demand. By doing so, the transport, storage, and handling of those compounds, which impose a certain safety risk especially on a large scale, are circumvented. This strategy also positively impacts the global supply chain dependency, which can be a severe issue, particularly in times of stricter safety regulations or an epidemic. The concept of the in situ production of a hazardous material is generally referred to as the "generator" of the material. Importantly, in an integrated flow process, multiple modules can be assembled consecutively, allowing not only an in-line purification/separation and quenching of the reagent, but also its downstream conversion to a nonhazardous product. For the past decade, research in our group has focused on the continuous generation of hazardous reagents using a range of reactor designs and experimental techniques, particularly toward the synthesis of APIs. In this Account, we therefore introduce chemical generator concepts that have been developed in our laboratories for the production of toxic, explosive, and short-lived reagents. We have defined three different classes of generators depending on the reactivity/stability of the reagents, featuring reagents such as Br-2, HCN, peracids, diazomethane (CH2N2), or hydrazoic acid (HN3). The various reactor designs, including in-line membrane separation techniques and real-time process analytical technologies for the generation, purification, and monitoring of those hazardous reagents, and also their downstream transformations are presented. This Account should serve as food for thought to extend the scope of chemical generators for accomplishing more efficient and more economic processes.

TI  - Acute and Chronic Toxicity Effects of Silver Nanoparticles (NPs) on Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 45
IS  - 11
SP  - 4974-4979
AB  - The use of nanoscaled materials is rapidly increasing, however, their possible ecotoxicological effects are still not precisely known. This work constitutes the first complex study focused on in vivo evaluation of the acute and chronic toxic effects and toxic limits of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on the eukaryotic organism Drosophila melanogaster. For the purpose of this study, silver NPs were prepared in the form of solid dispersion using microencapsulation method, where mannitol was used as an encapsulation agent. This newly prepared solid dispersion with a high concentration of silver NPs was exploited to prepare the standard Drosophila culture medium at a silver concentration range from 10 mg . L-1 to 100 mg . L-1 of Ag in the case of the acute toxicity testing and at a concentration equal to S mg . L in the case of the chronic toxicity testing. The acute toxic effect of silver NPs on Drosophila melanogaster was observed for the silver concentration equal to 20 mg . L-1. At this silver concentration, 50% of the tested flies were unable to leave the pupae, and they did not finish their developmental cycle. Chronic toxicity of silver NPs was assessed by a long-term exposure of overall eight filial generations of Drosophila melanogaster to silver NPs. The long-term exposure to silver NPs influenced the fertility of Drosophila during the first three filial generations, nevertheless the fecundity of flies in subsequent generations consequently increased up to the level of the flies from the control sample due to the adaptability of flies to the silver NPs exposure.

AB  - Background/Aim: Functional and quantitative Treg cell defects have been identified in a variety of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, Tregs are a major pharmaceutical target for these disorders. In the last decades, studies have been mainly focused on the identification and experimental understanding of the activity of Tregs and their mechanisms of action. Materials and methods: This study describes how overnight storage of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in different media (PBS pH 7.3, PBS pH 7.3 containing 0.5% BSA, RPMI 1640 and RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS) affects the viability and expression of the commonly used markers for Tregs identification: CD25, CD127, CTLA-4, GITR, PD-1, FoxP3 and Helios. Results: Incorrectly selected storage conditions (temperature, time, medium) may affect the expression of surface and intracellular markers, thus, compromising the quality of the obtained results. Conclusion: Appropriate protocols of cell isolation and storage are important for providing appropriate conditions for cell growth. This is crucial when analyzing small cell populations like Tregs.

TI  - Thermal heterogeneity of selected retreats in cool-temperate viviparous lizards suggests a potential benefit of future climate warming
VL  - 97
AB  - Rocky retreats are limited and geologically constrained resources for rock-dwelling nocturnal lizards. Such lizards should seek retreats that offer thermoregulatory benefits without the risk of overheating during the day, and that protect from predation. For cold-adapted species where air temperature is frequently lower than optimum temperature for performance, factors influencing retreat-site selection and whether future warmer conditions will force superficial rock slabs to be abandoned on hot days remain poorly known. Here, we predicted that retreats selected by a nocturnally foraging, cool-temperate gecko from southern New Zealand would be thermally heterogeneous and that future warmer temperature will force lizards to abandon daytime retreats on hot days. We sampled loose rock slabs (potential retreats) in a tussock-grassland site in all seasons. We measured seasonal rock temperature profiles and field body temperature (Tb) of captured geckos using thermography and quantified the physical characteristics of each potential retreat. We found that both physical characteristics and rock temperatures determine choice of retreats. Field Tb of lizards positively correlated with retreat and air temperatures. Also, retreat temperatures, including those of the substrate below the rock slabs, showed complex heterogeneity enabling lizards to choose microsites within retreats to achieve preferred body temperatures intermittently. Observed seasonal shifts in characteristics of occupied rocks imply that lizards choose retreats to maximise warmth in spring, minimise risk of overheating (remain below voluntary thermal maximum, VTmax) in summer and avoid freezing over winter. Our study demonstrates the importance of microclimatic conditions in influencing retreat-site selection. Climate warming might lead to seasonal changes in use of rock slabs and possibly be beneficial initially, but longer-term implications need to be examined.

TI  - Environmental Stress Responses and Experimental Handling Artifacts of a Model Organism, the Copepod Acartia tonsa (Dana)
VL  - 5
AB  - Handling animals during experiments potentially affects the differential expression of genes chosen as biomarkers of sub-lethal stress. RNA sequencing was used to examine whole-transcriptome responses caused by laboratory handling of the calanoid copepod, Acartia tonsa. Salinity shock (S = 35 to S = 5) was used as positive stress control; individuals not exposed to handling or other stressors served as negative stress control. All copepods were grown from eggs to adults without being handled or exposed to any stressors prior the experiment. Survival of nauplii and adults was estimated for up to 10 min of exposure to handling stress and salinity shock. Only adults exhibited decreased survival (44 +/- 7% with 10 min of exposure) in response to handling stress and were selected for definitive experiments for RNA sequencing. After 10 min of experimental exposures to handling stress or salinity shock, adults were incubated for 15 min or 24 h at normal culture conditions. A small number of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed 15 min after exposure to handling stress (2 DEGs) or salinity shock (7 DEGs). However, 24 h after exposure, handling stress resulted in 276 DEGs and salinity shock resulted in 573 DEGs, of which 174 DEGs were overlapping between the treatments. Among the DEGs observed 24 h after exposure to handling stress or salinity shock, some commonly-used stress biomarkers appeared at low levels. This suggests that a stress-response was induced at the transcriptional level for these genes between 15 min and 24 h following exposure. Since handling stress clearly affects transcriptional patterns, it is important to consider handling when designing experiments, by either including additional controls or avoiding focus on impacted genes. Not considering handling in gene expression studies can lead to inaccurate conclusions. The present study provides a baseline for studying handling stress in future studies using this model organism and others.

TI  - The role of intraspecific variation in the ecological and evolutionary success of diatoms in changing environments
VL  - 372
IS  - 1728
AB  - Intraspecific variation in diatoms has been shown to play a key role in species' responses to several important environmental factors such as light, salinity, temperature and nutrients. Furthermore, modelling efforts indicate that this variation within species extends bloom periods, and likely provides sufficient variability in competitive interactions between species under hydrographically variable conditions. The intraspecific variation most likely corresponds to optimal fitness in temporary microhabitats and may help to explain the paradox of the plankton. Here, we examine the implications of intraspecific variation for the ecology and success of diatoms in general and emphasize the potential implications for our understanding of carbon metabolism in these important organisms. Additionally, data from palaeoecological studies have the potential for evaluating genetic variation through past climate changes, going thousands of years back in time. We suggest pathways for future research including the adoption of multiple strains of individual species into studies of diatom carbon metabolism, to refine our understanding of the variation within and between species, and the inclusion of experimental evolution as a tool for understanding potential evolutionary responses of diatom carbon metabolism to climate change.

TI  - Defoliation triggered by climate induced effects in Spanish ICP Forests monitoring plots
VL  - 331
SP  - 245-255
AB  - In a context of global change, climate impacts can trigger defoliation processes in different forest species. The ICP Forests network estimates the level of forest defoliation over time in different European countries. Those data are used to related defoliation with potential causal factors. In European Southwestern forests, climate change appears to be the detonating factor of generalized defoliation. The objectives of this study were: (i) identity defoliation trends in forest trees at network of Spanish ICP Forests monitoring plots and, (ii) find out if there are underlying climate factors that trigger defoliation process along the time. The spatiotemporal synchronization of the defoliation response was analyzed with cross-correlation using COFECHA software. The relationship between the 88 climatic variables proposed and defoliation was analyzed using Correlated Component Regression models (CCR models) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The significance of the variables in each model was compared using contingency tables. A peak of defoliation was observed in the mid-1990s with no recovered to the initial values of the early 1990s. The behavior of the different tree species with respect to defoliation, synchronized both in time and space, involves one or several factors that have a general and similar effect on forests in Spain. The most significant factors related to defoliation were the thermal-related factors, particularly average temperatures in April and June and the thermal oscillation of both the current year and the previous year. Only one drought indicator as statistically significant was identified (A, duration of aridity in months) and suggests that it is of limited relevance in the Spanish forest defoliation conditions.

TI  - Genetics of resistance to photobacteriosis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) using 2b-RAD sequencing
VL  - 19
AB  - Background: Photobacteriosis is an infectious disease developed by a Gram-negative bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), which may cause high mortalities (90-100%) in sea bream. Selection and breeding for resistance against infectious diseases is a highly valuable tool to help prevent or diminish disease outbreaks, and currently available advanced selection methods with the application of genomic information could improve the response to selection. An experimental group of sea bream juveniles was derived from a Ferme Marine de Douhet (FMD, Oleron Island, France) selected line using similar to 109 parents (similar to 25 females and 84 males). This group of 1187 individuals represented 177 full-sib families with 1-49 sibs per family, which were challenged with virulent Phdp for a duration of 18 days, and mortalities were recorded within this duration. Tissue samples were collected from the parents and the recorded offspring for DNA extraction, library preparation using 2b-RAD and genotyping by sequencing. Genotypic data was used to develop a linkage map, genome wide association analysis and for the estimation of breeding values. Results: The analysis of genetic variation for resistance against Phdp revealed moderate genomic heritability with estimates of similar to 0.32. A genome-wide association analysis revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) including 11 SNPs at linkage group 17 presenting significant association to the trait with p-value crossing genome-wide Bonferroni corrected threshold P <= 2.22e-06. The proportion total genetic variance explained by the single top most significant SNP was ranging from 13.28-16.14% depending on the method used to compute the variance. The accuracies of predicting breeding values obtained using genomic vs. pedigree information displayed 19-24% increase when using genomic information. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that SNPs-based genotyping of a sea bream population with 2b-RAD approach is effective at capturing the genetic variation for resistance against Phdp. Prediction accuracies obtained using genomic information were significantly higher than the accuracies obtained using pedigree information which highlights the importance and potential of genomic selection in commercial breeding programs.

VL  - 208
SP  - 34-39
AB  - In the present study, FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the freeze-thaw cycle of two cellular lines (HuDe and Jurkat) suspended in three different media: phosphate buffer solution (PBS); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/ PBS solution at 0.1 DMSO molar fraction; and CryoSure (0.1 DMSO molar fraction PBS solution + dextran 5% w/v) solution. The Trypan Blue test was also applied before freezing and after thawing each cell sample to estimate the recovery of membrane integrity after thermal treatment, and correlate this datum with spectroscopic results. By following the temperature evolution of two different spectral components (the libration and bending combination mode v(c)(H2O) at 2000-2500 cm(-1), and the methylene symmetric stretching vibration v(sym)(CH2) at about 2850 cm(-1)) in the -120 divided by 28 degrees C range, we evidenced the main transition of lipid membrane in connection with cell dehydration, as induced by ice formation in the extracellular medium. In particular, in DMSO/PBS and CryoSure samples we observed a transition to a more rigid state of the lipid membrane together with an increased amount of non-freezable water in the extracellular medium; these results are connected to the role of DMSO as a cryoprotective agent irrespective of the nature of cell type.

SP  - 301-312
AB  - Field body temperature records from seven species of Thamnophis were used to investigate intrageneric variation of body temperature selection under field conditions. There was no evidence for geographic or interspecific variation of thermal preferenda in Thamnophis. Major factors imposing constraints or influencing body temperature were found to be season, weather, macrohabitat, time of day, reproductive status, and activity type. After controlling for these factors, field-selected body temperatures converged on an apparent intragenerically stable preferendum near 30 C, with means ranging from 28.04-30.53 C for the study populations. Observations on thermoregulatory behavior suggest that behavioral adjustments compensate for thermal differences among habitats and across latitude. Review of the literature revealed that intrageneric variation of PBT in snakes has yet to be demonstrated unequivocally. The potential significance of, and possible reasons for, the conservatism of PBT in snakes are discussed in terms of stabilizing selection and plasticity of activity timing in the diel cycle.

TI  - Low temperature-induced variation in plasma biochemical indices and aquaglyceroporin gene expression in the large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea
VL  - 9
AB  - Low temperature influences multiple physiological processes in fish. To explore the adaptability of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) to low temperature, the concentrations of glycerol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma, as well as the expression levels of metabolism-related genes aqp7 and aqp10, were measured after exposure to low temperature stress and during subsequent rewarming. In addition, tissue samples from the intestine and liver were histologically analyzed. We found that the concentrations of plasma glycerol, BUN, and TG, decreased under low temperature stress, suggesting the metabolism of fat and protein slowed at low temperature. The expression levels of aqp7 and aqp10 mRNA were also downregulated under exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, above plasma indices and gene expression returned to basic levels within 24 h after rewarming. Furthermore, the liver and the intestine were damaged under continuous low temperature stress, whereas they were repaired upon rewarming. From the above results, we concluded that aqp7 and aqp10 genes were sensitive to low temperature, and that the decrease in their expression levels at low temperature might reduce energy consumption by L. crocea. However, the adaptation to low temperature was limited because the key metabolic tissues were damaged under continuous exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, the metabolism of L. crocea was basically back to normal within 24 h of rewarming, showing that it has high capacity of self-recovery.

AB  - A study of the experimental conditions to synthesize monodisperse iron oxide nanocrystals prepared from the thermal decomposition of iron(III) acetylacetonate was carried out in the presence of surfactants and a reducing agent. The influence of temperature, synthesis time and surfactant amounts on nanoparticle properties is reported. This investigation combines relaxometric characterization and size properties. The relaxometric behavior of the nanomaterials depends on the selected experimental parameters. The synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles with a high relaxivity and a high saturation magnetization can be obtained with a short reaction time at high temperature. Moreover, the influence of surfactant concentrations determines the optimal value in order to produce iron oxide nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The optimized synthesis is rapid, robust and reproductive, and produces nearly monodisperse magnetic nanocrystals.

TI  - Adaptive divergence and underlying mechanisms in response to salinity gradients between two Crassostrea oysters revealed by phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses
AB  - Comparing the responses of closely related species to environmental changes is an efficient method to explore adaptive divergence, for a better understanding of the adaptive evolution of marine species under rapidly changing climates. Oysters are keystone species thrive in intertidal and estuarine areas where frequent environmental disturbance occurs including fluctuant salinity. The evolutionary divergence of two sister species of sympatric estuarine oysters, Crassostrea hongkongensis and Crassostrea ariakensis, in response to euryhaline habitats on phenotypes and gene expression, and the relative contribution of species effect, environment effect, and their interaction to the divergence were explored. After a 2-month outplanting at high- and low-salinity locations in the same estuary, the high growth rate, percent survival, and high tolerance indicated by physiological parameters suggested that the fitness of C. ariakensis was higher under high-salinity conditions and that of C. hongkongensis was higher under low-salinity conditions. Moreover, a transcriptomic analysis showed the two species exhibited differentiated transcriptional expression in high- and low-salinity habitats, largely caused by the species effect. Several of the important pathways enriched in divergent genes between species were also salinity-responsive pathways. Specifically, the pyruvate and taurine metabolism pathway and several solute carriers may contribute to the hyperosmotic adaptation of C. ariakensis, and some solute carriers may contribute to the hypoosmotic adaptation of C. hongkongensis. Our findings provide insights into the phenotypic and molecular mechanisms underlying salinity adaptation in marine mollusks, which will facilitate the assessment of the adaptive capacity of marine species in the context of climate change and will also provide practical information for marine resource conservation and aquaculture.

TI  - Gone with the wind: short- and long-term responses of leaf-cutting ants to the negative effect of wind on their foraging activity
VL  - 27
IS  - 4
SP  - 1017-1024
AB  - The fitness and survival of organisms ultimately depend on their feeding. Therefore, foraging behaviors should be selected to maximize cost-benefit ratio. Wind may restrict and modify animal movements increasing the cost of foraging, especially when the animal carries resources that intercept wind. We quantified the effect of wind on the foraging of leaf-cutting ants and evaluated whether this effect varies with 1) leaf fragment traits, such as area, mass, and shape, and 2) the characteristics of the foraging trail system. We also tested whether these ants show a short-term response to wind by selecting loads with characteristics that reduce wind interception, and a long-term response, by arranging the spatial design of the trail system in a way that reduces that effect. We found that in windy conditions, the speed of loaded ants was reduced by 55%, and ants were blown off the trail 28 times more than in windless conditions. However, wind only affected ants walking along trails that were perpendicular to wind direction or parallel upwind. Wind effect increased with area, mass, and shape of loads. At the short term, ants reduced the negative effect of wind by selecting smaller, lighter, or more elongated loads. However, trails showed no particular spatial distribution in relation to wind direction. This is the first study that quantifies the negative consequences of wind on leaf-cutting ants' foraging and reports behaviors that can reduce this effect. Our work illustrates how short-term behavioral responses can mitigate the negative effect of an understudied environmental factor on ant foraging.

VL  - 228
SP  - 122-134
AB  - Crop simulation models offer possibilities to evaluate and target agricultural information for sustainable intensification in countries like Ethiopia with inadequate resources for field research. The objectives of this research were to calibrate and evaluate the CERES-Maize, CROPGRO-Dry bean and CROPGRO-Soybean models for practices associated with conservation agriculture and fertilizer N, and to evaluate five generated weather datasets for Ethiopia. Data from multi-year field experiments and additional data obtained from previously conducted national variety trials were used for model evaluation. Generated weather datasets for six agroecologies were evaluated by comparison with observed data and by use of data in the models. Genetic coefficients used in the models for maize, dry bean and soybean were determined by model parametrization and calibration of phenology and yield. The models acceptably simulated the effects of N rate, maize-legume rotation, and crop residue retention plus tillage with average normalized deviation closer to zero, RMSE less or similar to standard deviation of observed data, and with normalized RMSE (nRMSE) < 15%. Both NASA and Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) daily rainfall showed good agreement with observed weather data (RMSE < 9 mm). Daily maximum and minimum temperature of GYGA and WeatherMan datasets had the lowest RMSE of 1.99 and 3.06, and 2.5 and 3.1 degrees C, respectively. Between 85-100% of simulated grain yields of maize, dry bean and soybean with GYGA and WeatherMan datasets fell within +/- 10% deviation of mean simulated grain yields with observed weather data, and with the lowest inter-annual variability. It was concluded that model calibrations were satisfactory, and either GYGA or WeatherMan datasets alone or combined could be used to run the crop models in sites which lack observed daily weather data in Ethiopia.

VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SP  - 415-424
AB  - Expected global changes in environmental conditions underline the need for a better understanding of genetic variation in ecological traits and their strategies of adaptation to the stresses. In this study, evolutionary mechanisms and processes of UV adaptation in plant pathogens were investigated by combining statistical genetics, physiological assays, and common garden experiment approaches in an assessment of the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, sampled from various geographic locations in China. We found spatial divergence caused by diversifying selection in UV tolerance among P. infestans populations. Local UV radiation was the driving force of selection as indicated by a positive correlation between UV tolerance in P. infestans populations and the altitude of collection sites. Plasticity accounted for 68% of population variation while heritability was negligible, suggesting temporary changes in gene expression and/or enzymatic activity play a more important role than permanent modification of gene structure in the evolution of UV adaptation. This adaptation strategy may explain the lack of fitness penalty observed in genotypes with higher UV tolerance.

VL  - 161

AB  - Specialty grades of stainless steel and other specialty alloys have been designed for virtually every cold heading, forming, upsetting, and extruding operation. They are necessary for the growing number of fastener components that must have the corrosion resistance and strength to withstand harsh environments, high operating temperatures, and great pressures, as well as requirements for special magnetic properties. For all such components, alloy selection has also been governed by the need to reduce part costs and secondary machining operations, thus improving productivity. This article discusses selection guidelines for High Temperature/Specialty Alloys, defines alloy classes, and describes the applications most suitable for each alloy class.

TI  - Mechanisms of bioinvasions by coastal crabs using integrative approaches ? A conceptual review
VL  - 125
SP  - 41-51
AB  - Crustaceans are amongst the most reported invaders of coastal habitats, and predatory brachyuran crabs one of the most successful marine invasive groups. They hold high tolerance to abiotic stress and their genetic, lifehistory, and behavioural adaptation mechanisms prompt their invasive conspicuousness. However, there is a generalized ambiguity on the specific processes that make these bioinvasions successful. No trait-related patterns have yet been found, mostly since traits attributed solely to non-indigenous crab species lack confirmation by comparison with their native counterparts and across each other. Therefore, this review discusses the available literature on fitness and plasticity of brachyuran crabs under global changes, and advances the increasing importance of addressing native versus non-native invasive species comparisons in the annals of brachyura invasion dynamics. Further on, integrative approaches are highlighted and proposed as innovative tools to disentangle trait-related tolerance, overall crab phenotypic plasticity and further adaptation. These indicator tools will advance the knowledge on crabs? invasive potential, which ultimately affects upcoming population dynamics and ecosystem services, adding value to an effective management of coastal bioinvasions.

TI  - Phylosymbiosis Impacts Adaptive Traits in Nasonia Wasps
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
AB  - Phylosymbiosis is defined as microbial community relationships that recapitulate the phylogeny of hosts. As evidence for phylosymbiosis rapidly accumulates in different vertebrate and invertebrate holobionts, a central question is what evolutionary forces cause this pattern. We use intra- and interspecific gut microbiota transplants to test for evidence of selective pressures that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We leverage three closely related species of the parasitoid wasp model Nasonia that recently diverged between 0.4 and 1 million years ago: N. vitripennis, N. giraulti, and N. longicornis. Upon exposure of germfree larvae to heat-inactivated microbiota from intra- or interspecific larvae, we measure larval growth, pupation rate, and adult reproductive capacity. We report three key findings: (i) larval growth significantly slows when hosts receive an interspecific versus intraspecific gut microbiota, (ii) marked decreases in pupation and resulting adult survival occur from interspecific gut microbiota exposure, and (iii) adult reproductive capacities including male fertility and longevity are unaffected by early life exposure to an interspecific microbiota. Overall, these findings reveal developmental and survival costs to Nasonia upon larval exposures to interspecific microbiota and provide evidence that selective pressures on phenotypes produced by host-microbiota interactions may underpin phylosymbiosis.

TI  - Heat shock proteins-driven stress granule dynamics: yet another avenue for cell survival
VL  - 26
IS  - 7
SP  - 371-384
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionary conserved 'stress-response' proteins that facilitate cell survival against various adverse conditions. HSP-mediated cytoprotection was hitherto reported to occur principally in two ways. Firstly, HSPs interact directly or indirectly with apoptosis signaling components and suppress apoptosis. Secondly, through chaperon activity, HSPs suppress proteotoxicity and maintain protein-homeostasis. Recent studies highlight the interaction of HSPs with cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). SGs are conserved cytoplasmic mRNPs granules that aid in cell survival under stressful conditions. We primarily aim to describe the distinct cell survival strategy mediated by HSPs as the crucial regulators of SGs assembly and disassembly. Based on the growing evidence, HSPs and associated co-chaperones act as important determinants of SG assembly, composition and dissolution. Under cellular stress, as a 'stress-coping mechanism', the formation of SGs reprograms protein translation machinery and modulates signaling pathways indispensable for cell survival. Besides their role in suppressing apoptosis, HSPs also regulate protein-homeostasis by their chaperone activity as well as by their tight regulation of SG dynamics. The intricate molecular signaling in and around the nexus of HSPs-SGs and its importance in diseases has to be unearthed. These studies have significant implications in the management of chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases where SGs possess pathological functions.

VL  - 9

SP  - 113-118
AB  - 1. The braconid Asobara tabida is a widespread parasitoid of Drosophila larvae in fermenting substrates. 2. Across its geographic range, survival probability in D. subobscura larvae is high and fairly constant; survival probability in D. melanogaster larvae shows much variation. 3. When females of different strains are offered a choice between larvae of the two host species, the degree of preference for D. subobscura larvae is linked to the difference in survival probability in the two host species. 4. Host selection behaviour of the females matches the predictions made by an optimal foraging model. 5. Survival probability in D. melanogaster also depends on temperature and host selection behaviour appears to be influenced by temperature as well. 6. It is concluded that host selection behaviour of A. tabida is a trait with phenotypic plasticity on top of genetic differences.

TI  - Development and test of a whole-lifetime foraging and bioenergetics growth model for drift-feeding brown trout
VL  - 129
IS  - 2
SP  - 315-332
AB  - We developed and tested a combined foraging and bioenergetics model for predicting growth over the lifetime of drift-feeding brown trout. The foraging component estimates gross energy intake within a fish- and prey size-dependent semicircular foraging area that is perpendicular to the flow, with options for fish feeding across velocity differentials. The bioenergetics component predicts how energy is allocated to growth, reproduction, foraging costs,nd basal metabolism. The model can reveal the degree to which growth is limited by the density and size structure of invertebrate drift within the physiological constraints set by water temperature. We tested the model by predicting growth based on water temperature and on drift density and size structure data from postemergence to age 12, and we compared the predictions with observed size at age as determined from otoliths and scales for a New Zealand river brown trout population. The model produced realistically shaped growth curves in relation to the observed data, accurately predicting mean size at age over the lifetime of the trout, assuming 24-h maximum rations and including diurnal drift-foraging costs (predicted versus observed weight r(2) = 0.94; length r(2) = 0.97). The model predicted that, within a given water-temperature regime, growth is limited primarily by reproduction costs but also by increasing foraging costs as trout grow (a phenomenon that is associated with the increasing foraging time that is required in order to feed to satiation on small invertebrate drift prey). Invertebrate drift size structure significantly influenced predicted growth, especially maximum size, through its effect on foraging time. The model has potential in terms of the exploration of growth-limiting factors and has associated use as an environmental-impact tool and as an aid for hypothesis generation in studies of salmonid growth processes.

TI  - Implementation of an electronic system to monitor the thermoregulatory capacity of honeybee colonies in hives with open-screened bottom boards
VL  - 119
SP  - 209-216
AB  - Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

VL  - 28
IS  - 2
SP  - 114-121
AB  - The thermal preferences of Alaskozetes antarcticus (Acari, Cryptostigmata) and Cryptopygus antarcticus (Collembola, Isotomidae) were investigated over 6 h within a temperature gradient (-3 to +13 degreesC), under 100% relative humidity (RH) conditions. After 10 days of acclimation at -2 or +11 degreesC, individual supercooling points (SCP) and thermopreferences were assessed, and compared with animals maintained for 10 days under fluctuating field conditions (-6 to +7 degreesC). Acclimation at -2 degreesC lowered the mean SCP of both A. antarcticus (-24.2 +/- 9.1) and C. antarcticus (-14.7 +/- 7.7) compared to field samples (-19.0 +/- 9.0 and -10.7 +/- 5.2, respectively). Acclimation at +11 degreesC increased A. antarcticus mean SCP values (-13.0 +/- 8.5) relative to field samples, whereas those of C. antarcticus again decreased (-16.7 +/- 9.1). Mites acclimated under field conditions or at +11 degreesC selected temperatures between -3 and +1 degreesC. After acclimation at -2 degreesC, both species preferred +1 to +5 degreesC. Cryptopygus antarcticus maintained under field conditions preferred +5 to +9 degreesC, whereas individuals acclimated at +11 degreesC selected +9 to +13 degreesC. For A. antarcticus , thermopreference was not influenced by its cold hardened state. The distribution of field specimens was further assessed within two combined temperature and humidity gradient systems: (i) 0-3 degreesC/12% RH, 3-6 degreesC/33% RH, 6-9 degreesC/75% RH and 9-12 degreesC/100% RH and (ii) 0-3 degreesC/100% RH, 3-6 degreesC/75% RH, 6-9 degreesC/33% RH and 9-12 degreesC/12% RH. In gradient (i), C. antarcticus distributed homogeneously, but, in gradient (ii), C. antarcticus preferred 0-3 degreesC/100% RH. Alaskozetes antarcticus selected temperatures between 0 and +6 degreesC regardless of RH conditions. Cryptopygus antarcticus appears better able than A. antarcticus to opportunistically utilize developmentally favourable thermal microclimates, when moisture availability is not restricted. The distribution of A. antarcticus appears more influenced by temperature, especially during regular freeze-thaw transitions, when this species may select low temperature microhabitats to maintain a cold-hardened state.

VL  - 42
IS  - 14
SP  - 5298-5303
AB  - This study is the first one using the Taguchi experimental design to identify the optimal operating condition for reducing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs)formations during the iron ore sintering process. Four operating parameters, including the water content (Wc; range = 6.0-7.0 wt %), suction pressure (Ps; range = 1000-1400 mmH(2)O), bed height (Hb; range = 500-600 mm), and type of hearth layer (including sinter,hemate,and limonite), were selected for conducting experiments in a pilot scale sinter pot to simulate various sintering operating conditions of a real-scale sinter plant. We found that the resultant optimal combination (Wc = 6.5 wt%, Hb = 500 mm, Ps = 1000 mmH(2)O, and hearth layer hematite) could decrease the emission factor of total PCDD/Fs (total EF(PCDD/Fs)) up to 62.8% by reference to the current operating condition of the real-scale sinter plant (Wc 6.5 wt %, Hb = 550 mm, Ps = 1200 mmH(2)O, and hearth layer = sinter). Through the ANOVA analysis, we found that Wc was the most significant parameter in determining total EF(PCDD/Fs) (accounting for 74.7% of the total contribution of the four selected parameters). The resultant optimal combination could also enhance slightly in both sinter productivity and sinter strength (30.3 t/m(2)/day and 72.4%, respectively) by reference to those obtained from the reference operating condition (29.9 t/m (2)/day and 72.2%, respectively). The above results further ensure the applicability of the obtained optimal combination for the real-scale sinter production without interfering its sinter productivity and sinter strength.

VL  - 92
IS  - 6
SP  - 603-609
AB  - Arrhenotokous and thelytokous populations of Thrips tabaci from tobacco or leek plants were evaluated for their ability to transmit Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and for their host preference. Transmission efficiencies were comparatively studied using leaf disks of Petunia hybrida, Datura stramonium, and Nicotiana tabacum cv. Basmas. Adults of arrhenotokous populations collected on infected tobacco plants in the field were efficient transmitters (up to 48.5% transmission) and remained so when maintained on tobacco for several generations. Arrhenotokous T tabaci populations from leek plants were poor transmitters (up to 3.1% transmission), whereas no transmission was obtained with thelytokous populations from leek. All populations could infest leek, however none of the arrhenotokous and thelytokous populations from leek plants was able to infest tobacco. TSWV could be acquired by both first and second larval instars of a T tabaci population from tobacco. However, the transmission by adults decreased with the age at which the virus was acquired by larvae. The highest efficiencies (61% of males and 51% of females transmitted) were obtained when newborn (0- to 24-h old) larvae acquired the virus. The majority of thrips started to transmit after becoming adult and rates were positively correlated with the temperature at which the thrips were kept, The median latent period values found for adults decreased with increasing temperature. The median acquisition access period (AAP(50)) of the population was 41 min, whereas the AAP(50) was 65 min for males and 35 min for females. The median inoculation access period of males was 246 and 365 min on tobacco and petunia, respectively, and 96 and 345 min for females. The results show that T tabaci forms a complex in terms of host preference, reproductive strategy, and ability to transmit TSWV. The transmission parameters show that the thrips of arrhenotokous populations infesting tobacco are highly efficient vectors.

TI  - Increased winter soil temperature variability enhances nitrogen cycling and soil biotic activity in temperate heathland and grassland mesocosms
VL  - 11
IS  - 23
SP  - 7051-7060
AB  - Winter air temperatures are projected to increase in the temperate zone, whereas snow cover is projected to decrease, leading to increased soil temperature variability, and potentially to changes in nutrient cycling. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of increased winter soil temperature variability on selected aspects of the N-cycle in mesocosms containing different plant community compositions. The experiment was replicated at two sites, a colder mountainous upland site with high snow accumulation and a warmer and drier lowland site. Increased soil temperature variability enhanced soil biotic activity for both sites during winter, as indicated by 35% higher nitrogen (N) availability in the soil solution, 40% higher belowground decomposition and a 25% increase in the potential activity of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase. The mobilization of N differed between sites, and the N-15 signal in leaves was reduced by 31% in response to winter warming pulses, but only at the cold site, with significant reductions occurring for three of four tested plant species at this site. Furthermore, there was a trend of increased N leaching in response to the recurrent winter warming pulses. Overall, projected winter climate change in the temperate zone, with less snow and more variable soil temperatures, appears important for shifts in ecosystem functioning (i.e. nutrient cycling). While the effects of warming pulses on plant N mobilization did not differ among sites, reduced plant N-15 incorporation at the colder temperate site suggests that frost damage may reduce plant N uptake in a warmer world, with important implications for nitrogen cycling and nitrogen losses from ecosystems.

Populations of O. a. grahami were resident in pools at 42.8 degrees C and migrated into water reaching temperatures of 44.8 degrees C for short periods. The maximum respiration rates of mitochondria with pyruvate as substrate were 217 and 284natom0 mg(-1) mitochondrial proteinmin-l at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, respectively (Q(10) = 1.71). Fatty acyl carnitines (chain lengths C8, C12 and C16), malate and glutamate were oxidised at 70-80 % of the rate for pyruvate. In order to assess evolutionary temperature adaptation of maximum mitochondrial oxidative capacities, the rates of pyruvate and palmitoyl carnitine utilisation in red muscle mitochondria were measured from species living at other temperatures: Notothenia coriiceps from Antarctica(-1.5 to +1 degrees C); summer-caught Myoxocephalus scorpius from the North Sea (10-15 degrees C); and Oreochromis andersoni from African lakes and rivers (22-30 degrees C). State 3 respiration rates had Q(10) values in the range 1.8-2.7. At the lower lethal temperature of O. andersoni (12.5 degrees C), isolated mitochondria utilised pyruvate at a similar rate to mitochondria from N. coriiceps at 2.5 degrees C (30 natom O mg(-1) mitochondrial protein min(-1)). Rates of pyruvate oxidation by mitochondria from M. scorpius and N. coriiceps were similar and were higher at a given temperature than far O. andersoni. At their normal body temperature (-1.2 degrees C), mitochondria from the Antarctic fish oxidised pyruvate at 5.5% and palmitoyl-DL-carnitine at 8.8% of the rates of mitochondria from the hot-spring species at 42 degrees C. The results indicate only modest evolutionary adjustments in the maximal rates of mitochondrial respiration in fish living at different temperatures.

TI  - Preliminary study on lean premixed combustion of ammonia-hydrogen for swirling gas turbine combustors
VL  - 42
IS  - 38
SP  - 24495-24503
AB  - Hydrogen has been considered one of the most promising materials for energy storage during the last decade with considerable research having been undertaken to demonstrate the use of the molecule in power production systems. However, hydrogen presents drawbacks in terms of global commercialisation and deployment since its distribution is only feasible with significant dedicated infrastructure investment including liquefaction or if it is combined with other gases such as methane. The latter will still produce carbon emissions, whilst the former is not economically viable with current technologies. Therefore, an alternative is to use ammonia as a hydrogen storage vector. Ammonia, a molecule that has been used for more than a century, is a well-known material distributed across the world. Moreover, its properties allow its liquefaction at a relatively low pressure under atmospheric temperature compared to hydrogen, serving as a compound that can be used from fertilising to industrial processes. For power generation, ammonia has demonstrated to have a very slow reaction hence flame speeds, thus one option is to dope the fuel with a more reactive molecule such as hydrogen, which conveniently can be obtained from cracking ammonia. Hence, this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental campaign where a 50:50 (vol%) ammonia-hydrogen blend was used for lean premixed combustion in a generic swirl combustor used in gas turbine studies. The results show that whilst the mixture can produce a good flame velocity similar to methane with the mixture having near equivalent laminar flame speed characteristics, the high diffusivity of hydrogen under these conditions leads to a narrow operational envelope with the potential for boundary layer flashback. High NO. emissions are produced due to the excess production of OH and O radicals. Recommendations for further studies and future developments are also discussed.

TI  - A Pilot Plant Study on the Autoclaving of Food Wastes for Resource Recovery and Reutilization
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - Autoclaving of food wastes (FW) for the resource recovery and reutilization was studied using the pilot plant scale. Experiments were conducted at various temperatures of 408, 428, and 438 K and times of 15 and 60 min. The in-filled steam to the autoclave was supplied by the incineration plant with a gauge pressure of 7 kg/cm(2) and a temperature of 443 K or above. The results obtained from the experiments show that the less energy- and time-consuming autoclaving conditions (408 K and 15 min, denoted as Case A408-15) are effective. Comparisons of the properties and characteristics of autoclaved FW (FWA) of Case A408-15 with those of FW are made. The wet bulk volume and wet bulk density of FW (A) are dramatically reduced to 15.64% and increased to 313.37% relative to those of FW, respectively. This makes the subsequent processing and reuse for FWA more convenient than FW. The autoclaving results in an increase of carbon content and a decrease of nitrogen content, and thus an increase of the C/N ratio of FWA. The contents of sulfur, hemi-cellulose, and cellulose of FWA are also reduced. All these fluctuations are beneficial for making compost or other usages from FWA than FW. The autoclaved liquid product (LA) separated from FWA and liquid condensate (LC) from the released gas possess high COD and TOC. These two liquids can be mixed for use as liquid fertilizers with proper conditioning. Alternatively, further anaerobic digestion of the mixture of FWA, LA, and LC can offer enhanced biogas production for power generation. All these thus match the appeal of sustainable materials management and circular economy. The emitted gas from autoclaving contains no CO and some hydrocarbons. Suitable air pollution control is needed. The results and information obtained are useful for the proper recovery and reuse of abundant food wastes from domestic households and food industries.

VL  - 49

SP  - 2273-2280
AB  - The results support the hypothesis that the commencement of smolting can occur during the decreasing phase of the annual photoperiod cycle, and sexual maturation during the increasing phase of the cycle, provided individuals have attained certain (unknown) growth thresholds. Thereafter the completion of smolting is entrained by the increasing phase of the photoperiod cycle, and sexual maturation by the decreasing phase. Three groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were raised in freshwater for over 2 yr from the eyed egg stage under photoperiod cycles of either 6-, 12- (control), or 18-mo periodicity and an ambient 12-mo temperature cycle. Smolting was judged by changes in salinity tolerance and condition factor. All groups developed bimodal length-frequency distributions by December following hatch. Fish continued to be recruited into the upper modal group (UMG) beyond the shortest day of the photoperiod cycle, providing temperature was not limiting growth. The 6-, 1 2-, and 18-mo photoperiod cycles resulted in approximately 50, 60, and 100% of the populations being recruited into the UMG. Sexually mature male parr (1 + yr old) occurred only in the lower modal group of the 6- and 12-mo groups.

VL  - 102

SP  - 3933-3938
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are often preserved as starter cultures by freezing to extend shelf stability as well as maintain cell viability and acidification activity. Previous studies showed that the endocyte extracted from gradient-freezing pretreated cells could act as lyoprotectant in the lyophilization process of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of L. lactis in response to gradient freezing exposure are described using high-throughput sequencing. Nineteen of 56 genes were upregulated after gradient freezing, whereas 37 genes were downregulated. Further validation results of quantitative real-time PCR experiments were consistent with the RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathway were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes. Several pathways, such as glutathione metabolism, ATP-binding cassette transport, metabolism of cell wall and cell membrane components, and stress response-related pathways, were affected by gradient freezing. Six genes relevant to freezing stress response were selected for quantitative real-time PCR, including 3 upregulated genes (hisK, eutD, dukA) and 3 downregulated genes (als, yedF, pepN). The Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed these genes may influence stress response-related pathways, improving the survival of the L. lactis under freezing stress. The identification of these genes deepened an understanding about their response under freezing stress, helping us find potential genes or pathways related to gradient freezing for further research on lyoprotectants.

VL  - 12

SP  - 1487-1502
AB  - Standing genetic variation represents a genetic load on population fitness but can also support a rapid response to short-term environmental change, and the greatest potential source of such standing genetic variation typically exists among locally adapted populations living along an environmental gradient. Here, we develop a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify the contribution of existing genetic variation arising from migration-mutation-selection-drift balance to time to extinction under environmental change. Simulations reveal that local adaptation across a species range associated with an underlying environmental gradient could extend time to extinction by nearly threefold irrespective of the rate of environmental change. The potential for preadapted alleles to increase the rate of adaptation changes the relative importance of established extinction risk factors; in particular, it reduced the importance of the breadth of environmental tolerance and it increased the relative importance of fecundity. Although migration of preadapted alleles generally increased persistence time, it decreased it at rates of environmental change close to the critical rate of change by creating a population bottleneck, which ultimately limited the rate at which de novo mutations could arise. An analysis of the extinction dynamics further revealed that one consequence of gene flow is the potential to maximize population growth rate in at least part of the species range, which is likely to have consequences for forecasting the consequences of ecological interactions. Our study shows that predictions of persistence time change fundamentally when existing local adaptations are explicitly taken into account, underscoring the need to preserve and manage genetic diversity.

TI  - Anthropogenic and natural barriers affect genetic connectivity in an Alpine butterfly
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
SP  - 114-130
AB  - Dispersal is a key biological process serving several functions including connectivity among populations. Habitat fragmentation caused by natural or anthropogenic structures may hamper dispersal, thereby disrupting genetic connectivity. Investigating factors affecting dispersal and gene flow is important in the current era of anthropogenic global change, as dispersal comprises a vital part of a species' resilience to environmental change. Using finescale landscape genomics, we investigated gene flow and genetic structure of the Sooty Copper butterfly (Lycaena tityrus) in the Alpine otz valley system in Austria. We found surprisingly high levels of gene flow in L. tityrus across the region. Nevertheless, ravines, forests, and roads had effects on genetic structure, while rivers did not. The latter is surprising as roads and rivers have a similar width and run largely in parallel in our study area, pointing towards a higher impact of anthropogenic compared with natural linear structures. Additionally, we detected eleven loci potentially under thermal selection, including ones related to membranes, metabolism, and immune function. This study demonstrates the usefulness of molecular approaches in obtaining estimates of dispersal and population processes in the wild. Our results suggest that, despite high gene flow in the Alpine valley system investigated, L. tityrus nevertheless seems to be vulnerable to anthropogenically-driven habitat fragmentation. With anthropogenic rather than natural linear structures affecting gene flow, this may have important consequences for the persistence of species such as the butterfly studied here in altered landscapes.

VL  - 14

SP  - 22252-22262
AB  - A gate-tunable synaptic device controlling dynamically reconfigurable excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses, which can emulate the fundamental synaptic responses for developing diverse functionalities of the biological nervous system, was developed using ambipolar oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs). Since the balanced ambipolarity is significant, a boron-incorporated SnO (SnO:B) oxide semiconductor channel was newly developed to improve the ambipolar charge transports by reducing the subgap defect density, which was reduced to less than 10(17) cm(-3). The ambipolar SnO:B-TFT could be fabricated with a good reproductivity at the maximum process temperature of 250 degrees C and exhibited good TFT performances, such as a nearly zero switching voltage, the saturation mobility of similar to 1.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), s-value of similar to 1.1 V decade(-1), and an on/off-current ratio of similar to 8 x 10(3) for the p-channel mode, while similar to 0.14 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to 2.2 V decade(-1) and similar to 1 x 10(3) for n-channel modes, respectively. The ambipolar device imitated potentiation/depression behaviors in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses by using the p- and n-channel transports by tuning a gate bias. The low-power consumptions of <20 and <2 nJ per pulse for the excitatory and inhibitory operations, respectively, were also achieved. The presented device operated under an ambient atmosphere and confirmed a good operation reliability over 5000 pulses and a long-term air environmental stability. The study presents the high potential of an ambipolar oxide-TFT-based synaptic device with a good manufacturability to develop emerging neuromorphic perception and computing hardware for next-generation artificial intelligence systems.

VL  - 48
IS  - 4
SP  - 911-922
AB  - The ability of Paederus beetles to resist desiccation stress is vital to their adaptability in various ecological niches. How water relations and their response to desiccation vary among adult beetles of different age, sex, and mating status is unclear. We examined the water relations of adult Paederus fuscipes Curtis and the mechanisms used to reduce desiccation stress. One-day-old beetles had an exceptionally high percent total body water (%TBW) content and tolerated a high level of %TBW loss. Newly emerged beetles contained a high level of trehalose and 40 to 60% lipid content of their total dry mass, which allowed them to endure desiccation. Beetles that were 10 wk old and older exhibited reduced cuticular permeability. Glucose, glycogen, and lipid contents were crucial throughout most of the adult life span, as they helped compensate for water loss via increased water vapor absorption and metabolic water. In particular, the accumulation of lipid after mating was significant and may further confer tolerance to water loss. The effect of melanization on the desiccation tolerance of beetles was not significant. Females had better tolerance in response to desiccation stress compared with males. We suggest that the observed differences between sexes likely were a function of water relations and an effect of energy metabolite reserves. However, the mortality of females at 24-h postdesiccating stage was marginally significant compared with males.These results demonstrate that P. fuscipes adults prevent dehydration using multiple mechanisms that collectively reduce desiccation stress and increase dehydration tolerance.

AB  - An increase in resistance to one natural enemy may result in no correlated change, a positive correlated change, or a negative correlated change in the ability of the host or prey to resist other natural enemies. The type of specificity is important in understanding the evolutionary response to natural enemies and was studied here in a Drosaphila-parasitoid system. Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased larval resistance to the endoparasitoid wasps Asobara tabida or Leptopilina boulardi were exposed to attack by A. tabida, L. boulardi and Leptopilina heterotama at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. In general, encapsulation ability increased with temperature, with the exception of the lines selected against L. boulardi, which showed the opposite trend. Lines selected against L, boulardi showed large increases in resistance against all three parasitoid species, and showed similar levels of defense against A. tabida to the lines selected against that parasitoid. In contrast, lines selected against A. tabida showed a large increase in resistance to A. tabida and generally to L. heterotoma, but displayed only a small change in their ability to survive attack by L. boulardi. Such asymmetries in correlated responses to selection for increased resistance to natural enemies may influence host-parasitoid community structure.

TI  - Dynamic sustainability assessment of heat and electricity production based on agricultural crop residues in Denmark
VL  - 213
SP  - 491-507
AB  - Bioenergy use is expected to increase significantly to support energy strategies and to meet climate targets in a large number of countries. Agricultural residues as an energy resource have attracted a lot of interest, as the use of residue biomass is perceived as beneficial to mitigate greenhouse gas emission and to be less harmful to the environment than other biomass resources. Here we present a holistic sustainability assessment of the use of cereal straw for heat and electricity production in Denmark. The assessment applies a methodology and framework developed by the Global Bioenergy Partnership. Sixteen sustainability indicators within the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are quantified or assessed qualitatively together with their development over time from year 2000-2014/2015. The assessment points to a number of benefits of straw based bioenergy as reductions in GHG emissions, income generation and jobs for a rural population, reduced use of fossil fuels and increased diversity of the national energy supply. These benefits come at a risk of soil degradation and soil organic matter mining, of increased emissions of non-greenhouse gases. The assessment shows that land allocation to straw harvest for energy has increased over time together with land productivity. The diversity of the national energy supply has increased over time just as the infrastructure required to support straw to energy supply chains. Ecologically there is a potential for further use of agricultural residue biomass for energy. To realise the potential sustainably, attention should be put on developing guidelines or regulation on biomass harvest, on avoidance of environmental burden shifting, on logistics and efficient conversion to energy services, and on maintaining a suitable organisational and policy framework. The framework of the Global Bioenergy Partnership proved to be a versatile tool for the assessment of bioenergy sustainability, also in a developed country. It is, however, relying on specific data sources and formats, which in many cases are not readily available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 25

SP  - 538-547
AB  - Purpose California is the largest US producer of processing tomatoes, generating 96% of all domestic production and nearly 30% of global supply. Processing tomatoes are mostly processed into diced and paste products. Consumers and actors along their supply chains are increasingly interested in understanding their environmental burdens and identifying opportunities for improvements. This study applies life cycle assessment (LCA) to California diced and paste products over a 10-year timeframe to characterize current impacts and historical trends. Methods The LCA considers a scope from cradle-to-processing facility gate and accords with relevant Product Category Rules as published by the International EPD (R) System. Extensive primary data were collected for tomato cultivation for the years 2005 and 2015, and from processing facilities for 2005, 2010, and 2015 to understand the effects of evolving practices and technologies. We estimate crop and regional specific nitrous oxide and nitrate leaching emissions using a biogeochemical model, and the USES-LCA model is used to determine potential impacts from pesticide application. A suite of impact assessment categories is included based on the CML method (only global warming potential and freshwater consumption values are in the abstract). Results and discussion The 2015 results of the study indicate that diced tomatoes are responsible for 0.16 kg CO(2)e and 71 L of freshwater per kg, and paste is responsible for 0.83 kg CO(2)e and 328 L of freshwater per kg. The main opportunities for improvement include natural gas use in the greenhouse phase, energy for irrigation pumping and fertilizer type in the cultivation phase, and natural gas and electricity use in the facility processing phase. These hotspots are consistent with studies of processing tomato in other parts of the world. Evaluating trends over time showed that technological improvements in the industry had reduced life cycle impacts; for example, global warming potential decreased by 12% for paste and 26% for diced products between 2005 and 2015. Conclusions Trends over time show increasing efficiency at the cultivation and processing facility stages that have led to reductions in all impact categories evaluated. However, additional opportunities exist beyond efficiency improvements. Fertilizer and pesticide choice are potential opportunities for further reducing impacts. Also, the introduction of renewables in each phase of the supply chain (solar-powered irrigation pumps and onsite solar energy generation for facilities) could reduce the overall supply chain GWP(100) impacts by 9-10%.

TI  - Temporally Autocorrelated Environmental Fluctuations Inhibit the Evolution of Stress Tolerance
VL  - 191
IS  - 6
SP  - E195-E207
AB  - As global environmental conditions continue to change at an unprecedented rate, many species will experience increases in natural and anthropogenic stress. Generally speaking, selection is expected to favor adaptations that reduce the negative impact of environmental stress (i.e., stress tolerance). However, natural environmental variables typically fluctuate, exhibiting various degrees of temporal autocorrelation, known as environmental colors, which may complicate evolutionary responses to stress. Here we combine experiments and theory to show that temporal environmental autocorrelation can determine long-term evolutionary responses to stress without affecting the total amount of stress experienced over time. Experimental evolution of RNA virus lineages in differing environmental autocorrelation treatments agreed closely with predictions from our theoretical models that stress tolerance is favored in less autocorrelated (whiter) environments but disfavored in more autocorrelated (redder) environments. This is explained by an interaction between environmental autocorrelation and a phenotypic trade-off between stress tolerance and reproductive ability. The degree to which environmental autocorrelation influences evolutionary trajectories depends on the shape of this trade-off as well as the relative level of tolerance exhibited by novel mutants. These results suggest that long-term evolutionary dynamics depend not only on the overall strength of selection but also on the way that selection is distributed over time.

TI  - Higher susceptibility of beech to drought in comparison to oak
VL  - 64
AB  - The expected increase in drought severity and frequency as a result of anthropogenic climate change leads to concerns about the ability of native tree species to cope with these changes. To determine the susceptibility of Fagus sylvatica (European beech) and Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) - the two dominant deciduous tree species in Central Europe - to drought, we quantified the climate sensitivity and drought-response of radial growth for both species using an array of dendroecological methods. Tree-ring data were collected from a site east of Coburg, Bavaria which had shown pronounced stress-symptoms (early leaf coloration) during the record drought of 2018. Climate-growth relationships were used to establish the sensitivity of radial growth to multiple climatic variables. The impact of specific drought events on tree growth was quantified using tolerance indices. In addition, we employed a Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) and remote sensing data (MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) to delineate the species specific drought responses. Using these methods we were able to show a clear difference in drought susceptibility between beech and oak. Beech dis played a higher sensitivity to temperature and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and showed lower resistance and resilience to drought events than oak. In particular, beech was unable to fully recover from the 2003 drought, after which it expressed a stark growth decline, i.e. drought legacies, which was not observed for oak. The PCGA revealed a clear differentiation in the grouping of drought responses between beech and oak, supporting the findings of the climate-growth analysis and the tolerance indices. Correlations of NDVI and ring-width indices (RWI) indicated that under normal climatic conditions NDVI variability is linked to the start of the growing season. This is in contrast to drought years, such as 2003, where summer NDVI mirrored the drought response of beech and oak. These results reveal beech to have both a higher sensitivity to summer temperature and SPEI and a higher susceptibility to drought events. Although, in the past high plasticity and adaptability to drought have been attributed to both beech and oak, our study assigns beech a higher risk than oak to suffer from anticipated increases in drought frequency and intensity as a consequence of climate change.

TI  - Salinity tolerance of the larvae and first juveniles of a semiterrestrial grapsid crab, Armases miersii (Rathbun)
VL  - 202
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-223
AB  - The tropical crab Armases miersii breeds in supratidal rock pools, where great salinity variations occur. In laboratory experiments, all larval stages (zoea I-III, megalopa) and the first juvenile were studied as to their tolerance of acute salinity changes (5-55 parts per thousand, intervals of 10 parts per thousand) after preceding adaptation to ambient sea water (32-33 parts per thousand). Our observations suggest that some osmoregulatory capability exists from hatching. Survival was frequently higher and development faster at 15-25 parts per thousand than in sea water (35 parts per thousand), possibly indicating a phylogenetic adaptation of A. miersii to brackish water. Extremely low and high salinities (5, 45-55 parts per thousand) caused prolonged development durations and increased mortality rates. Tolerance of very low salinity, but not that of hypersaline conditions tended to increase during development. This suggests that late stages attain an increasing capability for hyper-osmoregulation in dilute media, but probably remain poor regulators in concentrated media. The megalopa and crab I were, in some experiments, less affected by chronic than by acute exposure to unfavourable salinities, suggesting that non-genetic resistance adaptation (acclimatization) had taken place during earlier development. During continual exposure to extreme salinities, however, effects of severe osmotic stress outweighed those of acclimatization. The range which allowed for successful development through metamorphosis widened with consecutively later change of salinity: 15-35 parts per thousand (exposure from hatching), 15-45 parts per thousand (from zoea II), 5-45 parts per thousand (from zoea III), 5-55 parts per thousand (from megalopa or crab I). It is concluded that tolerance of variable, predominantly low salinities in larval and early juvenile A. miersii has evolved as an adaptation to breeding in a physically unstable environment, where rapidly decreasing or continually low salinities are more likely to occur than hypersaline conditions. The degree of salinity tolerance in its early life-cycle stages shows that this species has reached, within the Grapsidae, a phylogenetically intermediate stage of adaptation to conditions in freshwater and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Dynamic modelling and simulation of IGCC process with Texaco gasifier using different coal
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 198-210
AB  - Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is considered as a viable option for low emission power generation and carbon dioxide sequestration. As a part of the process of IGCC plant design and development, modelling and simulation study of the whole IGCC process is important for thermodynamic performance evaluation, study of carbon capture readiness and economic analysis. The work presented in the paper is to develop such a whole system model and simulation platform. A simplified dynamic model for the IGCC process is developed, in which Texaco gasifier is chosen to give the basic representation for the IGCC process. The chemical equilibriums principle is used to predict the syngas contents in the modelling procedure. The influences of key parameters to regulate the input such as oxygen/coal ratio and water/coal ratio to syngas generation are studied. The simulation results are validated by comparing with the industry data provided by the Lu-nan fertilizer factory. Water-shift reactor, gas turbine and heat recovery steam-generation modules are modelled to study the dynamic performance with respect to the variation from the input of syngas stream. The simulation results reveal the dynamic changes in the plant outputs, including gas temperature, power output and mole percentages of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the syngas. The process dynamic responses with three types of coal inputs are studied in the paper and their dynamic variation trends are presented via the simulation results.

TI  - Stormwater Management: Myths, Measurements and Models
SP  - 1-12
AB  - The urban environs are a complex constructed interface that significantly alters rainfall-runoff relationships, and through the generation of anthropogenic and biogenic constituents results in significant transport of chemical, thermal, microbiological and. particulate matter (PM) loads. These loads are largely coupled with the altered rainfall-runoff relationship. In North American cities with municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) the load of volumetric runoff, chemicals and PM are equal to or greater than the untreated influent loads to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) yet the management of urban runoff loads is at least a half century behind municipal wastewater management yet is greater in scale and cost. Urban runoff management is very challenging; in part due to PM hetero-dispersivity, interactions between aqueous and PM phases, stochastic hydrology and highly unsteady hydrodynamics. Such challenges and associated costs with resolving such challenges have led to the relatively common historical. examination of a spectrum of urban constituent control systems as black-box systems and rainfall-runoff chemistry utilizing lumped measurements; and many indices and measurement methods adopted from wastewater treatment. Experience over the last several decades has demonstrated that there continues to be a gap in knowledge transfer between the design, analysis and monitoring of what are nominally called "Best Management Practices" (BMPs), fundamental unit operations and processes (UOP) concepts, sustainability requirements for BMPs, as well as new developments in the behavior of green urban infrastructure. Despite such disparity, tools such as UOP concepts, monitoring tools such as laser diffraction, and continuous simulation modeling are removing stormwater controls from the category of "black-boxes". With such tools we can now demonstrate treatment viability as a function of the hydrologic, physical, chemical, biological and thermal phenomena for rainfall-runoff or snowmelt. Stormwater systems that do not provide some level of hydrologic restoration, for example through "green" infrastructure materials; are not sustainable. Additionally given the particulate matter, gross solids and pollutant load inventories that build up in urban areas, source control practices and load credits must be an integral part of any management plan that includes restoration, treatment, control and reuse. Stormwater treatment, urban maintenance and green infrastructure will play an increasingly critical role in the entire urban water cycle and therefore we must develop maintenance practices such as pavement cleaning, source control and near-Source control. Further advances with respect to sustainability of urban water require tools such as continuous simulation models, smart sensors and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a focus on fundamental UOP concepts. This,paper examines the role of our constructed environs and activities therein on-the urban water cycle and coupled delivery of constituent loads that impact the environment and ecology including human ecology. This paper examines these constituent loads fundamentally and recommends management tools such as continuous simulation of hydrologic restoration to restore sustainability of the urban water cycle. Results illustrate the current practice of MS4s with thousands of BMPs is not sustainable. The future will require these advanced management tools, centralized treatment and frequent maintenance practices. Sustainability will ultimately require source control of loads, green infrastructure and hydrologic restoration. An emerging challenge in North America is the use of reclaimed wastewater back onto the urban interface with commensurate volumetric benefits yet chemical legacy concerns. State of the art tools, specifically computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are introduced to illustrate the role of CFD in examining treatment of urban water.

TI  - Temporal patterns in adult salmon migration timing across southeast Alaska
VL  - 21
IS  - 5
SP  - 1821-1833
AB  - Pacific salmon migration timing can drive population productivity, ecosystem dynamics, and human harvest. Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.

VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 136-146
AB  - Hylobius abietis develop in conifer root-stumps and emerging adults attack replanted trees. Development is largely semi-voltine and this is an important determinant of economic impact, influencing the length of a fallow period or the frequency of chemical control. A simulation model followed a generation of weevils through the life cycle to predict voltinism based on temperature in the root-stump microhabitat modelled from air temperature. Daily air temperatures for representative U.K. locations simulated from the U.K. Climate Projections 2009 Weather Generator for the 2030-2070s were used to predict the potential effect of climate change on voltinism. The life cycle currently takes 2-3 years in the north and west (N&W) of the U.K. but, in the south and east (S&E), a 2-year cycle predominates. From the 2030s onwards, a predominant 2-year life cycle in the N&W was predicted to reduce economic impact in this region. In the S&E, however, the predicted 1-2-year cycle would be unlikely to reduced the period over which pest management was required. Changes in voltinism to the 2070s revealed different temporal patterns, emphasizing the importance for management of modelling local, as well as regional scale variation in the effects of climate change in Europe.

TI  - The Horizon-AGN simulation: evolution of galaxy properties over cosmic time
VL  - 467

SP  - 4739-4752
AB  - We compare the predictions of Horizon-AGN, a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation that uses an adaptive mesh refinement code, to observational data in the redshift range 0 < z < 6. We study the reproduction, by the simulation, of quantities that trace the aggregate stellar-mass growth of galaxies over cosmic time: luminosity and stellar-mass functions, the star formation main sequence, rest-frame UV-optical-near-infrared colours and the cosmic star formation history. We show that Horizon-AGN, which is not tuned to reproduce the local Universe, produces good overall agreement with these quantities, from the present day to the epoch when the Universe was 5 per cent of its current age. By comparison to Horizon-noAGN, a twin simulation without active galactic nuclei feedback, we quantify how feedback from black holes is likely to help shape galaxy stellar-mass growth in the redshift range 0 < z < 6, particularly in the most massive galaxies. Our results demonstrate that Horizon-AGN successfully captures the evolutionary trends of observed galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe, making it an excellent tool for studying the processes that drive galaxy evolution and making predictions for the next generation of galaxy surveys.

TI  - Incorporating Uncertainty in Predicting the Future Response of Coral Reefs to Climate Change
VL  - 46
SP  - 281-303
AB  - Coral reefs are considered one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to ongoing global climate change. However, geographic and taxonomic responses to climate change are highly variable, and fundamental aspects of key research approaches remain unresolved, leaving substantial uncertainty in our ability to predict the future of coral reefs. I review the ecological and evolutionary. response of coral reefs to climate change in a broad temporal context, primarily focusing on tropical reef corals. I show critical gaps in our understanding that impede accurate prediction of future responses. These gaps include the response of past reefs to global change, the interpretation of coral response to thermal stress and ocean acidification, how corals and other reef organisms might respond evolutionarily, and our approach to evaluating response to climate in the context of multiple stressors. Reducing uncertainty by filling these gaps and by incorporating variation in geographic and taxonomic response will substantially improve our ability to model coral reef futures and manage coral reefs.

TI  - Survival of Ancient Landforms in a Collisional Setting as Revealed by Combined Fission Track and (U-Th)/He Thermochronometry: A Case Study from Corsica (France)
VL  - 120
IS  - 2
SP  - 155-173
AB  - The age of high-elevation planation surfaces in Corsica is constrained using new apatite (U-Th)/He data, field observations, and published work (zircon fission track, apatite fission track [AFT] data and landform/stratigraphical analysis). Thermal modeling results based on AFT and (U-Th)/He data, and the Eocene sediments uncomformably overlapping the Variscan crystalline basement indicate that present-day elevated planation surfaces in Corsica are the remnants of an erosion surface formed on the basement between similar to 120 and similar to 60 Ma. During the Alpine collision in the Paleocene-Eocene, the Variscan crystalline basement was buried beneath a westward-thinning wedge of flysch, and the eastern portion was overridden by the Alpine nappes. Resetting of the apatite fission track thermochronometer suggests an overburden thickness of >4 km covering Variscan Corsica. Protected by soft sediment, the planation surface was preserved. In the latest Oligocene to Miocene times, the surface was re-exposed and offset by reactivated faults, with individual basement blocks differentially uplifted in several phases to elevations of, in some cases, 12 km. Currently the planation surface remnants occur at different altitudes and with variable tilt. This Corsican example demonstrates that under favorable conditions, paleolandforms typical of tectonically inactive areas can survive in tectonically active settings such as at collisional plate margins. The results of some samples also reveal some discrepancies in thermal histories modeled from combined AFT and (U-Th)/He data. In some cases, models could not find a cooling path that fit both data sets, while in other instances, the modeled cooling paths suggest isothermal holding at temperature levels just below the apatite partial annealing zone followed by final late Neogene cooling. This result appears to be an artifact of the modeling algorithm as it is in conflict with independent geological constraints. Caution should be used when cross-validating the AFT and (U-Th)/He systems both in the case extremely old terrains and in the case of rocks with a relatively simple, young cooling history.

TI  - Microclimate and resource quality determine resource use in a range-expanding herbivore
VL  - 17
IS  - 8
AB  - The consequences of climate change for biogeographic range dynamics depend on the spatial scales at which climate influences focal species directly and indirectly via biotic interactions. An overlooked question concerns the extent to which microclimates modify specialist biotic interactions, with emergent properties for communities and range dynamics. Here, we use an in-field experiment to assess egg-laying behaviour of a range-expanding herbivore across a range of natural microclimatic conditions. We show that variation in microclimate, resource condition and individual fecundity can generate differences in egg-laying rates of almost two orders of magnitude in an exemplar species, the brown argus butterfly (Aricia agestis). This within-site variation in fecundity dwarfs variation resulting from differences in average ambient temperatures among populations. Although higher temperatures did not reduce female selection for host plants in good condition, the thermal sensitivities of egg-laying behaviours have the potential to accelerate climate-driven range expansion by increasing egg-laying encounters with novel hosts in increasingly suitable microclimates. Understanding the sensitivity of specialist biotic interactions to microclimatic variation is, therefore, critical to predict the outcomes of climate change across species' geographical ranges, and the resilience of ecological communities.

VL  - 183
SP  - 111-128
AB  - Spatio-temporally continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is a valuable input for many research fields such as environmental studies and hydrological models. Substantial efforts have been focused on mapping daily SAT using land surface temperature (LST) derived from polar-orbiting satellites such as NASA's Terra and Aqua. However, reconstruction of SAT at very high temporal scales such as sub-daily or hourly was carried out in very few studies, most of which are based on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites for small-scale areas with limited stations. In this study, we developed estimation schemes based on random forest for mapping hourly SAT over a large-scale region (CONUS) by blending LST datasets from the two-satellite system of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series with the aim of reconstructing the hourly SAT maps with spatially uniform resolutions of about 2 km over CONUS. Estimation schemes with different variables were compared to evaluate the contributions of reanalysis variables and the hour of day (HOD) variable to model predicative performance, and the impacts of station density on model performance were also explored. We found that the model scheme with reanalysis variables and the scheme with HOD achieved higher predicative performance with the mean RMSE of 2.0 K and 2.5 K, respectively. Systematic predictive errors across the synoptic hours of a diurnal cycle are significantly reduced when considering HOD in the modeling of hourly SAT. The model scheme considering both reanalysis variables and HOD achieved the highest performance with a mean RMSE of 1.9 K. We observed that the influence of station density on model performance is related to types of cross-validation and model schemes, and that the uncertainty levels associated with the evaluation of predicative performance for the model schemes decrease with station density, which increases our confidence in the evaluation results for the schemes. Therefore, the mapping accuracy of hourly SAT over the large-scale area CONUS could be conservatively estimated to be 1.9-2.5 K using site-based cross-validation. We expect that this study will facilitate the further mapping of SAT at high-temporal scales over large-scale areas based on abundant and sustained observations from global systems of meteorological geostationary satellites.

TI  - Chemo-immunotherapy of colorectal carcinoma: preclinical rationale and clinical experience
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 99-110
AB  - Advanced colorectal cancer is a common disease with an high mortality rate. For four decades, pharmacological treatment of the advanced disease was based on the use of 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with biomodulators such as folinic acid and intereferon alpha. In the last 5 years, response to therapy has been considerably ameliorated thanks to the discovery of new drugs such as oxaliplatin and CPT-11. These agents, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, according to various schedules of treatment, have reached a significant improvement of palliation, response rate and survival. Immunotherapy is an uprising modality of treatment for human cancer including colorectal carcinoma. Its rationale is based on the knowledge that tumour cells are genetically unstable and produce molecular structures which allow their recognition and destruction by the immune-surveillance system. Therefore, humoral as well as cellular compartments of the immune system can be utilized according to a "passive" strategy (e.g. monoclonal antibody administration and adoptive immunotherapy) or an "active" approach, by using different modalities of vaccine therapy. In this context, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and cancer vaccines are being tested for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Due to their genetic instability and extraordinary adaptative potential, tumour cells may acquire resistance to the immune effectors and mAbs exactly as they do for cytotoxic drugs. To improve the results of both immunological and chemical modality of cancer treatment, an increasing number of authors is starting to combine chemo and immunotherapy in the attempt to circumvent the limitations of both strategies.

TI  - Artificial wetlands as a solution to the decline in the frog population: Estimation of their suitability through the study of population dynamics of Sahara Frogs in hill lakes
VL  - 63
SP  - 114-121
AB  - Amphibians are in decline principally due to the reduction of wetlands, yet no studies of their population trends have been published. Survival rates in the different stages of frog life may be considered as indicators of population dynamics and habitat suitability, thus permitting evaluation of the efficiency of newly constructed wetlands. Sessions of mark-release-recapture of tadpoles, froglets and adults of the Sahara Frog (Pelophylax saharicus) were thus undertaken in four Tunisian hill lakes over a two-year period (three months per year), to estimate efficiency rates between stages. No difference in tadpole densities was detected between lakes and years, though froglet densities in two of the lakes were always higher than in the other two. Similarly, adult densities were higher in the first two lakes. In August, survival between eggs and tadpoles ranged from 1.9 to 4.7%, in September, between tadpoles and froglets, from 14.8 to 28.5%, and between froglets and subadults (one year old) from 16.4 to 18.8%. Survival from the egg to the subadult stage therefore ranged from 0.7 to 1.3%.. These results show that the creation of small hill lakes provides for stable and structured populations of the Sahara Frog and that the smaller lakes are more favourable than the larger ones, in relation with a shore effect proportionally higher due to vegetation. These artificial wetlands increase the number of suitable habitats for pond-spawning species (frogs, toads), provide good compensation for the reduction of natural wetlands and may be adopted by managers as a new function (species conservation) for hill lakes.

VL  - 68
SP  - 289-297
AB  - The role of high temperature resistance in the world-wide cline of Adh and alpha-Gpdh allele frequencies of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. Experimental strains were used with different combinations of Adh and alpha-Gpdh alleles but with similar genetic background. The survival time of adult males, reared at different pre-adult temperatures, was measured at 35-degrees-C. To investigate the relationship between survival and protein content, triglycerides content and ADH and alpha-GPDH enzyme activity, the latter characters were measured before and after 12 h exposure to 35-degrees-C. Three-way ANOVA of survival at 35-degrees-C showed significant effects of rearing temperature and Adh genotype, interaction between Adh and alpha-Cpdh, interaction between Adh and rearing temperature and interaction between Adh, alpha-Gpdh and rearing temperature, alpha-GPDH enzyme activity did not change significantly. Although protein content, triglycerides content and ADH enzyme activity decreased significantly at 35-degrees-C, no correlation was observed between survival and these traits. It is concluded that the world-wide cline of Adh and alpha-Gpdh allele frequencies cannot simply be explained by the genotypic differences in resistance to high temperature of adult Drosophila melanogaster.

TI  - Responses of rare calcareous grassland plants to elevated CO2: a field experiment with Gentianella germanica and Gentiana cruciata
VL  - 85
IS  - 5
SP  - 681-691
AB  - 1 Endangered plant species may be particularly vulnerable to global change. We investigated differences in the behaviour of the rare calcareous grassland species Gentiana cruciata and Gentianella germanica under ambient (360 mu l l(-1)) and elevated CO2 (600 mu l l(-1)) in a field experiment. 2 Rosettes of G. germanica and C. cruciata were planted into grassland plots with 29 other plant species. Each of the 30 rosettes of G. germanica in a plot represented a different maternal seed family, whereas G. cruciata was grown from a mixture of seeds from one field site. After overwintering, eight of the 12 plots were equipped with open-top chambers, four of which were run at ambient and four at elevated CO2 concentrations; the remaining four plots were left without chambers. 3 CO2 concentration did not significantly affect growth and survival of G. cruciata. Rosette diameter increased by 70% over 1 year. 4 Overall only 13.6% of transplanted G. germanica survived for 1 year. Elevated CO2 reduced survival by 57% (this reduction was only marginally significant due to large variation between plots) and seed set by 46%. Both these effects appeared to be mediated by competition from other species since survival and seed set were negatively correlated with total plot biomass at the time of fastest growth in June 1994 and at the time of fruit set in October, respectively. Compared with plots under ambient CO2, population growth rate (based on survival and reproduction) was reduced by 56% under elevated CO2. 5 There were no significant effects of elevated CO2 on leaf characters in either species. 6 The sugar concentration of the nectar of G. germanica was increased by 36% under elevated CO2 but its composition remained unchanged. 7 Significant interactions between the effects of seed family and CO2 concentration on demographic parameters in G. germanica indicated large genetic variation in the response to elevated CO2, which represents evolutionary potential. Although predictions based on mean responses are therefore unreliable, the majority of genotypes reacted negatively to elevated CO2, suggesting that competitive exclusion and extinction of G. germanica would occur at many sites before populations could adapt to increased concentrations of CO2.

VL  - 125
IS  - 2
SP  - 259-268
AB  - In natural field conditions Rana pipiens is an aquatic hibernator and Rana sylvatica a terrestrial hibernator. Habitat selection in the laboratory at low temperatures was similar to hibernating habitat in the field. Habitat preference tests were conducted in warm (15 C) and near-freezing (1.5 C) air temperatures. Rana pipiens shows no preference for either water or land at 15 C, but prefers water to land at 1.5 C. When given a choice between bare moist soil or moist soil covered by leaf litter, R. pipiens remains on the uncovered surface in both warm and cold conditions. Rana sylvatica prefers land to water at both 15 C and 1.5 C. At 1.5 C R. sylvatica burrows into soil and seeks cover beneath leaf litter; it also selects moist soil rather than wet mud during exposure to cold. Rana sylvatica can survive prolonged submergence in ice-covered water. Physiological adaptations such as cryoprotectants and the geographic distribution of R. sylvatica are discussed in relation to habitat selection at low temperatures.

TI  - Spatio-temporal impact of climate change on the activity and voltinism of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
SP  - 486-499
AB  - The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is one of the major insect pests of mature Norway spruce forests. In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961-2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4-3.8 degrees C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63-81% of the years. The corresponding figures are 16-33% for Mid Sweden, and 1-6% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.

TI  - Selection of Reference Genes for Optimal Normalization of Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Results for Diaphorina citri Adults
VL  - 112
IS  - 1
SP  - 355-363
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), can cause direct damage to citrus trees and is the main vector for the devastating disease, citrus greening disease or huanglongbing. Most molecular studies on this important insect pest use real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to quantify gene expression, including analyzing molecular basis for insecticide resistance in field populations. One critical factor to cause inaccuracy in RT-qPCR results is the lack of appropriate internal reference genes for optimal data normalization. In this study, the expression levels of 10 selected reference genes were evaluated in different tissue samples of psyllid adults and in the insects treated with different temperatures and insecticides. Data were analyzed using different computational algorithms, including Delta Ct, BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, and RefFinder. According to our results, at least two reference genes should be used for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in this insect. The best choices of reference genes for different samples are as follows: ACT1 and Ferritin for different tissue samples, RPS20 and Ferritin for samples treated with different temperatures, TBP and EF1 for samples treated with imidacloprid, and Ferritin and TBP for samples treated with beta-cypermethrin. The reference genes identified in this study should be useful for future studies to analyze the expression patterns of target genes, especially for genes linked with temperature adaptability and insecticide resistance in this insect species in the future.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - This study experimentally investigates the generation of polyelectrolyte droplets, and subsequently, cured microcarriers for application in microorganism cultivation. Microcarriers containing an mature microorganism culture can replace in situ biofilms in microfluidic bioprocesses to reduce the startup duration and facilitate the replenishment of functional microorganisms. This study examines the effects of particulate solutes (polystyrene (PS) microparticles, Chlorella vulgaris, and Escherichia coli) on polyelectrolyte solution properties (zeta potential, contact angle, and interfacial tension) and droplet/microcarrier formation. The results indicated that, except for interfacial tension and shear stress, the colloidal stability and morphology of particulate solutes should also be considered when generating droplets. A particulate solute resulting in a dispersed phase with colloidal stability was beneficial for the predictable droplet generation. A particulate solute increasing the affinity between the disperse phase and the channel wall hastened the droplet generation to shift from the dripping region to the jetting region. Adding particulate solutes with consistent size and morphology into the dispersed phase was less likely to affect the droplet formation and the droplet size. In this study, adding PS microparticles and C. vulgaris into a diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DDA) solution resulted in a more hydrophilic solution and higher interfacial tension compared with adding DDA solution alone. These particulate solutes also tended to cause incipient colloidal instability. The incipient instability of the C. vulgaris solution led to various droplet sizes. However, the droplet sizes of the PS microparticle solution, which had solution properties similar to those of the C. vulgaris solution, were more uniform because of the consistent size and morphology of PS microparticles. Adding moderate amounts of E. coli resulted in a more hydrophobic solution, lower interfacial tension, and satisfactory colloidal stability. The droplets containing microorganisms were cured to generate poly-DDA (PDDA) microcarriers, and E. coli cultivated in PDDA microcarriers had the same viability as those cultivated in suspension. However, C. vulgaris cultivated in PDDA microcarriers failed to proliferate possibly due to the blockage of the nutrient intake by the quaternary ammonium cation of DDA. (c) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

TI  - Metabolic Analysis of Schizochytrium Mutants With High DHA Content Achieved With ARTP Mutagenesis Combined With Iodoacetic Acid and Dehydroepiandrosterone Screening
VL  - 9
AB  - High DHA production cost caused by low DHA titer and productivity of the current Schizochytrium strains is a bottleneck for its application in competition with traditional fish-oil based approach. In this study, atmospheric and room-temperature plasma with iodoacetic acid and dehydroepiandrosterone screening led to three mutants, 6-8, 6-16 and 6-23 all with increased growth and DHA accumulations. A LC/MS metabolomic analysis revealed the increased metabolism in PPP and EMP as well as the decreased TCA cycle might be relevant to the increased growth and DHA biosynthesis in the mutants. Finally, the mutant 6-23, which achieved the highest growth and DHA accumulation among all mutants, was evaluated in a 5 L fermentor. The results showed that the DHA concentration and productivity in mutant 6-23 were 41.4 g/L and 430.7 mg/L/h in fermentation for 96 h, respectively, which is the highest reported so far in literature. The study provides a novel strain improvement strategy for DHA-producing Schizochytrium.

TI  - High pollen immigration but no gene flow via-seed into a Genetic Conservation Unit of the endangered Picea omorika after disturbance
VL  - 510
AB  - Studying how genetic diversity is transmitted between generations is critical for assessing the survival prospects of fragmented forest tree populations. This is especially urgent in the case of rare, endangered species that are at high risk of extinction and/or exceptionally susceptible to climate change, and are thus to be prioritised for conservation initiatives. We performed the first assessment of gene flow patterns by parentage analysis in the IUCN red-listed Serbian spruce [Picea omorika (Pan.c.) Purk.], within a Genetic Conservation Unit (GCU) which was exposed to fire disturbance 30 years ago. Parentage analysis was based on assigning the parentage of 104 juveniles to all the adult trees (48) present in the 2.8 ha population. All individuals were genotyped at 11 highly informative nuclear microsatellite markers. We found that fire disturbance triggered natural regeneration, usually poor to absent in Serbian spruce, and boosted pollen immigration (66%), which is reported as rather modest among undisturbed populations of this species. Seed immigration was absent, coherently with what was previously hypothesised for natural, undisturbed populations. Thus, the immigration of new gametes into the studied Serbian spruce population was accomplished exclusively through pollen gene flow, at a rate sufficient to counteract, at least in the short term, genetic drift. Furthermore, the abundant post-disturbance pollen immigration most likely accounts for the lack of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) in the juvenile cohort, contrary to the SGS observed in the adult cohort which is amongst the strongest ever recorded in anemophilous forest tree species. Finally, as generally found in forest trees, individual reproductive success was uneven among individuals, with 25% of local adults siring 70% of the sampled juveniles. Our results on post-disturbance gene flow patterns in the only Serbian spruce population with reportedly abundant regeneration complement the outcomes of previous genetic studies while providing essential information for the dynamic management and conservation of this rare and endangered species severely threatened by climate warming. Tracking the temporal development of gene flow parameters and the consequences of gene flow on genetic diversity are two cornerstones of future forest genetic monitoring programs, which are particularly important for GCUs. In particular, monitoring the genetic diversity of forest regeneration is deemed as the key for understanding changes that otherwise would remain mostly untraceable in long-lived organisms such as forest trees.

VL  - 6

SP  - 51-56
AB  - Synthetic fertilizers have low uptake efficiency by crops, it can be less than 50% of the applied fertilizer, the not incorporated fertilizer brings an adverse environmental impact, such as groundwater, contamination with NO3-, eutrophication, acid rain and global warming. An alternative to use bio-fertilizers, are microorganisms preparations applied to the soil and or plant, to replace partially or totally synthetic fertilizer. The responses to biofertilizers vary considerably, depending on kind of microorganisms, soil type, plant species and environmental conditions. Applied microorganisms must compete with native soil microflora which might be better adapted to adverse environmental conditions (lack of soil moisture, predation, high salinity and extremes pH); these factors can quickly diminish the population of any microbial species introduced into the soil. The results of this research indicate that the use of native strains in the development of biofertilizers, have a greater opportunity of effectiveness use in the field due to their adaptability to the soil conditions of each region.

VL  - 65

SP  - 2881-2892
AB  - Sexual conflicts are ubiquitous in nature and are expected to lead to an antagonistic coevolution between the sexes. This coevolutionary process is driven by selection on sexually antagonistic traits that can either be directional or fluctuating. In this study, we used dormant cysts of Artemia franciscana, collected in the same population in three different years over a 23-year period ( corresponding to similar to 160 generations in this system), to investigate male-female coevolution in natural conditions over time. We performed a cross experiment study where reproduction of females mated to males from the past, present, or future was monitored until death. In agreement with a model of "fluctuating selection," we found that females survived better and had longer interbrood intervals when mated with their contemporary males compared to when mated with males from the future or the past. However, female weekly and lifetime reproductive successes displayed no differences between contemporary and noncontemporary matings. Finally, the coevolutionary patterns ("arms race dynamics" or "fluctuating selection dynamics") possibly acting on female relative fitness could not be discriminated. This study is the first direct demonstration that the process of male-female coevolution, previously revealed by experimental evolution in laboratory artificial conditions, can occur in nature on a short evolutionary time scale.

VL  - 73
IS  - 2
SP  - 94-99
AB  - Prey animals avoid and survive encounters with predators through morphological and behavioral mechanisms, but these defenses can negatively affect fitness when individuals forgo foraging and reproductive opportunities. Although many studies have focused on the costs associated with antipredator behavior, few have evaluated how that behavior changes immediately following a nonlethal interaction with a predator. Understanding how differences in species ecology (i.e., autotomy and regeneration capabilities) influence antipredator behaviors prior to and following a predation attempt could provide insight into how animals cope with living among predators. In this study, we evaluated the antipredator and compensatory behaviors of Northern Zigzag Salamanders (Plethodon dorsalis) to determine how attempted predation affects behavioral responses to perceived predation risk. In a laboratory setting, we performed behavioral assays evaluating escape distance, exploratory movements, cover use, eating habits, and temperature preferences on individuals assigned to attacked (tail autotomy) and control treatments. We found differences in antipredator and compensatory responses between the two treatments, indicating that responses change relative to previous experiences with predators and present risk of predation. Our results indicate that attacked individuals had lower thresholds to elicit a behavioral response relative to control individuals and compensated for loss of resources and decreased locomotive ability by selecting warmer-temperature microhabitats. This study provides insight into how individuals cope with living amongst predators and emphasizes the need to explore behavioral changes following predation.

TI  - Metabolic adaptation in indigenous Siberian populations
VL  - 34
SP  - 451-471
AB  - Previous research has suggested that arctic populations have elevated metabolic rates in response to their cold, marginal climate. Recent studies of indigenous Siberian groups have confirmed these earlier findings and have shed light on the mechanisms through which northern populations adapt to their environments. Indigenous Siberians show significant elevations in basal metabolic rate compared with reference values. Total energy expenditure is variable across Siberian groups and is correlated with levels of acculturation. Siberian populations appear to have adapted to cold stress through both short-term acclimatization and genetic adaptations, with thyroid hormones playing an important role in shaping metabolic responses. Elevated metabolic rates also have important consequences for health and may contribute to the low serum lipid levels observed in Siberian groups. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of metabolic adaptation and their implications for ongoing health changes among indigenous Siberians.

In this study, we combined a modeling approach and field measurements to examine the temporal dynamics of SOC following afforestation (Robinia pseudoacacia) of former arable land at six sites under different climatic conditions in the Loess Plateau during 19802010, where the annual mean precipitation ranging from 450 mm to 600 mm. The results showed that the measured mean SOC increased to levels higher than before afforestation when taking the last measurements (i.e., at age 25 to 30 yr) at all the sites, although it decreased at the wetter sites in the first few years. The accumulation rates of SOC were 1.58 to 6.22% yr(-1) in the upper 20 cm and 1.62 to 5.15% yr(-1) in the upper 40 cm of soil. The simulations reproduced the basic characteristics of measured SOC dynamics, suggesting that litter input and climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) were the major causes for SOC dynamics and the differences among the sites. They explained 88-96, 48-86 and 57-74% of the variations in annual SOC changes at the soil depths of 0-20, 0-40, and 0-100 cm, respectively. Notably, the simulated SOC decreased during the first few years at all the sites, although the magnitudes of decreases were smaller at the drier sites. This suggested that the modeling may be advantageous in capturing SOC changes at finer timescale. The discrepancy between the simulation and measurement was a result of uncertainties in model structure, data input, and sampling design. Our findings indicated that afforestation promoted soil carbon sequestration at the study sites during 1980-2010. Afforestation activities should decrease soil disturbances to reduce carbon release in the early stage. The long-term strategy for carbon fixation capability of the plantations should also consider the climate and site conditions, species adaptability, and successional stage of recovery.

VL  - 96

AB  - Arthropods cope with reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres with a reduction in metabolic rate, also called metabolic arrest. The reduction in metabolism lessens the pressure on the organism to initiate anaerobic metabolism, but also leads to a reduction in ATP production. The natural permeability of cellular membranes appears to be important for the survival of the arthropod under low oxygen or high carbon dioxide atmospheres. Despite the similarities in response, arthropod mortality is generally greater in response to high carbon dioxide as apposed to low oxygen atmospheres. There appears to be a greater decrease in ATP and energy charge in arthropods exposed to high carbon dioxide as compared with low oxygen atmospheres, and this may be due to greater membrane permeability under carbon dioxide leading to an inefficient production of ATP. Reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres can have an additive effect in some cases, depending on the concentrations used. The effect of these atmospheres on arthropods depends also on temperature, species and life stage. Additional work is needed to fully understand the mode of action of controlled atmospheres on arthropod pests.

VL  - 82
IS  - 1
SP  - 13-24
AB  - A series of inactivation curves for Salmonella enteritidis were determined for boiling eggs using different conditions of time and temperature. No significant influence of egg weight could be found on the temperature evolution in the yolk. The inactivation curves consistently showed an initial slow decline in bacterial number at lower temperatures, after which a very rapid inactivation took place. It was not possible to reproduce this behavior using a traditional inactivation model. A pragmatic model existing in two parts was therefore constructed. When the temperature is below a certain threshold, the inactivation follows a second order temperature dependence. Above the temperature threshold, standard Bigelow inactivation kinetics are assumed. This model could describe the data reasonably well, provided that the decimal reduction time in the Bigelow model was assumed to be different for a fast or slow heating process, respectively. The results suggest that the bacteria are more resistant towards a slower heating process, which is confirmed by analyzing the raw data. A fail-safe model can be obtained by using the parameters associated with the slow heating process. The statistical properties of the calibrated model are satisfactory, and a cross-validation shows that it can be used for egg boiling conditions outside its calibration range.

TI  - Towards the accurate assessment of non-loglinear microbial survivor kinetics: Development of a freeware user-friendly tool in the area of predictive microbiology
SP  - 82-86
AB  - This contribution focuses on the presentation of GInaFiT (Geeraerd et al. Inactivation Model Fitting Tool), a freeware Add-inn for Microsoft (R) Excel aiming at bridging the gap between people developing predictive modeling approaches and end-users in the food industry not disposing over advanced non-linear regression analysis tools. More precisely, the tool is useful for testing eight different types of microbial survival models on user-specific experimental data relating the evolution of the microbial population with time. The eight model types are: (i) classical log-linear curves, (ii) curves displaying a so-called shoulder before a log-linear decrease is apparent, (iii) curves displaying a so-called tail after a log-linear decrease, (iv) survival curves displaying both shoulder and tailing behavior, (v) concave curves, (vi) convex curves, (vii) convex/concave curves followed by tailing, and (viii) biphasic inactivation kinetics. Next to the obtained parameter values, the following statistical measures are automatically reported: standard errors of the parameter values, the Sum of Squared Errors, the Mean Sum of Squared Errors, the R 2 and the adjusted R-2. The tool is downloadable via the KULeuven/BioTeC-homepage http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/cit/biotec/index.htm at the topic "Downloads" (Version 1.3, Release date July 2004).

VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - In this study, MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation, and MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST) data were used as data sources in an analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation changes and ecological environmental quality in the Huaihe River basin, China, from 2003 to 2018. The Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test and the Theil-Sen slope test were combined for this analysis; then, when combined with the results of the MK mutation test and two introduced indexes, the kurtosis coefficient (KU) and skewness (SK) and correlations between NDVI, precipitation (TRMM), and land-surface temperature (LST) in different time scales were revealed. The results illustrate that the mean NDVI in the Huaihe River basin was 0.54. The annual NDVImax curve fluctuations for different land cover types were almost the same. The main reasons for the decrease in or disappearance of vegetation cover in the Huaihe River basin were the expansion of towns and impact of human activities. Furthermore, vegetation cover around water areas was obviously degraded and wetland protections need to be strengthened urgently. On the same time scale, change trends of NDVI, TRMM, and LST after abrupt changes became consistent within a short time period. Vegetation growth was favored when the KU and SK of TRMM had a close to normal distribution within one year. Monthly TRMM and LST can better reflect NDVI fluctuations compared with seasonal and annual scales. When the precipitation (TRMM) is less than 767 mm, the average annual NDVI of different land cover types is not ideal. Compared with other land cover types, dry land has stronger adaptability to changes in the LST when the LST is between 19 and 22.6 degrees C. These trends can serve as scientific reference for protecting and managing the ecological environment in the Huaihe River basin.

TI  - Thermal melanism explains macroevolutionary variation of dorsal pigmentation in Eurasian vipers
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Colouration may endorse thermoregulatory and antipredatory functions in snakes. The thermal melanism hypothesis predicts that dark-coloured individuals are ecologically favoured in cool climates. However, the loss of aposematic and cryptic colourations may imply high predation for melanistic snakes. Here, we used the monophyletic group of Eurasian vipers (subfamily Viperinae) to test whether an increase in the extent of dark area inside the characteristic zigzag dorsal pattern is associated to colder environments. We measured two colouration traits in zigzag-patterned individuals (number of dorsal marks and weighted pigmentation index) and used a phylogenetic comparative approach to explore macroevolutionary patterns of dorsal pigmentation and test whether its extent is associated to ecogeographic characteristics of lineages' ranges. Phylogenetically-naive and phylogenetically-informed analyses yielded a significant association between the degree of pigmentation of the zigzag pattern and environmental variables such as solar radiation, elevation and latitude. The degree of pigmentation of the zigzag pattern is highlighted as an adaptive trait that matches range attributes mirroring cold environments irrespective of the phylogeny. These results constitute the first large-scale evidence supporting the thermal melanism hypothesis in snakes, opening new avenues of inquiry for the mechanisms that shape the evolution of colour phenotypes.

TI  - A review on solid biofuel usage in Lithuania after the decommission of Ignalina NPP and compliance with the EU policy
VL  - 54
SP  - 974-988
AB  - The paper provides a review on solid biofuel usage in Lithuania after decommission of Ignalina NPP and cover the period 2007-2012. Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is depended upon the import of energy resources, such as natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up to the year 2009 about 70-80% of electricity was produced from NPP. Lithuanian energy dependence from energy resources in 2009 was about 50.3%. At the end of 2009, NPP was decommissioned and the structure of gross inland fuel and energy consumption changed radically. Lithuania's energy dependence on the imports of fuel increased to about 82% and considerably exceeded the EU average 54%. The share of indigenous and renewable energy sources (RES) in gross inland fuel and energy consumption increased from 14.7% in 2009 to 21.4% in 2013 from which about 86% of RES belonged to solid biofuels. The RES became one of the main driving forces of the country's economy. In this paper, the Lithuanian solid biofuel resources and energy production up to the 2013 are presented. Growing stock volume, forest coverage, productivity of stands and consumption for energy production in Lithuania and its counties are defined. Fuels and energy flows diagram and distribution of solid biofiiels by economy sectors and consumer groups are shown. Solid biofuels usage impact to gross inland and final energy consumption was studied. Implementation of solid biofuels for heat and electricity generation in Lithuania was researched. Solid biofuel prices were examined and comparison with prices of natural gas and fuel oil was done. Principles and criteria for sustainable solid biofuels production and usage were disclosed. The reduction of total greenhouse gases emissions in Lithuania and other EU countries were shown. Strategic initiatives to increase the RES share in electricity and heating sectors till 2020 were highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 39

SP  - 113-119
AB  - The introduction of allochthonous species often represents a serious problem for ecosystems and native species. Usually, these cases involve common widespread species that show high adaptability and strong competitiveness against local species. Within amphibians, the introduction of allochthonous species mainly deals with anurans, while cases involving caudata are few and poorly studied. We report the first assessment of an introduced population of European plethodontid salamanders. This population is located in the French Pyrenees and represents the oldest allochthonous Hydromantes population. We reconstructed the history of its introduction and collected data on the ecology and feeding habits of this population. Our results show that this population is stable and reproductive, showing strong similarities to Italian mainland species of Hydromantes. This study provided the base for further studies focused on this allochthonous population of European cave salamanders.

VL  - 186

SP  - 213-221
AB  - Animals with overlapping generations may be selected to change their sex ratios after perturbation of the stable age distribution. Specifically, Werren and Taylor have shown that in a tightly regulated population with normally constant recruitment, sex ratios are biased at times of exceptional recruitment towards the sex with the most even distribution of reproductive value over its adult life. It is shown that an episode of exceptional recruitment also affects the optimal sex ratios of cohorts born subsequently, although the sex ratio adjustment is typically in the opposite direction. It is also shown that the expected sex ratio depends critically on female mating behaviour: whether females mate throughout their reproductive life or, as in many insects, once after emergence. Perturbation of the stable age distribution by an episode of exceptional mortality may also lead to selection for biased sex ratios, even if the mortality affects both sexes equally.

IS  - 70
SP  - 42-58
AB  - The article describes the results of a psychological field experiment conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program on improving students' resilience and psychological resistance to extreme factors in the simulation of professional activity. The study was conducted in the Far East Fire and Rescue Academy. The sample is represented by 52 cadets of the faculty of fire safety from 19 to 21 years of age. Type of the research: psychological field experiment with the use of smoke and heat simulation training facilities. At the stage of ascertaining experiment in 2016 diagnostic sections were carried out on the entire sample to study the psychological characteristics and physiological reactions to stress in the smoke and heat training chambers. Targets for psychological exposure were identified. At the stage of the formative experiment, the random sampling was divided into experimental and control groups. Cadets of the experimental groups (30 participants) participated in the program to improve resilience and psychological stability. Cadets of the control group (22 participants) did not participate in the psychological program. At the stage of the control experiment with the participation of the entire sample in 2017 a repeated study of psychological characteristics and physiological responses to stress in smoke and heat training chambers was conducted. Methods of psychological diagnostics: test of viability by D.A. Leontiev and E.I. Rasskazova; Life-purpose Orientations test by D.A. Leontiev; Multifactor Personality Questionnaire "Adaptability"; coping test by R. Lazarus, method of determining the accentuations of character by K. Leonhard and G. Shmisek; Ltischer-Test modified by L.N. Sobchik; the Structure of motivation of labor activity" C. Zamfir, the method of studying motivation in university studies by T.I. Ilyina; correction tables (Landolt rings). Methods of studying the psycho-physiological parameters: "Heart rate variability analysis" of the rehabilitation psycho-physiological complex "Reakor"; assessment of the functional state of the central nervous system based on a simple visual motor reaction using a psycho physiological testing device "Psychophysiologist". Statistical methods: nonparametric Wilcoxon T-test, IBM SPSS Statistics 20. The results of the study showed that the program of psychological support for cadets: contributes to the improvement of vitality and emotional stability, and clarifies the life purpose orientations. In addition, the indicators of personal adaptive potential and regulation of behavior increase. The program allows to regulate coping behavior strategies, as well as at the psychological and psycho-physiological levels it helps to improve the attention functions and the level of performance.

VL  - 17

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the thermomechanical and in vitro biological response of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) plates for craniofacial reconstructive surgery. Methods: PLGA 85/15 craniofacial plates were produced by injection molding by testing two different temperatures (i.e., 240 degrees C, PLGA_lowT, and 280 degrees C, PLGA_highT). The mechanical properties of the produced plates were characterized by three-point bending tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, and residual stress. Crystallinity and thermal transitions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, in vitro cell interaction was evaluated by using SAOS-2 as cell model. Indirect cytotoxicity tests (ISO 10-993) were performed to prove the absence of cytotoxic release. Cells were then directly seeded on the plates and their viability, morphology, and functionality (ALP) checked up to 21 days of culture. Results: A similar performance of PLGA_lowT and PLGA_highT plates was verified in the three-point bending test and dynamic mechanical analyses. Also, the two processing temperatures did not influence the in vitro cell interaction. Cytotoxicity and ALP activity were similar for the PLGA plates and control. Cell results demonstrated that the PLGA plates supported cell attachment and proliferation. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the presence of sub-micron particles, which were identified as inorganic mineral deposits resulting from osteoblast activity. Conclusion: The present work demonstrated that the selected processing temperatures did not affect the material performance. PLGA plates showed good mechanical properties for application in craniofacial reconstructive surgery and adequate biological properties.

VL  - 14
IS  - 3
SP  - 289-298
AB  - Stress often induces metabolically expensive countermeasures. Bivalve shell production is costly and can thus be indirectly impacted by environmental stress. Suboptimal salinity and temperature may constitute stressors that allocate energy away from shell production to cellular processes such as osmoregulation or to the repair of cellular damage. In the course of climate change, water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are predicted to increase, and salinity is predicted to regionally decrease. These shifts may lead to increased stress for temperate marine species adapted to relatively cool water temperatures and high salinity conditions. To better understand the importance of climate change-related stress, we assessed the isolated and interactive effects of salinity and temperature on shell increment (cumulative growth: shell), cellular oxidative stress (accumulation of oxidized lipids and proteins: lipofuscin), instantaneous physiological condition (condition index: CI), and mortality of young Mytilus edulis and Arctica islandica from the western Baltic Sea. Temperature and salinity interactively affected shell increment, lipofuscin accumulation, and mortality of M. edulis as well as shell increment of A. islandica. Shell increment of M. edulis was less affected by hyposalinity than shell increment of A. islandica. In both species the CI decreased and lipofuscin accumulation increased with increasing temperature. Lipofuscin accumulation negatively correlated with shell increment in M. edulis. We conclude that Baltic Sea populations of ecologically relevant bivalve species may experience severe stress by the predicted regional scenario of warming and desalination if evolutionary adaptation does not happen at a similar rate.

TI  - Population-specific transcriptional differences associated with freeze tolerance in a terrestrial worm
VL  - 8
IS  - 7
SP  - 3774-3786
AB  - Enchytraeus albidus is a terrestrial earthworm widespread along the coasts of northern Europe and the Arctic. This species tolerates freezing of body fluids and survives winters in a frozen state. Their acclimatory physiological mechanisms behind freeze tolerance involve increased fluidity of membrane lipids during cold exposure and accumulation of cryoprotectants (glucose) during the freezing process. Gene regulatory processes of these physiological responses have not been studied, partly because no gene expression tools were developed. The main aim of this study was to understand whether the freeze tolerance mechanisms have a transcriptomic basis in E.albidus. For that purpose, first the transcriptome of E.albidus was assembled with RNAseq data. Second, two strains from contrasting thermal environments (Germany and Greenland) were compared by mapping barcoded RNAseq data onto the assembled transcriptome. Both of these strains are freeze tolerant, but Greenland is extremely freeze tolerant. Results showed more plastic responses in the Greenland strain as well as higher constitutive expression of particular stress response genes. These altered transcriptional networks are associated with an adapted homeostasis coping with prolonged freezing conditions in Greenland animals. Previously identified physiological alterations in freeze-tolerant strains of E.albidus are underpinned at the transcriptome level. These processes involve anion transport in the hemolymph, fatty acid metabolism, metabolism, and transport of cryoprotective sugars as well as protection against oxidative stress. Pathway analysis supported most of these processes, and identified additional differentially expressed pathways such as peroxisome and Toll-like receptor signaling. We propose that the freeze-tolerant phenotype is the consequence of genetic adaptation to cold stress and may have driven evolutionary divergence of the two strains.

Using a longitudinal data set of 3196 professional archers in 57 competitions during 2010-2016 in China, which includes accurate performance measures at the individual-by-contest level, we show that heat causes more uneven performance distributions by hurting the bottom performers more than the top performers. More frequent heat reduces average performance and raises distributional inequality more than increases in average temperature. Gaining experience and long-term acclimatization together can mitigate 70% of the heat impacts, demonstrating the potential of adaptation.

TI  - Experimental investigation on a passive injection and depressurization system for next generation of nuclear power plant
SP  - 185-198
AB  - The new generation of Nuclear Power Plant (e.g. WESTINGHOUSE AP600, GE Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR), ABB Process Inherent Ultimate Safety (PIUS), etc.) have been designed in order to satisfy today's needs. They are simple, economic: midsize and fully standardized. Those plants enhance safety by extensively relying on passive safety systems that use natural forces and phenomena such as gravity, condensation and evaporation. Evolutionary plants rely on a full Reactor Coolant System (RCS) depressurization to allow gravity injection from an In Containment Tank and assure with its operation the long term core cooling. Depressurization is obtained by the opening of Motor Operated Valves or Squib valves actuated on a logic signal. The concept of depressurizing the primary system following a Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) signal was even developed in The past for the application to the Westinghouse Pressurizer Water Reactor (PWR) Italian Reference Plant. Studies performed to support the licensing process and design of both evolutionary and innovative reactors, have shown that cold water injection may, under particular plant conditions. induce a large plant depressurization. The conceptual design of a Passive Injection and Depressurization System (PIDS), based on the idea of depressurizing die Reactor Coolant System (RCS) by mixing cold water with die RCS hot water and inducing steam condensation in the primary system, has been pursued. While, die PIDS concept is applicable both to boiling and pressurized water reactor design, the PIDS so far developed has been conceived for the application to a PWR design. Due to die PIDS innovative concept: before proceeding to the actual system design, an experimental campaign has been undertaken. The aim was to explore the physical phenomena occurring during system actuation and operation and to demonstrate die concept viability. The first experimental step, devoted to asses siphon triggering phenomenologies and the components performances of the PIDS, has been performed at SIET laboratory in Piacenza, Italy. The test objectives were to: identify the limit conditions which would lead to an adverse mass distribution, then delaying the PIDS intervention (i.e. TMI Scenarios-Pressurizer filled by a Water/Steam mixture), confirm that the system will be actuated as soon as the reactor coolant system water level reaches the actuation level; confirm that spurious actuations are not foreseen; confirm that the injection flow is stable during PIDS operation: characterize the PIDS components performances: assess the PIDS performance in presence of non condensable gasses. The test facility design and scaling and the experimental activities have been supported by extensive RELAP5 Mod3 simulations, A visual tool (Nuclear Plant Analyzer, NPA) has been also used for the analysis of die results. The present paper. after a brief description of the PIDS concept, reports some of die more significant pretest analyses and experimental test results.

TI  - Lack of genetic variation in the response of a trematode parasite to ocean acidification
VL  - 163
IS  - 1
AB  - Ocean acidification is already having measurable impacts on marine ecosystems. Intraspecific variation in the responses of marine organisms to ocean acidification can reveal genetic differences in tolerance to low pH conditions and determine the potential for a species to adapt to a changing environment. This study tests for the existence of genetic variation in both the transmission success of the trematode Maritrema novaezealandense to its second intermediate amphipod host, Paracalliope novizealandiae, and the extent of parasite-induced mortality in that host, in response to decreasing pH. Eight parasite genotypes were tested in a custom-built ocean acidification simulation system, at 8.1 pH (current ocean conditions) and under conditions of 7.4 pH (worst-case scenario future prediction). The parasites had significantly higher infection success in the more acidic treatment, but there was no significant difference among genotypes in how infection success was affected by pH. In contrast, some parasite genotypes induced higher mortality in amphipods than other genotypes, but this genetic effect was also independent of pH. Overall, our results reveal no significant intergenotype variation in how the parasite responds to ocean acidification with respect to two key traits, infection success and parasite-induced host mortality, suggesting limited potential for adaptation in the face of acidifying conditions.

VL  - 250
IS  - 3
SP  - 579-585
AB  - The Oceanic Institute (01), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Arizona (UAZ), established a population of specific pathogen free (SPF) Fenneropenaeus chinensis through Secondary Quarantine (SQ) in Kona, Hawaii. Shrimp were 0.38 g (S.D.+/- 0.13 g) when they entered the nursery/growout module of the SQ facility. Juveniles from five maternal families were stocked in separate 230-L nursery tanks, as was a sixth family comprised of shrimp from two of the seven original spawns. After tagging, representative shrimp from all six families were stocked in a 50-m(2) concrete raceway that was enclosed in a biosecure greenhouse. After 155 days in the growout module, mean shrimp weight was 23.4 g (S.D.+/- 7.25 g) and females (29.1 +/- 4.61 g) were 74% larger than males (16.7 +/- 2.44 g). A Sprung Structure (TM) was erected to enclose the biosecure maturation and hatchery module of the SQ facility. Broodstock were subjected to an acclimation process where they were kept in seawater at 22 degrees C, followed by a reduction in water temperature of 1 degrees C/day until the temperature reached 17 degrees C. At this time, unilateral eyestalk ablation was performed on female broodstock and water temperature was further reduced at the same rate until it reached 12 degrees C. After 2 weeks, water temperature was raised to 17 degrees C at a rate of 1 degrees C/day to induce ovarian development. Production of an F, generation of Fe. chinensis was successfully accomplished using artificial insemination, and representative shrimp from this generation have tested negative for all specifically listed pathogens using histology and PCR/RT-PCR. Of particular interest with Fe. chinensis is their cold tolerance. This species may represent a valuable resource for shrimp farmers in temperate and sub-tropical climates to grow a second "winter" crop, thereby increasing production and profitability for the shrimp farmer.

TI  - Practical approach of simultaneous optimization of variable blank holder force and variable slide velocity trajectory in sheet metal forming
VL  - 98
IS  - 9
SP  - 2693-2703
AB  - Variable blank holder force (VBHF) that the blank holder force varies through the stroke is recognized as one of the advanced manufacturing technologies for sheet metal forming. On the other hand, slide velocity (SV) that controls the die velocity is rarely discussed in the literature. In particular, variable SV (VSV) that the SV varies through the forming process is an attractive forming technique for improving the product quality and the productivity. This paper proposes a practical approach of optimization of VBHF and VSV trajectory for sheet forming. First, based on the experimental result, the finite element analysis model is developed. Then, a multi-objective design optimization considering the product quality and the productivity is performed. A sequential approximate optimization that response surface is repeatedly constructed and optimized is adopted to identify the pareto-frontier. Three points on the pareto-frontier are selected, and the experiment using the servo press (H1F200-2, Komatsu Industries, Corp.) is conducted. Through the comparison of numerical and experimental results, the validity of the proposed approach is examined.

VL  - 46
AB  - Heavy metal ions contamination, a threat to ecological balance, aquatic life, and human health, co-exists in water bodies and soil systems such as mining sites, tanneries, petrochemical refineries, pesticide, fertilizer, construction, chemical industries, and others. In this study, raw rice husk and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated novel rice husk (RH)-based adsorbents: potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated RH (KOH-RH), KOH activated RH hydrochar (KOH-RHH), and KOH activated silver (Ag) nanoparticle modified RH (AgNP-KOH-RH) were synthesized and applied on synthetic wastewater to treat hazardous heavy metal ions, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ through fixed-bed flow column adsorption. Maximum Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ uptake was obtained 7.14 mg/g, 9.02 mg/g and 8.53 mg/g, respectively by KOH-RHH. The maximum Fe3+ and Mn2+ uptake was 1.66 mg/g and 0.98 mg/g, respectively by AgNP-KOH-RH. After 1st run of adsorption, the adsorbents were recovered and reused for 2nd adsorption run. Maximum Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ uptake was 11.98 mg/g, 9.46 mg/g, 1.29 mg/g, 19.55 mg/g and 14.58 mg/g, respectively obtained by KOH-RHH at 2nd adsorption run. AgNP-KOH-RH obtained the minimum retention time for adsorption and maximum color removal for both runs. Compared with commercial adsorbents such as coconut shell activated carbon, higher heavy metal ions adsorption capacity (>90%) and color removal have been obtained with both KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted into the intra-particle diffusion (IPD) kinetics model. The detailed characterization of the adsorbents such as surface area, porosity, and surface morphology was conducted for deriving the mechanism. It can be stated that the significant adsorption capacity of heavy metals and color by KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH with repetitive adsorption runs will provide new insight into adsorption mechanisms and the development of next-generation commercial adsorbents for industrial wastewater treatment.

VL  - 26

SP  - 1093-1101
AB  - Ne-(2-furoylmethyl)-l-lysine (furosine) is well-known indicator of early stage of Maillard reaction in processed food. Yet the toxicological aspects associated with its exposure remain rarely studied. Here, we investigated the effects of furosine exposure on cell viability, DNA damage, and its mutagenic potential by using MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide), TUNEL assay (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling assay), and Ames assay techniques on human cell lines, i.e., liver HepG-2, kidney Hek-293, neuronal SK-N-SH, and intestinal Caco-2, respectively. Our results showed that kidney Hek-293 cell line was the most sensitive to furosine exposure as significant reduction in cell viability and induction of DNA damage were observed at 50 mg/L concentration. In contrast, intestinal Caco-2 cell lines showed resistance to furosine exposure as DNA damage was only observed at 800 mg/L concentration of furosine. Ames assay indicated that furosine has no mutagenic effects on TA 100 and TA 1535 strains. Hence, this study suggests that furosine is a strong toxicant for kidney cells.

TI  - Clumped methane isotopologue-based temperature estimates for sources of methane in marine gas hydrates and associated vent gases
VL  - 327
SP  - 276-297
AB  - Gas hydrates stored in the continental margins of the world's oceans represent the largest global reservoirs of methane. Determining the source and history of methane from gas hydrate deposits informs the viability of sites as energy resources, and potential hazards from hydrate dissociation or intense methane degassing from ocean warming. Stable isotope ratios of methane (C-13/C-12, D/H) and the molecular ratio of methane over ethane plus propane (C1/C2+3) have traditionally been applied to infer methane sources, but often yield ambiguous results when two or more sources are mixed, or when compositions were altered by physical (e.g., diffusion) or microbial (e.g., methanotrophy) processes. We measured the abundance of clumped methane isotopologue (13CH3D) alongside 13C/12C and D/H of methane, and C1/C2+3 for 46 submarine gas hydrate specimens and associated vent gases from 11 regions of the world's oceans. These samples are associated with different seafloor seepage features (oil seeps, pockmarks, mud volcanoes, and other cold seeps). The average apparent equilibration temperatures of methane from the D13CH3D (the excess abundance of 13CH3D relative to the stochastic distribution) geothermometer increase from cold seeps (15-65 & DEG;C) and pockmarks (36-54 ?), to oil-associated gas hydrates (48-120 & DEG;C). These apparent temperatures are consistent with, or a few tens of degrees higher than, the temperature expected for putative microbial methane sources. Apparent methane generation depths were derived for cold seep, pockmark, and oil seep methane from isotopologue-based temperatures and the local geothermal gradients. Estimated methane generation depths ranged from 0.2 to 5.3 kmbsf, and are largely consistent with source rock information, and other chemical geothermometers based on clay mineralogy and fluid chemistry (e.g., Cl, B, and Li). Methane associated with mud volcanoes yielded a wide range of apparent temperatures (15-313 & DEG;C). Gas hydrates from mud volcanoes the Kumano Basin and Mediterranean Sea yielded 813C-CH4 values from-36.9 to-51.0%, typical for thermogenic sources. D13CH3D values (3.8-6.0%) from these sites, however, are consistent with prevailing microbial sources. These mud volcanoes are located at active convergent plate margins, where hydrogen may be supplied from basement rocks, and fuel methanogenesis to the point of substrate depletion. In contrast, gas hydrate from mud volcanoes located on km-thick sediments in tectonically less active or passive settings (Black Sea, North Atlantic) yielded microbial-like 813C-CH4 and C1/C2+3 values, and low D13CH3D values (1.6-3.3%), which may be due to kinetic isotope effects. Additionally, using samples from two sites, we found that D13CH3D values of hydrate-bound gas and vent gas agree within measurement error. This study is the first to document the link between methane isotopologue-based temperature estimates and key submarine gas hydrate seepage features, and validate previous models about their geologic driving forces.

VL  - 29
IS  - 5
SP  - 925-929
AB  - The objective of this work was to identify potato characteristics that have higher adaptation stability for important agronomic characteristics for the contrasting autumn and spring climatic conditions of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The tuber characteristics evaluated were maturity, average number of tuber plant yield, texture, tuber shape, depth of eyes and general appearance. Reduced tuber quality and yield were observed in the autumn crop compared to the spring, due to variations in temperature, radiation and photoperiod. Coefficient of variation were higher in the autumn, in particular for plant yield, average number of tubers, texture and general appearance. Correlation coefficients were moderately high and significant (r < 0,80) for texture, tuber shape and depth of eyes, and low (r < 0,40) for maturity, number of tubers, plant yield and general appearance. The results of this study showed that the characteristics and population studied, the plant productivity and number of tubers are not constant parameters comparing crops in contrasting climates. Characteristics such as texture, tuber shape and depth of eyes can be selected with high intensities, based on their high stability. Selection based on tuber general appearance may be more intense in the spring, when the quality and productivity parameters are maximized.

TI  - Nonrandom RNAseq gene expression associated with RNAlater and flash freezing storage methods
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 456-464
AB  - RNA sequencing is a popular next-generation sequencing technique for assaying genome-wide gene expression profiles. Nonetheless, it is susceptible to biases that are introduced by sample handling prior gene expression measurements. Two of the most common methods for preserving samples in both field-based and laboratory conditions are submersion in RNAlater and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen can be impractical, particularly for field collections. RNAlater is a solution for stabilizing tissue for longer-term storage as it rapidly permeates tissue to protect cellular RNA. In this study, we assessed genome-wide expression patterns in 30-day-old fry collected from the same brood at the same time point that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degrees C or submerged and stored in RNAlater at room temperature, simulating conditions of fieldwork. We show that sample storage is a significant factor influencing observed differential gene expression. In particular, genes with elevated GC content exhibit higher observed expression levels in liquid nitrogen flash-freezing relative to RNAlater storage. Further, genes with higher expression in RNAlater relative to liquid nitrogen experience disproportionate enrichment for functional categories, many of which are involved in RNA processing. This suggests that RNAlater may elicit a physiological response that has the potential to bias biological interpretations of expression studies. The biases introduced to observed gene expression arising from mimicking many field-based studies are substantial and should not be ignored.

TI  - The economic viability of a feed-in tariff scheme that solely rewards self-consumption to promote the use of integrated photovoltaic battery systems
VL  - 183
SP  - 1075-1085
AB  - With reference to an integrated photovoltaic battery (PV-BES) system for grid-connected end users, a feed-in tariff scheme is discussed in this article. This scheme solely rewards self-consumption. Zero is the generation price paid for the generated renewable energy, and zero is the export price paid for the renewable energy delivered to the grid. This feed-in tariff scheme, referred to as S-FIT, also excludes the net-metering service and the possibility that the grid recharges or discharges the batteries. To calculate the incentive tariff, an optimization problem is adopted. The problem returns the minimum value of the tariff so that the subsidy given to the end user is equal to the difference between the instalments paid for the integrated PV-BES system and the savings obtained from the electricity bill. The period during which the end user has secured this grant is ten years. The S-FIT scheme is applied to the case of the Italian Public Administration from 2011 to 2015. Consequently, the real values of temperature, irradiation, and energy consumption are measured every 15 min, and the real electricity prices over the period 2011-2015 are considered. The optimal solution returned by the optimization problem allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill by 49.56%; moreover, the self-produced energy is equal to at least 50%, whereas the self-consumed energy is equal to at least 80%. The optimal solution that is calculated using 2011 data is applied for 2012-2015. Although the electricity prices were subject to a radical change during this period, the optimal solution still allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill; in particular, this reduction is equal to 44.98% when the PV-BES system is adopted, whereas it is equal to 33.65% when only the PV system is adopted. In both cases, the optimal solution ensures self-produced energy of at least 50% and self-consumed energy of at least 80%. This article ends with an assessment of the impact of the integrated PV-BES system on the load profile from the grid perspective and the satisfactory degree of self-sufficiency achieved by the end user.

TI  - CHROMOSPHERIC AND CORONAL WAVE GENERATION IN A MAGNETIC FLUX SHEATH
VL  - 827
IS  - 1
AB  - Using radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmospheric layers from the upper convection zone to the lower corona, we investigate the self-consistent excitation of slow magneto-acoustic body waves (slow modes) in a magnetic flux concentration. We find that the convective downdrafts in the close surroundings of a two-dimensional flux slab "pump" the plasma inside it in the downward direction. This action produces a downflow inside the flux slab, which encompasses ever higher layers, causing an upwardly propagating rarefaction wave. The slow mode, excited by the adiabatic compression of the downflow near the optical surface, travels along the magnetic field in the upward direction at the tube speed. It develops into a shock wave at chromospheric heights, where it dissipates, lifts the transition region, and produces an offspring in the form of a compressive wave that propagates further into the corona. In the wake of downflows and propagating shock waves, the atmosphere inside the flux slab in the chromosphere and higher tends to oscillate with a period of nu approximate to 4 mHz. We conclude that this process of "magnetic pumping" is a most plausible mechanism for the direct generation of longitudinal chromospheric and coronal compressive waves within magnetic flux concentrations, and it may provide an important heat source in the chromosphere. It may also be responsible for certain types of dynamic fibrils.

TI  - FLUID ABSENT MELTING OF A LAYERED CRUSTAL PROTOLITH - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GENERATION OF ANATECTIC GRANITES
VL  - 114
IS  - 3
SP  - 365-378
AB  - We report the result of H2O-undersaturated melting experiments on charges consisting of a layer of powdered sillimanite-bearing metapelite (HQ36) and a layer of powdered tonalitic gneiss (AGC150). Experiments were conducted at 10 kbar at 900-degrees, 925-degrees and 950-degrees-C. When run alone, the pelite yielded approximately 40 vol% strongly peraluminous granitic melt at 900-degrees-C while the tonalite produced only approximately 5 vol% weakly peraluminous granitic melt. At 950-degrees-C, the pelite and the tonalite yielded approximately 50 vol% and approximately 7 vol% granitic melt, respectively. When run side by side, the abundance of melt in the tonalite was approximately 10 times higher at all temperatures than when it was run alone. In the pelite, the melt abundance increased by approximately 25 vol%. When run alone, biotite dehydration-melting in the tonalite yielded orthopyroxene and garnet in addition to granitic melt. When run side by side only garnet was produced in addition to granitic melt. Experiments of relatively short duration, however, also contained Al-rich orthopyroxene. We suggest that the large increase in melt fraction in the tonalite is mainly a result of increased activity of Al2O3 in the melt, which lowers the temperature of the biotite dehydration-melting reaction. In the pelite, the increase in the abundance of melt is caused by transport of plagioclase component in the melt from the tonalite-layer to the pelite-layer. This has the effect of changing the bulk composition of this layer in the direction of ''minimum-temperature'' granitic liquids. Our results show that rocks which are poor melt-producers on their own can become very fertile if they occur in contact with rocks that contain components that destabilize the hydrous phase(s) and facilitate dehydration-melting. Because of this effect, the continental crust may have an even greater potential for granitoid melt production than previously thought. Our results also suggest that many anatectic granites most likely contain contributions from two or more different source rocks, which will be reflected in their isotopic and geochemical compositions.

TI  - Extreme Temperature Events (ETEs) in South Africa: a review
VL  - 104
IS  - 1
SP  - 70-88
AB  - Extreme Temperature Events (ETEs), including heatwaves, warm spells, cold waves and cold spells, have disastrous impacts on human health and ecosystems. The frequency, intensity, and duration of ETEs is projected to increase due to climate change. However, very little research has been done on ETEs in South Africa, and only a few attempts have been made to identify and examine trends. Currently, ten known publications have examined ETEs across South Africa, the majority of which use the South African Weather Service (SAWS) climate database as the primary source. The general findings indicate that the incidence and duration of extreme warm temperatures are increasing, while cold extremes are decreasing. However, inconstancies exist in the indices used to identify ETEs, selection of meteorological stations, study period, and statistical methods used to examine trends. We review the methodological approaches to define ETEs, the extreme temperature indices adopted, the selection of meteorological stations, study periods, data quality and homogeneity, statistical trend analysis, and results. From these, we propose an approximate number of stations to adequately portray temperature variability on a national and regional level. Finally, we reflect on projections of ETEs under current climate change conditions, and the implications of cold and warm ETEs in a South African context.

TI  - Lag Phase Is a Dynamic, Organized, Adaptive, and Evolvable Period That Prepares Bacteria for Cell Division
VL  - 201
IS  - 7
AB  - Lag is a temporary period of nonreplication seen in bacteria that are introduced to new media. Despite latency being described by Muller in 1895, only recently have we gained insights into the cellular processes characterizing lag phase. This review covers literature to date on the transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, physiological, biochemical, and evolutionary features of prokaryotic lag. Though lag is commonly described as a preparative phase that allows bacteria to harvest nutrients and adapt to new environments, the implications of recent studies indicate that a refinement of this view is well deserved. As shown, lag is a dynamic, organized, adaptive, and evolvable process that protects bacteria from threats, promotes reproductive fitness, and is broadly relevant to the study of bacterial evolution, host-pathogen interactions, antibiotic tolerance, environmental biology, molecular microbiology, and food safety.

AB  - We describe a hot-air treatment device to be used in quarantine research to disinfest fruits of pests. The device consists of instruments mounted to a 1.905 cm thick plywood structure (1.2 m long by 1.2 m wide by 2.44 m high) with an insulated door. Relays, fuses, heater, fan, steam generator, airflow meter, dew-point sampling system, and thermocouple wires are connected to electricity and to each other through a main power panel and to a computer. The software used controlled air at precise dry-bulb and dew-point temperatures for selected time durations to prevent condensation on fruit surfaces and fruit desiccation. Air mass flow rate was adjustable with a variable speed control. When 'Keitt' mangoes infested with Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew), larvae were treated with air at 51.67-degrees-C for 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min, mortality was 20, 45, 79, 96, 100, and 100%, respectively. The estimated treatment time for 99.9968% mortality was 101 min (85-131 min, 95% FL).

TI  - Co-infection with Opisthorchis viverrini and Haplorchis taichui detected by human fecal examination in Chomtong district, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand
VL  - 61
IS  - 1
SP  - 56-59
AB  - Diseases caused by the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini and the minute intestinal fluke. Haplorchis taichui, are clinically important, especially in the Northeast and North regions of Thailand. It is often difficult to distinguish between these trematode species using morphological methods due to the similarity of their eggs and larval stages both in mixed and co-infections. A sensitive, accurate, and specific detection method of these flukes is required for an effective epidemiological control program. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of O. viverrini and H. taichui infections in human feces by using formalin-ether sedimentation and high annealing temperature random amplified polymorphic DNA (HAT-RAPD) PCR methods. Fecal specimens of people living along the Mae Ping River, Chomtong district were examined seasonally for trematode eggs using a compound microscope. Positive cases were analyzed in FIAT-RAPD, DNA profiles were compared with adult stages to determine the actual species infected, and specific DNA markers of each fluke were also screened. Our results showed that out of 316 specimens, 62 were positive for fluke eggs which were pre-identified as O. viverrini and H. taichui. In addition, co-infection among these two fluke species was observed from only two specimens. The prevalence of H. taichui infections peaked in the hot-dry (19.62%), gradually decreased in the rainy (18.18%), and cool-dry seasons (14.54%), respectively. O. viverrini was found only in the hot-dry season (6.54%). For molecular studies, 5 arbitrary primers (Operon Technologies, USA) were individually performed in HAT-RAPD-PCR for the generation of polymorphic DNA profiles. The DNA profiles in all 62 positives cases were the same as those of the adult stage which confirmed our identifications. This study demonstrates the mixed infection of O. viverrini and H. taichui and confirms the extended distribution of O. viverrini in Northern Thailand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Origin of H-2 Evolution in LIBs: H2O Reduction vs. Electrolyte Oxidation
VL  - 163
IS  - 5
SP  - A798-A809
AB  - Gassing in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a serious challenge, especially at high voltage and elevated temperature. In this study, we use On-line Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (OEMS) and a two-compartment cell with a newly developed aluminum edge-seal to elucidate the origin of H-2 evolution in LIBs. We demonstrate that the new sealing is entirely impermeable for gaseous and liquid species, thus allowing us to measure the true H-2 evolution from H2O reduction at a graphite electrode, without interference from the lithium counter-electrode. We further report that graphite//NMC full-cells without any diffusion barrier between anode and cathode show enhanced H-2 generation, especially for high charging potentials and at elevated temperature. We propose that the diffusion of protic electrolyte oxidation species (R-H+) from the cathode to the anode and their subsequent reduction is the origin of enhanced H-2 gassing. To prove this hypothesis, methanesulfonic acid is added to the electrolyte as a chemical source of protons. At the negative graphite electrode, all H+ can be quantitatively reduced to H-2. By the use of the electrolyte additives vinylene carbonate (VC) and lithium bis(oxalato) borate (LiBOB), less H-2 evolution is observed, since the reduction of both H2O and R-H+ is hindered by a more effective SEI on graphite. Finally, we demonstrate that the Al-sealed diffusion barrier between anode and cathode can stop the diffusion of oxidation products to the anode and therefore essentially eliminates the generation of H-2 caused by high cathode potentials.

TI  - Application of predictive degree day model for field development of sandfly vectors of visceral leishmaniasis in northwest of Iran
VL  - 46
IS  - 4
SP  - 247-254
AB  - Background & obiectives: Temperature plays a significant role in insect's development where a rise in temperature, accelerates the insect's metabolic rates, increases egg production and makes blood feeding more frequent. It also shortens the time period required for the development of pathogens within insects. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most important vector-borne diseases transmitted by different sandfly species. In this study, a phenological model was used to estimate the number of generations, peak activity and temporal variability of sandflies in the main VL foci in northwest Iran. Methods: Development requirements of different life stages of a Phlebotomus papatasi laboratory colony were measured and were subjected to the formula for calculation of accumulated degree day (ADD) for field sandflies using the online soft (UC IPM), using horizontal cut-off method and single triangle model. Sandflies population dynamics was monitored in the field during the seasonal activity in the region and its association with the ADD was tested using SAS software. Results: Populations of sandflies accommodated well with the amount of accumulated degree days (ADD) in the region. During the seasonal activity, a total of 639 ADD were produced which was enough to support one complete life cycle and growth of the next generation up to late larval instar. Larvae of the second generation hibernate through winter and the first adult population appears in the mid to late June of the next year when they receive at least 182 ADD from the beginning of the spring. The highest population density of sandflies was observed in early August, followed by a rapid decrease in early September, with the adult population disappearing completely in late September. This is the first degree day model related to sandflies in the most important VL foci of Iran. Interpretation & conclusion: Further studies in various regions with variable climate are recommended in order to better estimate and understand the development time, population dynamics and activities of the vectors which in turn Could be used in proper implementation of effective vector control programmes.

TI  - 60 YEARS OF CORAL REEF FISH ECOLOGY: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE
VL  - 87
IS  - 4
SP  - 727-765
AB  - Revisiting the past 60 yrs of studies of the ecology of fishes on coral reefs reveals successive decadal trends that highlight many lasting contributions relevant to fisheries biology, conservation biology, and ecology in general. The Bulletin of Marine Science was founded in 1951, about the same time SCUBA was first used to study reef fishes, so the 1950s was a decade of initial subtidal exploration by early pioneers. Detailed natural-history investigations of the use of space, food, and time by reef fishes developed in the 1960s, including studies based from undersea habitats late that decade. The 1970s saw the first comprehensive observational studies of reef-fish communities, as well as initial breakthroughs in behavioral ecology, especially regarding cleaning symbiosis, mating systems, and sex reversal. In community ecology, the conventional wisdom that interspecific competition structured reef-fish assemblages via equilibrium dynamics and resource partitioning was called into question by the "lottery hypothesis," which posited that coexistence of ecologically similar species was fostered by nonequilibrial dynamics. The 1980s, in turn, were dominated by debate regarding the relative importance of larval supply vs post-settlement interactions in determining the local abundance and diversity of reef fishes. The "recruitment limitation hypothesis" asserted that larval settlement was so low that subsequent population dynamics were not only unpredictable, but also density-independent. Population and community studies during the 1990s thus focused largely on detecting demographic density dependence in reef-fish populations and identifying the mechanisms underlying this ultimate source of population regulation. From the 1980s to the present, studies of behavioral ecology and interactions between fishes and other reef organisms continued to flourish. Late in the 20th century, it became clear that coral reefs and their fish inhabitants were increasingly threatened, and conservation biology of reef fishes developed as a substantial new subdiscipline. The 2000s comprised the "connectivity" decade as new means of tracking patterns of larval dispersal developed. Knowledge of how larval dispersal connects local populations and/or results in self-recruitment that replenishes a local population is essential for understanding metapopulation dynamics and implementing effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. There is currently a major shift toward conservation biology among many reef-fish ecologists, including studies of the effects of and solutions for overfishing, habitat degradation, invasive species, ocean warming and acidification, and other human-caused environmental challenges. Marine reserves and protected areas are now well documented to be particularly effective at fostering both ecological resilience in general and fisheries sustainability on coral reefs. Future research must necessarily be conservation-based if there are to be any reasonably undisturbed reeffish communities for coming generations of ecologists to study. I personally believe that those of us who have observed the demise of coral reefs first-hand have two major responsibilities: first, conduct basic or applied research indirectly or directly relevant to conservation of reef fishes, and second, speak out as both citizens and scientists to bear witness to these losses, which are largely unseen by the public, and assist managers and policymakers in saving our remaining reefs.

TI  - Rhythm Generation and Rhythm Perception in Insects: The Evolution of Synchronous Choruses
VL  - 10
AB  - Insect sounds dominate the acoustic environment in many natural habitats such as rainforests or meadows on a warm summer day. Among acoustic insects, usually males are the calling sex: they generate signals that transmit information about the species-identity, sex, location, or even sender quality to conspecific receivers. Males of some insect species generate signals at distinct time intervals, and other males adjust their own rhythm relative to that of their conspecific neighbors, which leads to fascinating acoustic group displays. Although signal timing in a chorus can have important consequences for the calling energetics, reproductive success and predation risk of individuals, still little is known about the selective forces that favor the evolution of insect choruses. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the neuronal network responsible for acoustic pattern generation of a signaler, and pattern recognition in receivers. We also describe different proximate mechanisms that facilitate the synchronous generation of signals in a chorus and provide examples of suggested hypotheses to explain the evolution of chorus synchrony in insects. Some hypotheses are related to sexual selection and inter-male cooperation or competition, whereas others refer to the selection pressure exerted by natural predators. In this article, we summarize the results of studies that address chorus synchrony in the tropical katydid Mecopoda elongata, where some males persistently signal as followers although this reduces their mating success.

TI  - Importance of Magmatic Water Content and Oxidation State for Porphyry-Style Au Mineralization: An Example from the Giant Beiya Au Deposit, SW China
VL  - 8
IS  - 10
AB  - The Beiya Au deposit is the largest Cenozoic Au deposit in the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan porphyry metallogenic belt. Numerous studies document that high water content and fO(2) are vital factors for the generation of Au mineralization. In this belt, only the Wandongshan and Hongnitang districts are considered to be of economic importance, while the other districts, such as Bailiancun, are barren. So in order to reveal the importance of water content and oxidation state for Beiya porphyry-style Au mineralization, the amphiboles and zircons compositions are used to evaluate the physicochemical conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, fO(2), and water content) of the Wandongshan ore-fertile porphyries and Bailiancun ore-barren porphyries observed in the Beiya Au deposit. The results show that the water content of the Wandongshan parent magma (<= 4.11 0.4 wt %) are slightly higher than those of the parent magma at Bailiancun (<= 3.91 0.4 wt %), while the emplacement pressure of the Wandongshan parent magma (31.5-68.6 MPa) is much lower than that of the parent magma at Bailiancun (142.3-192.8 MPa), indicating that the Wandongshan magma reached water saturation earlier. In addition, the Wandongshan porphyries crystallized from more oxidized magma (average of Delta FMQ = +3.5) with an average temperature of 778 degrees C compared to the Bailiancun porphyries (average of Delta FMQ = +1.5) with a mean magmatic temperature of 770 degrees C. The Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio of zircon in the Wandongshan ore-related intrusions (average Ce4+/Ce3+ of 62.00) is much higher than that of the Bailiancun barren porphyries (average Ce4+/Ce3+ of 23.15), which further confirmed Wandongshan ore-related magma is more oxidized than the Bailiancun barren magma. Therefore, melts that are more enriched in water and with a high oxidation state will be more fertile to form an economic porphyry-style Au system.

VL  - 58
IS  - 3
SP  - 199-210
AB  - The anthropometric somatotype is a quantitative description of body shape and composition. Familial studies indicate the existence of a familial resemblance for this phenotype and they suggest a substantial action by genetic factors on this aggregation. The aim of this study is to examine the degree of familial resemblance of the somatotype components and of a factor of shape, in a sample of Biscay nuclear families (Basque Country, Spain). One thousand three hundred and thirty nuclear families were analysed. The anthropornetric somatotype components [Carter, J.E.L., Heath, B.H., 1990. Somatotyping. Development and applications. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 503] were computed. Each component was fitted for the other two through a stepwise multiple regression, and also fitted through the LMS method [Cole, T., 1988. Fitting smoothed centile curves to reference data. J. Roy. Stat. Soc. 151, 385-418] in order to eliminate the age, sex and generation effects. The three raw components were introduced in a PCA from which a shape factor (PCI) was extracted for each generation. The correlations analysis was performed with the SEGPATH package [Province, M.A., Rao, D.C., 1995. General purpose model and computer programme for combined segregation and path analysis (SEGPATH): automatically creating computer from symbolic language model specifications. Genet. Epidemiol. 12, 203-219]. A general model of transmission and nine reduced models were tested. Maximal heritability was estimated with the formula of [Rice, T., Warwick, D.E., Gagnon, J., Bouchard, C., Leon, A.S.,Skinner, J.S., Wilmore, J.H., Rao, D.C., 1997. Familial resemblance for body composition measures: the HERITAGE family study. Obes. Res. 5, 557-562]. The correlations were higher between offspring than in parents and offspring and a significant resemblance between mating partners existed. Maximum heritabilities were 55%, 52% and 46% for endomorphy, mesomorphy and ectomorphy, respectively, and 52% for PCI. In conclusion, the somatotype presents a moderate degree of familial aggregation. For the somatotype components, as well as for PCI, the degree of familial resemblance depends on age. The sex only has a significant effect on ectomorphy. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clarke (1987; Mar Ecol Frog Ser 38:89-99) analysed the effects of variation in maintenance metabolic costs with temperature on reproductive metabolism in poikilothermic animals. Based on model calculations, he concluded that annual mass-specific gonad production (GP) and the share of assimilated energy used for reproductive purposes (RE) are affected in opposite ways by temperature. In animals of similar size and ecology either GP will decrease with decreasing temperature ii RE remains constant or RE will increase with decreasing temperature if GP remains constant. Empirical data on productivity of marine benthic invertebrate populations suggest that the evolutionary adaptation of gonad metabolism tends toward changing GP and maintaining RE independent of temperature.

TI  - Within species expressed genetic variability and gene expression response to different temperatures in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus sensu stricto
VL  - 14
IS  - 9
AB  - Genetic divergence is impacted by many factors, including phylogenetic history, gene flow, genetic drift, and divergent selection. Rotifers are an important component of aquatic ecosystems, and genetic variation is essential to their ongoing adaptive diversification and local adaptation. In addition to coding sequence divergence, variation in gene expression may relate to variable heat tolerance, and can impose ecological barriers within species. Temperature plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by affecting species abundance, spatio-temporal distribution, and habitat colonization. Recently described (formerly cryptic) species of the Brachionus calyciflorus complex exhibit different temperature tolerance both in natural and in laboratory studies, and show that B. calyciflorus sensu stricto (s.s.) is a thermotolerant species. Even within B. calyciflorus s.s., there is a tendency for further temperature specializations. Comparison of expressed genes allows us to assess the impact of stressors on both expression and sequence divergence among disparate populations within a single species. Here, we have used RNA-seq to explore expressed genetic diversity in B. calyciflorus s.s. in two mitochondrial DNA lineages with different phylogenetic histories and differences in thermotolerance. We identify a suite of candidate genes that may underlie local adaptation, with a particular focus on the response to sustained high or low temperatures. We do not find adaptive divergence in established candidate genes for thermal adaptation. Rather, we detect divergent selection among our two lineages in genes related to metabolism (lipid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics).

VL  - 146
IS  - 2
SP  - 223-240
AB  - The composition and thermal state of the lithospheric mantle under the North Atlantic craton was investigated using a suite of peridotite xenoliths from the diamond-bearing Sarfartoq kimberlite dike swarm of southwestern Greenland. Elevated olivine and whole-rock Mg# (>0.9) attest to the refractory nature of the Sarfartoq mantle showing comparable degrees of depletion to other cratonic roots. Modal analyses indicate that the Sarfartoq mantle is not typified by the orthopyroxene enrichment observed in the Kaapvaal root, but shows more affinity with the Canadian Arctic (Somerset Island), Tanzania, and East Greenland (Wiedemann Fjord) peridotites. The Sarfartoq peridotites have equilibrated at temperatures and pressures ranging from 660 to 1,280 degreesC and from 2.2 to 6.3 GPa, and define a relatively low mantle heat flow of 13.2+/-1 mW/m(2.) In addition, the lithospheric mantle underneath the Sarfartoq area is compositionally layered as follows: (1) an internally stratified upper layer (70 to 180 km) consisting of coarse, un-deformed, refractory garnet-bearing and garnet-free peridotites and, (2) a lower layer (180 to 225 km) characterized by fertile, CPX-bearing, porphyroclastic garnet lherzolites. The stratification observed in the upper refractory harzburgite layer (70-180 km) is reflected by an increase in fertility (e.g., decrease in olivine abundance and forsterite content) with depth. The sharp nature of the boundary between the upper and lower layers may indicate multistage growth of the lithospheric mantle.

TI  - Simple Analysis of the Application of Smart Coatings in Wall Painting
SP  - 488-491
AB  - With the development of smart materials, smart coatings have attracted extensive attentions in all works of life and have been gradually put into use in all fields. "These coatings, adopting a controllable and reproduction way to feel and respond to the surroundings, are able to make relevant changes in temperature, colors, sound, light, etc."(Lin & Sun 2009). This paper studies the application of smart coatings in wall painting, and tries to benefit wall paintings with new functions, environmental adaptability and stronger self-regulation ability that are not possessed by traditional coatings to achieve an ecological and intelligent development of wall paintings. With the quickened pace of environmental protection and energy saving, smart coatings, as a new product in painting industry that can be widely used, have arisen much concern. It has not only been used in high-tech fields, but also made appearance in the surrounding areas. Smart coatings are now used in wall painting, a newly- developed field, which can be beneficially provided with new functions and richened forms and contents that can be not brought about by the traditional materials.

TI  - Life cycle, seasonal vertical distribution and feeding of Calanus finmarchicus in Skagerrak coastal water
VL  - 137
IS  - 2
SP  - 279-289
AB  - Day/night zooplankton sampling in Kosterfjorden, Sweden, gave information on population succession, vertical distribution and feeding df Calanus finmarchicus over 17 months. Copepodid Stage 1 and 2 (C-I, C-II) were present from December to August, indicating reproduction during most of the year. Mating and breeding for the overwintering generation mainly took place in February/March, resulting in peak abundance of C-I in March/April. Secondary breeding periods were in April and July/August, but the resulting recruitment from these were low. The relative recruitment success in the first spring was around 13 times higher than during the second spring. Low temperature in the surface water early in the year and depression of the spring phytoplankton bloom may have caused the failure in the second year. Population biomass peaked at >15 g dry weight m(-2) during the numeric peak of the youngest stages in March/April. A more sustainable level of high biomass of 8 to 10 g dw m(-2) was gradually built up during summer, mainly due to a continuous accumulation of C-Vs. Adults and C-Vs comprised the overwintering population, with 7 to 14% and 85 to 93%, respectively, for the 2 years, but only C-Vs staying in the deep water were in a resting state. Adult males showed a strong diurnal vertical migration (DVM) of the usual type from spring to early autumn and a reversed DVM during the cold season. They were in a feeding state throughout the year. Adult females showed the usual type of DVM during summer to autumn, but commonly a reversed DVM during winter to spring. They were usually in a feeding state, with no pronounced differences between surface and deep water or between day and night. C-Vs aggregated in the deep water from October to March and performed DVM in April to June. They were commonly feeding in the deep water between March and June but showed no or very low feeding activity there from July to February. C-Vs in the surface water were commonly feeding and showed the highest proportion of feeding in autumn, when the population in the deep water was inactive. C-V constituted up to nearly 100% of the population biomass, and therefore must be of profound ecological importance. Defined by this dominant role, the population of C. finmarchicus can be characterised as having an active period of feeding, reproduction and development from February to July with a following 6 to 7 months of resting in the deep water, when development is arrested and no feeding occurs.

TI  - CAN BIOMASS TRIGGER AN ENERGY WISE TRANSITION IN CROATIA AND REST OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE?
VL  - 139
IS  - 11
SP  - 561-569
AB  - Through the history of mankind, until the mid-19th century, biomass, particularly wood, represented the most important source of energy. In many countries of Europe, the awareness of the importance of forest biomass as fuel has been closely connected to the general understanding and the realization of own and world energetic situation. Forest biomass represents an important source of energy, whose use should be paid more attention to in the future. In its traditional forms, biomass is still a very significant source of energy in most countries of the southeast Europe and it will continue to be so in the near future. However, it is more and more used not just for thermal energy production, but also for the production of electric and cooling energy which is considered as an important part of the energetic transition which is a promising model with high economic and ecological advantages. The use of biomass energy offers significant possibilities for opening new jobs, thus having a significant positive impact on the local and national economy. This paper describes the present stage of the energetic transition in the south-eastern European countries and the role of forest biomass in its implementation. Examples and events in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia are analysed. Rural development projects as well as the use of bioenergy biomass has a great potential for income generation, increase of productivity and opening of small village companies. From the macroeconomic perspective, the use of biomass contributes to all the important elements in the development of the south-eastern European countries. Key drivers as well as the obstacles which can be encountered in the energetic transition in local government units can be structured as follows; potential stimulus, refers to the most south-eastern European countries regarding their significant afforestation and forest biomass potential, market stimulus due to cost-effective accessible plants and equipment for biomass, as well as the adequate support of manufacturing firms, the use of commercial and business connections: where most of biomass trades among the south-eastern European countries and EU is carried out in integration with the forest product trade, to be first or the local pride, is an important driver in the south-eastern European countries to keep money at home is another important link with the positive perception in the use of the forest biomass. The paper recognised a significant number of potential groups of obstacles for using the forest biomass; economic limitations more favourable price of the forest biomass energy in relation to fossil fuels, financial limitations as a serious obstacle for each form of the renewable energy, social limitations are very specific for each form of the renewable energy, human resource limitations since most local governments do not have sufficient human potential, limitations due to transparency are a very frequent problem, primarily depends on the democratic power, technical limitations mostly belong to the fact that most of the equipment for using renewable energy sources and the increase in energetic efficiency from the import, has not been produced on the local level.

TI  - Use of a Common Garden Experiment in Selecting Adapted Beech Provenances for Artificial Stand Restoration
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-10
AB  - Increased frequency of extreme weather events has seriously affected forestry operations in south-eastern Europe. A precondition for effective artificial restoration of disturbed forest stands is site-adapted forest reproductive material (FRM). Common garden experiments (provenance trials) may assist in selecting such FRM. The main objective of this study was to establish among-provenance variation pattern using data from a beech provenance trial. Usefulness of the results in selecting seed sources for restoration of European beech stands is discussed. The trial was set up in 2007, at a slope of Medvednica mount facing north-west at 730-750 m above sea level. Plant heights were measured and survival scored in 2008 and 2015. Height increments were calculated and processed to determine variance components due to various effects. Highly significant provenance-by-block interaction was revealed, indicating strong microsite effects on provenance performances. Therefore, corrections were made and provenance mean height increments recalculated. Provenance mean height increment multiplied with survival was used as a measure of a provenance's adaptedness. Regression tree (RT) analysis was used to determine the pattern of among-provenance variations. A set of provenance dusters was grown using climatic variables related to the provenance stands of origin as criteria. All analyzed effects were significant (provenance: F=2.07, p<0.05; block: F=5.07, p<0.05; provenance by block interaction: F=7.32, p<0.001). Data corrections reduced the interaction effect, thereby increasing reliability of calculated provenance adaptedness indices (AI). Provenances were grouped into 4 clusters due to elevation, mean July temperature and summer heat-to-moisture index (SHM). Cluster 4, containing provenances from the highest altitudes (>750m), had the highest mean AI (143.9 +/- 8.4 cm). The lowest mean AI(106.7 +/- 14.8 cm) had cluster 1, containing provenances from lower altitudes with lower mean July temperatures (<= 1.8.4 degrees C). Provenances originating from lower elevations with higher mean July temperatures (>18.4 degrees C) were further divided into two clusters due to the SHM variable. Cluster 2 had the second highest mean AI (141.2 +/- 1.5 cm) and contained provenances from relatively wetter habitats (SHM <= 48.2). Cluster 3, containing provenances from relatively arid habitats (SHM>48.2), had significantly lower mean AI (116.8 +/- 8.6 cm). Established among-provenance variation pattern might be used as a tool in selecting seed sources for artificial restoration of beech stands at mount Medvednica. It is advisable to use FRM from higher altitudes and/or from slightly lower altitudes (up to 150 m lower than a restoring site) but featured with warmer and drier conditions compared to the trial. Generally, provenance trials should be utilized as a valuable decision tool in restoring disturbed forest stands but may also be misleading if not well designed and analyzed.

TI  - Spawning stock fluctuations and recruitment variability related to temperature for selected herring (Clupea harengus) stocks in the North Atlantic
VL  - 18
SP  - 315-334
AB  - Fish stocks vary in abundance, and assessments show that exploitation has a large effect on stock size fluctuations. The effect of the physical environment on stock fluctuations is not well understood. In this paper, the main purpose is to shed light on the relationship between the temperature in surrounding water-masses and the fluctuations in spawning stock biomass and recruitment to herring stocks in the North Atlantic. A feature that may indicate the influence of external factors is the coherence or common pattern in the fluctuations in the abundance of herring stocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Time series of normalized spawning stock size were compared between five herring stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean. Common patterns in stock biomass were found between several of the stocks. A significant relationship was found between recruitment and temperature for Norwegian spring spawners only. North Sea herring, Icelandic summer spawners, and herring in the Bay of Fundy also had a pattern of enhanced recruitment at higher temperatures. Although it is found that herring stocks inhabiting warmer waters have a higher stock-recruitment relationship than the stocks inhabiting colder regions, it is believed that the temperature is a proxy for other environmental factors influencing the survival of larvae and hence the level of recruitment.

VL  - 40

SP  - 690-696
AB  - We determined the influence of fruit maturity on the killing effectiveness of electron beam irradiation using model foods systems resembling melons. The model systems consisted of mixtures of 100 g/l of unflavored gelatin and sugars at three ratios (fructose : glucose : sucrose) and levels designated as early ripe, ER, 3.0 g/l, 1.5:1.5:0; moderately ripe, MR, 5.5 g/l, 1: 1: 1.0 and ripe, R, 8.0 g/l, 0.5:0.5:2.0. The model systems were inoculated with the surrogate Escherichia coli K-12 MG 1655, irradiated at 1.0 kGy using a 2.0 MeV Van de Graaf accelerator, and stored at 4 degrees C for 4 days. Both non-irradiated gelatin systems and non-sugar systems served as controls. Independent of irradiation, the surrogate population increased slightly in the ripe systems while it decreased in the ER systems. The effect of storage temperature on the surrogate's ability to recover was tested using MR samples (irradiated and non-irradiated) stored at 10 and 20 degrees C for 4 days. A non-sugar system served as control. At these two temperatures, the populations recovered back to their initial numbers after 48h of storage. Generation times increased with fruit maturity level (1.3-1.6h) and population counts ranged from -0.6 to 1.0log(10) CFU/ml for ER and MR systems after 60 h of storage at 20 degrees C, respectively. The number of injured populations was 0.5 log(10) CFU/ml. To prevent recovery of bacteria populations after electron beam irradiation treatments at 1.0 kGy, storage at low temperature (4 degrees C) is recommended.

TI  - Multiple Data Demonstrate That Bacteria Regulating Reproduction Could Be Not the Cause for the Thelytoky of Diglyphus wani (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Simple Summary In Hymenoptera, some species have two reproduction modes, that is, arrhenotokous and thelytokous parthenogenesis. Although arrhenotoky is common, the thelytoky is not rare. Thelytoky in Hymenopteran species has several causes and is generally induced by bacteria. Here, we examined a thelytokous Chalcidoidea parasitoid, Diglyphus wani, which was recently reported to be a dominant parasitoid attacking agromyzid leafminers. In this study, we aimed to combine multiple methods to explore whether endosymbionts induce thelytokous D. wani. Our findings revealed that the thelytoky of D. wani was not to be associated with the actual presence of the endosymbionts. Thus, Diglyphus wani is the second reported eulophid parasitoid for which thelytoky is not linked with the presence of endosymbionts. In Hymenoptera parasitoids, the reproductive mode is arrhenotoky, while a few species reproduce by thelytoky. The thelytoky of Hymenoptera parasitoids is generally genetically determined by the parasitoids themselves or induced by bacteria, including Wolbachia, Cardinium, and Rickettsia. Diglyphus wani (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a recently reported thelytokous species is a main parasitoid attacking agromyzid leafminers. To assess whether endosymbionts induce thelytoky in D. wani, we performed universal PCR detection and sequenced the V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA gene. In addition, bacteria were removed through high-temperature and antibiotic treatments, and the localized bacteria were detected using FISH. Based on general PCR detection, Wolbachia, Cardinium, Rickettsia, Arsenophonus, Spiroplasma, and Microsporidia were absent in laboratory and field individuals of thelytokous D. wani. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the dominant endosymbionts in thelytokous D. wani were not reproductive manipulators. High-temperature and antibiotic treatment for five consecutive generations cannot reverse the thelytokous pattern of D. wani, and no male offspring were produced. Moreover, no bacterial spots were found in the ovaries of D. wani. Thus, it is considered that the thelytoky of D. wani does not result in the presence of endosymbionts. This species is thus the second reported eulophid parasitoid whose thelytoky appears not to be associated with endosymbionts.

TI  - Effect of climate change on the potential spread of the Colorado potato beetle in Scandinavia: an ensemble approach
VL  - 62
IS  - 1
SP  - 15-24
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata is an insect pest that can cause a substantial reduction of the potato harvest if left uncontrolled. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a warmer climate on the Colorado potato beetle in Europe, since temperature influences the beetles' activity and development from egg to adult, and thereby the potential distribution. The study focuses in particular on the potential northward spread in the Scandinavian countries. In this region, the current climate is not warm enough to sustain the completed development of one generation in all years, and the region does not host a permanent population. Temperature data for 1961-2050 from 4 regional climate models and gridded observed data for 1961-1990 (reference period) were used for model calculations. We simulated the earliest timing of completed development of the first and second generations of the Colorado potato beetle, and assessed the geographical and inter-annual variation in the number of generations per year. The model simulations indicated a shift in the northern limit for establishment of a permanent Colorado potato beetle population by 2020-2050 in comparison with 1961-1990. In particular, the model showed a substantial increase in the frequency of years in which the temperature requirement for development of one generation was fulfilled in the transient zone, i.e. the southern part of Scandinavia. In addition, 2 generations per year may occur more frequently at the current distribution border at 55 degrees N, increasing the risk of northward migration to the Scandinavian countries.

TI  - Beyond energy savings: Investigating the co-benefits of heat resilient architecture
VL  - 204
AB  - Heat is a growing concern in cities around the word, especially in the face of climate change. Because buildings are an important component of the built environment vis-a-vis both energy use and heat resiliency in cities, we explored their climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Specifically, we investigated how design decisions interact with regard to three heat-related factors-namely, energy use/CO2 emissions, passive survivability, and heat rejection to the urban climate. We selected an archetypical building as our test case, created various design permutations, and used whole-building simulations to analyze their performance. Our simulations show that permutations of the building with a smaller carbon footprint also emit less heat to ambient air and had a better passive survivability. However, we also noted potential trade-offs (e.g., where ventilation is inadequate, increasing insulation levels for energy efficiency may hurt passive survivability). Based on our findings, we argue that, at least at a policy level, it is imperative to take advantage of the synergies, and their collective benefits. Moreover, building regulations or incentive programs should look beyond energy as the sole performance metric of interest and consider passive survivability as well as thermal interactions with urban climate.

TI  - Ingestion rates of Artemia nauplii for different larval stages of Macrobrachium rosenbergii
VL  - 217
IS  - 1
SP  - 223-233
AB  - The functional response between ingestion rate and food concentration was determined for each larval stage of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Artemia franciscana nauplii were supplied at 2,4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 per milliliter. The nauplii were counted by sight using a Pasteur pipette and transferred to Petri dishes containing 40 ml of brackish water (12 parts per thousand) lying on the top of black plastic. One larva at each stage was individually placed into each Petri dish containing different food density. After 24 h, each larva was removed from the Petri dish and the leftover nauplii were counted. The amount consumed was determined by the difference between the initial and final number of nauplii. Ingestion rate (I) increased as food density (P) increased and was defined by the model I=I-m(1-e(-kP)). The results suggest four levels of ingestion during larval development. The first level includes stages II, III and IV, with average maximum consumption of about 40 nauplii/day; the second level includes stages V and VI, with consumption of approximately 55 nauplii/day; the third level includes stages VII and VIII, with consumption of 80-100 nauplii/day. The fourth level includes stages IX, X and XI, in which the high values for maximum ingestion (Im) exceed the load capacity of the medium. The low values for constant k (that may correspond to the adaptability of the food to prey characteristics, such as, size, mobility, etc.) obtained for stages IX, X and XI indicated that Artemia is not an adequate prey and there is necessity of a supplementary diet. The best relationship between predator and prey seemed to occur during stage IV Results obtained in the present work may subsidize future researches and serve as a guideline for practical considerations of feeding rates.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Eco-physiological and physiological characteristics are used to study native rhizobial species for their ecological and physiological adaptability to different conditions. This study aimed to assess the eco-physiological and physiological characteristics of cowpea-nodulating rhizobia isolated from major production areas of Ethiopia. Twenty-eight isolates were isolated from cowpea root nodules and evaluated for different eco-physiological and physiological characteristics. All tested isolates grew within a temperature range of 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. All isolates were able to grow at pH values of between 6.0 and 8.5, with optimal growth at pH around neutral. All isolates were tolerant of NaCl concentration ranging from 0.1% to 1%. The growth of isolates decreased as the salt concentration increased. The tested isolates were able to grow on different carbon sources, such as glucose (100%), fructose (100%) glycerol (100%), mannose (96.43%), lactose (96.43%), galactose (85.71%), arabinose (60.71%) and maltose (46.43%) showing that the majority of tested rhizobia were able to use a broad range of carbohydrates as sole carbon sources. Similarly, the isolates were able to grow on L-lysine (89.29%), L-arginine (92.86%), tyrosine (82.14%), L-tryptophan (89.29%), L-asparagine (78.57%), methionine (75%) and glutamate (85.71%) as a source of amino acids. The tested isolates showed a wide diversity for their tolerance to different eco-physiological conditions (temperature, pH and salt concentration) and had the ability to utilize a large variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. The variation and diversity of tolerance to different ecological conditions and utilization of different nutrients would provide them an ecological advantage and enhance their chance for survival.

TI  - Annual population development and production by Calanus finmarchicus, C-glacialis and C-hyperboreus in Disko Bay, western Greenland
VL  - 139
IS  - 1
SP  - 75-93
AB  - The populations of the copepod species Calanits finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus were investigated in Disko Bay during a 14-month period in 1996-1997. The three species were predominant in the copepod community. The biomass reached a maximum at the beginning of June (127 mg C m(-3)). From the end of July until the end of April the following year, the biomass was <1-6 mg C m-3. All three species showed seasonal ontogenetic migration. The spring ascent for all three species was just prior to or in association with the break-up of sea ice and the development of the spring bloom, whereas descent occurred over a larger time span during summer. The main overwintering stages were CV for C. finmarchicus, CIV and CV for C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus. Peak abundance of juvenile copepodites, representing the new generation, was in August for C. finmarchicus, in July for C. glacialis and in May/June for C. hyperboreus. From the timing of reproduction and the population development, the life cycles were deduced to be 1 year for C. finmarchicus and at least 2 years for C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus. Secondary production and potential grazing impact of the Calanus community were estimated by two methods based on specific egg-production rates and temperature-dependent production. The Calanus community was not able to control the primary producers during the spring bloom but probably did during postbloom. The estimates also indicated that grazing on ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates contributes as an essential food source in the post-bloom period.

TI  - Interval Model Control of Consumable Double-Electrode Gas Metal Arc Welding Process
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SP  - 826-839
AB  - This application paper concerns the modeling and control of an innovative welding process, namely, the Consumable Double-Electrode Gas Metal Arc Welding. This innovative process can dramatically increase welding productivity and reduce weld distortion. It has demonstrated the feasibility to double the travel speed for automatic welding but requires controls to realize its unique advantages. To reach this goal, the bypass voltage and base metal current were selected as process outputs to be controlled. The bypass current and main wire feed speed were selected as the inputs and the control system was reduced to two single-input-single-output (SISO) subsystems for convenient implementation and design. Physical analysis and derivation show that these subsystems can be approximated as first-order model systems but their parameters depend on manufacturing conditions. Hence, they were described using first-order interval models whose parameters are unknown but bounded by known intervals. Step response experiments were conducted with selected range of manufacturing conditions to identify a few models for each of the subsystems. These models were then used to derive two interval models. To increase the stability margin, the intervals identified were artificially enlarged. Finally, a prediction-based interval model control algorithm was used to control the resultant interval models and closed-loop control experiments verified the effectiveness of the developed control system. Note to Practitioners-Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is the most widely used arc welding process. However, its current melting the wire is the same as the current heating the base metal. Increasing the melting speed for higher productivity proportionally increases the base metal heat input resulting in increased distortion. To resolve this problem, the authors proposed a simple way to modify the GMAW process such that the base metal current is independent from the melting current. The melting speed can thus be increased, while the base metal heat input and resultant distortion are still controlled at given desirable levels. This modified process, referred to as the double-electrode GMAW or DE-GMAW, has been proved to be capable of doubling the travel speed for automobile welding. However, it is more complex than GMAW and requires appropriate controls to achieve its claimed advantages. This paper is devoted to the modeling and control of this innovative process.

TI  - DOES THE AUTECOLOGY OF THE MANGROVE RIVULUS FISH (RIVULUS-MARMORATUS) REFLECT A PARADIGM FOR MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM SENSITIVITY
VL  - 57
IS  - 1
SP  - 208-214
AB  - The killifish Rivulus marmoratus, mangrove rivulus, represents the one of the two potentially truly ''mangrove dependent'' fish species in western Atlantic mangrove ecosystems. The distribution of this species closely parallels the range of red mangroves. These plants and fish exhibit parallel ecological and physiological tolerances to the wide ranges of tropical temperatures and salinities, as well as substrate and hydrological conditions of mangrove habitats. The mangrove rivulus, R. marmoratus, is, as well, the only truly marine representative of a speciose genus of otherwise freshwater fish species. Many of the biological specializations of this species characterize the specific challenges to survival in mangrove forest conditions. As recent studies report, this fish species, once considered ''rare,'' has been shown to be very abundant in specific substrate microhabitats of the mangal. Among the unique specializations of this fish are amphibious emersion from water, survival in moist detrital substrate during periods of low water or drought, and reproduction through internal self-fertilization producing homozygous clones. The autecology of this species provides fascinating insights and generates a wealth of questions regarding evolution of specific adaptations for distribution, dispersal, colonization, population genetics and the interrelationships between adaptation and specialization. The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) represents both the site of rediscovery of the fish as well as the northern frontier of the species distribution range, habitat, and ecosystem. This suggests close interrelationships and parallels in the parameters to which the species has adapted, perhaps representing a commonage, of ecological association. These aspects are discussed with respect to details and insight needed to develop strategies for the management of unique communities and ecosystems, especially along their natural distributional borders. The topic raises such questions as: Are some ''exotic species'' actually examples of newly arrived colonizers, representing dynamic biotic responses to climate change and/or anthropogenic habitat modification?

TI  - A sustainability framework for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technologies
VL  - 114
SP  - 6044-6056
AB  - Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) involves the conversion of biomass to energy, producing CO2 which is sequestered, transported and then permanently stored in a suitable geological formation. Thus, a negative flow of CO2 from the atmosphere to the subsurface is established. The potential of BECCS to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (in addition to generating energy) makes it an attractive approach to help achieving the ambitious global warming targets of COP 21. BECCS has a range of variables such as the type of biomass resource, the conversion technology, the CO(2)capture process used and storage options. Each of the pathways to connect these options has its own environmental, economic and social impacts. This study attempts to integrate these impacts into a three pillar sustainability framework (3PSF) approach. As an example, the 3PSF approach is applied to bioenergy from organic waste collected from municipal solid waste (MSW). Global and Australian potentials for using municipal solid waste as resource for bioenergy and coupling it with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), was investigated. Two BECCS systems, municipal solid waste incineration with carbon capture and storage (MSW-CCS) and landfill gas combusted in gas turbine with carbon capture and storage (LFG-CCS) were modelled. In the case of business-asusual scenarios with no emission policy in place, the cost of electricity from both BECCS options is higher than for unmitigated coal power generation. However, introducing renewable energy certificate or negative emission refunding schemes has a significant impact on the economic viability of these technologies. Environmental impact assessments show that in the MSW-CCS model, for each kg of wet MSW incinerated around 0.7 kg CO2, eq is removed from the atmosphere.

TI  - Modeling of current and future energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions of the Lebanese industrial sector: assessment of mitigation options
VL  - 63
IS  - 1
SP  - 53-74
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions in Lebanon mainly come from energy activities, which are responsible for 85% of all CO2 emissions. The CO2-emissions from energy use in manufacturing industries and construction represent 24% of the total emissions of the energy sector. Lebanese manufacturers' accounted for 39.15 million gigajoules of fuel consumption for heat and power generation in 1994, including both fuel used directly and fuel burned remotely to generate electricity used in the sector. In addition to being processed by combustion, CO2 is generated in calcining of carbonates in the manufacture of cement, iron and glass. Electricity, the most expensive form of energy, represented 25.87% of all fuel used for heat and power. Residual fuel oil and diesel, which are used mainly in direct combustion processes, represent 26.85 and 26.55% of all energy use by industry, respectively. Scenarios for future energy use and CO2 emissions are developed for the industrial sector in Lebanon. The development of the baseline scenario relied on available data on major plants' outputs, and on reported amounts of fuels used by the industrial sector as a whole. Energy use in industry and the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Lebanon are projected in baseline scenarios that reflect technologies, activities and practices that are likely to evolve from the base year 1994 to year 2040, Mitigation work targets a 15% of CO2 emissions from the baseline scenario by year 2005 and a 20-30% reduction of CO2 emissions by year 2040. The mitigation options selected for analysis are screened on the basis of GHG emissions and expert judgement on the viability of their wide-scale implementation and economic benefits. Using macroeconomic assessment and energy price assumptions, the final estimates of potential GHG emissions and reduction costs of various mitigation scenarios are calculated. The results show that the use of efficient electric motors, efficient boilers and furnaces with fuel switching from fuel oil to natural gas has the largest impact on GHG emissions at a levelized annual cost that ranges from -20 to -5 US$/tonne of CO2 reduced. The negative costs are indicative of direct savings obtained in energy cost for those mitigation options. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Artemia franciscana Cysts to Improve Diets for Mass Rearing Stethorus gilvifrons, a Predator of Tetranychus turkestani
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
AB  - Simple Summary The ladybird beetle Stethorus gilvifrons is a native predator of spider mites in the Mediterranean region that could be mass-reared and released to control spider mite populations on crop plants. The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that brine shrimp cysts can improve diets for mass rearing of S. gilvifrons in the absence of prey, i.e., spider mites. The diet treatments included brine shrimp cysts alone (D1), brine shrimp cysts plus a vitamin B complex (D2), brine shrimp cysts plus date palm pollen (D3), or brine shrimp cysts plus date palm pollen and Mediterranean flour moth eggs (D4). The results revealed that only two diets, D3 and D4, supported predator development to the adult stage and reproduction. The predator reproductive rate and life table estimates indicated that D4 was superior. In conclusion, only a mixed diet of brine shrimp cysts, date palm pollen, and flour moth eggs is suitable for mass rearing S. gilvifrons. Stethorus gilvifrons is an acarophagous coccinellid distributed in the Mediterranean region and could potentially be mass-reared for the augmentative biological control of Tetranychus turkestani and related species on crop plants. The hypothesis that brine shrimp Artemia franciscana cysts can improve diets for rearing of S. gilvifrons was tested in laboratory experiments. The diet treatments included A. franciscana cysts (D1), A. franciscana cysts plus a vitamin B complex (D2), A. franciscana cysts plus date palm pollen (D3), and A. franciscana cysts plus date palm pollen and Ephestia kuehniella eggs (D4). The results indicated that D1 did not support immature development. D2 supported egg-larval development but not pupal-adult development. Both D3 and D4 supported development to the adult stage and reproduction. However, D4 was the most effective diet, determined by observations of S. gilvifrons oviposition behavior and fecundity. A life table analysis corroborated these results; an intrinsic rate of increase, net and gross reproductive rates, and mean generation time were best for S. gilvifrons fed D4 rather than D3. A mixed diet composed of A. franciscana cysts, date palm pollen, and E. kuehniella eggs can be used to mass rear S. gilvifrons.

TI  - Design and manufacturing of an inductive liquid food heat treatment-filling system
VL  - 46
IS  - 4
AB  - In this study, an inductive heat treatment-filling system for milk pasteurization was designed and constructed. To identify the design parameters of the system, basic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and lethality (reduction of a target pathogen during heating or thermal destruction of microorganisms) analyses were carried out simultaneously. In this context, the temperature-time combination of heated milk related to pipe design was taken into consideration. Induction calculations were made to provide the necessary heating for the selected flow rate and pipe construction material and diameter. Required frequency, power, and optimum coil design for the system were identified and validated. In the study, analyses were made for three different temperatures (90, 120, 150 degrees C) with different designs (straight pipe, flow breaker blades on the surface, central shaft) to define the required pipe length to obtain milk temperature (85 degrees C). Pipe dimensions were evaluated by CFD design and the shortest pipe length was 540 mm for the pipe having surface modification at 150 degrees C. However, for simplicity and applicability, a straight pipe at 90 degrees C constant surface temperature was selected for prototyping. From lethality calculations, 80 degrees C outlet temperature for 2700 mm pipe length was found to be sufficient and these parameters were considered for calculating induction parameters such as coil design and induction power. Experimental validation showed that heat balance was achieved compared to CFD calculations for the given system in steady condition; however, 130 s is required for reaching steady condition and this gap can be considered as come-up time. Although heat provided by induction was sufficient to heat milk to the desired temperature at the given pipe length, time was needed to heat the pipe to 90 degrees C with 25 degrees C milk passing inside at 1 L/s capacity.

TI  - Computer simulation of hot rolling of steel
SP  - 381-388
AB  - Thermal and microstructural evolution during hot rolling of low carbon steel in a continuous six stand mill are simulated with a two-dimensional finite difference model. The cross-sectional area of the strip is divided into small elements of equal volume in order to evaluate heat conduction within it. It is assumed that the heat transfer coefficients at the surface of the strip change as the strip is on air, or is being descaled or deformed. Results from the microstructural modelling indicate that the austenite is able to recrystallize dynamically when the conditions within the roil-gap are propitious. The model also allows for the occurrence of metadynamic and static recrystallization, once the material leaves the gap, and for grain growth after their completion. The thermal portion of the model is validated with measurements conducted on the mill being simulated, Although it is not possible to do the same with the microstructural portion, inclusion of their kinetics has allowed the reproduction of rolling loads during actual production.

TI  - Measurements of hurricane induced high-frequency currents
AB  - Hurricanes are powerful, energetic storms that can be fueled by warm ocean waters, while simultaneously driving transport and mixing under their path. Wind-driven mixing is an important mechanism for generating internal waves, and hurricanes are capable of generating particularly high levels of mixing. The internal waves in turn allow diapycnal mixing in the ocean, accelerating heat transfer from the near surface to deeper waters. This plays a role in global thermohaline circulation, affecting heat transfer and therefore density properties throughout the oceans. However, while the importance of internal waves is well established, direct measurements of hurricane-generated internal waves over the shelf and slope regions are scarce. As a result, the mechanisms for the generation of these waves by storms are poorly understood. Here we examine the high frequency response and generation of internal waves by Hurricane Ivan as it travelled over the continental shelf edge and slope in the Gulf of Mexico. Velocity data were collected as part of the Naval Research Laboratory's Shelf Energetics and Exchange Dynamics (SEED) experiment. Moorings consisted of Trawl Resistant Bottom Mounts (TRBMs) in the form of a dome-shaped pod known as a Barny due to its barnacle-like shape. The Barnies housed ADCPs and wave/tide gauges, and during the hurricane were subject to extreme current conditions. In particular, over the shelf where water depths are 60 - 90m and surface waves reached significant wave heights of at least 20 m, bottom currents generated by these waves were over 2 m s(-1). Despite these extreme conditions, which set the nearby National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 42040 adrift, the Barnies proved themselves to be robust, and continued to measure water velocity and pressure both during and after the hurricane's presence in the region. This was the first test of the instrumentation setup under these extreme conditions, and their survival allowed a unique suite of measurements to be made which would not have otherwise been possible. Two distinct responses were observed over the shallow shelf edge (similar to 90 m) and the deep slope (similar to 500 - 1000 m). During the forcing stage of the hurricane over the shelf edge, internal wave motions were found to be three-dimensional, and after the passage of the hurricane velocity fluctuations became primarily horizontal and lasted about 3 days. Over the slope, inertial (f) and super-inertial waves with frequencies of 2f, 3f, 4f and higher were excited by the hurricane. These super-inertial waves persisted for 2-4 days while near-inertial waves lasted more than a week. The super-inertial fluctuations were found near bottom over the slope (500 - 1000 m) where kinetic energy levels were at least 25 times larger than the kinetic energy level during calm weather, indicating that turbulent dissipation rates and eddy diffusivities increased by two orders of magnitude. The storm-generated super-inertial motions have the potential to enhance mixing in the deeper part of the thermocline. The storm-generated super-inertial motions lead to mixing both along and across isopycnals, acting as a potential vector for warmer waters to reach the deep ocean.

AB  - Adipose tissue function changes with development. In the newborn, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is essential for ensuring effective adaptation to the extrauterine environment, and its growth during gestation is largely dependent on glucose supply from the mother to the fetus. The amount, location and type of adipose tissue deposited can also determine fetal glucose homeostasis. Adipose tissue first appears at around mid-gestation. Total adipose mass then increases through late gestation, when it comprises a mixture of white and brown adipocytes. BAT possesses a unique uncoupling protein, UCP1, which is responsible for the rapid generation of large amounts of heat at birth. Then, during postnatal life some, but not all, depots are replaced by white fat. This process can be utilised to investigate the physiological conversion of brown to white fat, and how it is re-programmed by nutritional changes in pre- and postnatal environments. A reduction in early BAT deposition may perpetuate through the life cycle, thereby suppressing energy expenditure and ultimately promoting obesity. Normal fat development profiles in the offspring are modified by changes in maternal diet at defined stages of pregnancy, ultimately leading to adverse long-term outcomes. For example, excess macrophage accumulation and the onset of insulin resistance occur in an adipose tissue depot-specific manner in offspring born to mothers fed a suboptimal diet from early to mid-gestation. In conclusion, the growth of the different fetal adipose tissue depots varies according to maternal diet and, if challenged in later life, this can contribute to insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis.

VL  - 23

SP  - 837-849
AB  - Spatial autocorrelation is a correlation between the values of a single variable, considering their geographical locations. This concept has successfully been used for multi-site generation of daily precipitation data (Khalili et al. in J Hydrometeorol 8(3):396-412, 2007). This paper presents an extension of this approach. It aims firstly to obtain an accurate reproduction of the spatial intermittence property in synthetic precipitation amounts, and then to extend the multi-site approach to the generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data. Monthly spatial exponential functions have been developed for each weather station according to the spatial dependence of the occurrence processes over the watershed, in order to fulfill the spatial intermittence condition in the synthetic time series of precipitation amounts. As was the case for the precipitation processes, the multi-site generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data is realized using spatially autocorrelated random numbers. These random numbers are incorporated into the weakly stationary generating process, as with the Richardson weather generator, and with no modifications made. Suitable spatial autocorrelations of random numbers allow the reproduction of the observed daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations. The Peribonca River Basin watershed is used to test the performance of the proposed approaches. Results indicate that the spatial exponential functions succeeded in reproducing an accurate spatial intermittence in the synthetic precipitation amounts. The multi-site generation approach was successfully applied for the weather data, which were adequately generated, while maintaining efficient daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations.

TI  - Establishment of Harmonia axyridis on citrus and some data on its phenology in Greece
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 183-191
AB  - In September 1993, a colony of Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae) was imported from France into Greece. In 1994, insectary-reared adults were released in II citrus orchards in four citrus-growing areas of Greece. Between May 19 and June 8, 1994, H. axyridis was recovered from a total of seven localities in three of these areas. This species was established on orange, mandarin and sour orange trees heavily infested with Toxoptera aurantii, Aphis spiraecola and A. gossypii; its absence from the remaining four localities may have been the result of low prey densities. Twenty-three days after the initial releases, H. axyridis larvae comprised 57.9% and 83.3%, respectively, of the aphidophagous coccinellid larval populations in two localities (on Chios Island). In samples taken at Leonidion 43 days after the introduction release, both adult and larval populations of H. axyridis represented approximately one-third of aphidophagous coccinellid adults and larvae found, whereas the indigenous Adalia bipunctata comprised about one-half of the population. In cages placed outside the Athens laboratory, H. axyridis completed four overlapping generations annually; average longevities of 56.2, 66.8, 78.9 and 102.2 days, respectively, were recorded for the successive generations. Adults of the 3rd and 4th generations overwintered, giving rise to the following year's Ist generation. Oviposition began in April and emergence of Ist generation adults occurred in mid-May. The egg-laying activity of the females throughout the warm period of the year indicates that H. axyridis does not diapause in summer. From December until March, small aggregations (2-4 individuals) were observed within the cages at protected sites.

AB  - Most animals advertise their unprofitability to potential predators via conspicuous signals. Whether the strength of this aposematic signal indicates the quality and quantity of chemical defenses in animals is controversial. Here, we investigated the relationship between the conspicuousness of an aposematic signal and toxicity, which likely depends, at least in part, on dietary sources, in the newt Cynops pyrrhogaster. Our results indicate that the magnitude of the aposematic signal was not correlated with the amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 6-epi TTX of wild individuals among populations. Using atoxic newts, reared from eggs, we compared the ability to accumulate TTX from diets between mainland and island populations. Newts of a mainland population that exhibited a less conspicuous signal accumulated more TTX than did equivalent newts of an insular population that displayed a more conspicuous signal; this was unrelated to variation in the toxicity of wild individuals of these two populations. We also found toxicity of wild newts changed over approximately one generation (10 years) in both populations. These results indirectly suggest that environmental variance, such as fluctuations in TTX resources in nature, may obscure differences in the ability of wild newts to accumulate TTX, and that this variation may be responsible for a lack of correlation between the strength of a newt's signal and its toxicity in the wild. These results imply that toxicity of wild individuals likely is a phenotypic trait largely dependent on environmental conditions.

VL  - 419
IS  - 1
SP  - 207-223
AB  - The difficulties of the phenomenological analysis of the weak s-component and the need for a comparison with the astrophysical picture are discussed. New results of s-process calculations in massive stars during both core He and shell C burning are presented. They are obtained after adopting an updated nuclear network, which includes the deviation from the 1/v trends of neutron capture cross sections, as well as an extrapolation of beta decay rates to the high temperatures characterizing carbon burning. For a complete discussion of the branching at Kr-85, we additionally present a new measurement of the ''Rb neutron capture cross section. The reproduction of the weak component by successive stellar generations is investigated through a global check which takes into account the interference of the main component in the atomic mass range from Fe to Sr. Consequently, the results of s-processing in low-mass stars during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase are also considered, starting from the same set of revised nuclear parameters. A satisfactory match of the solar s-abundances is reached, where the problem of the Kr-86 overproduction by the main component is overcome by varying the [sigma(n, gamma)] of Kr-84, Kr-85, Kr-86 inside their present uncertainties, and by considering an additional contribution to [sigma(n,gamma)](Kr-86] at low temperature by direct captures or undetected resonances. A detailed analysis of the neutron flow at branchings and at bottleneck points is performed, stressing the analogies and differences between the phenomenological and astrophysical picture.

SP  - 122-128
AB  - Studies were conducted to investigate the non-specific immune responses and disease-resistance of juvenile turbot Scophthalmus maximus, cultured at four different salinities (8, 20, 32 and 40). Three concentrations (3.75x10(7), 3.75x10(8) and 3.75x10(9) CFU/ml) of Vibrio anguillarum suspension were employed at each salinity to determine the 4-day LD(50). The serum lysozyme activity, the alternative complement pathway activity (ACH50) and the phagocytosis percentage of head kidney in turbot were tested at 24, 48 and 72 h post-challenge of V. anguillarum (1.1x10(8) CFU/ml, 0.1 ml), respectively, to evaluate the non-specific immune responses at the selected rearing salinities. Fish reared at salinity 20 had the lowest mortality, namely, the highest 4-day LD(50) value (8.88 +/- 0.17). Besides, the lysozyme activity, ACH50 and the phagocytosis of turbot were the highest at the salinity 20, but with the lowest at the salinity 40 treatment regardless of sampling time. In addition, the non-specific immune activities kept increasing within 72 h post-challenge of V. anguillarum, except that the lysozyme activity increased from 24 to 48 h, and then decreased from 48 to 72 h at 40 significantly. These results together indicate that rearing in intermediate salinity (20) was able to enhance the immunity and disease-resistance of turbot.

TI  - Growth and neutralization of sulfate aerosols in human airways
VL  - 81
IS  - 1
SP  - 480-490
AB  - Evidence derived from in vivo and in vitro laboratory experiments, controlled human exposure studies, and epidemiological studies on mortality and morbidity point to a positive correlation between acid aerosol inhalation and lung impairment. The lung has two important lines of defense against acid aerosols: ii neutralization by oral or nasal airway ammonia and 2) buffering by mucus lining of the airway. A mathematical model is developed to study the growth and endogenous ammonia neutralization of sulfate-containing aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract. It is shown that an accurate prediction of the luminal ammonia concentration and relative humidity in each generation is essential for quantifying the degree of neutralization of the acidic particles. The model predicts substantial growth and neutralization for small particles 1<0.1 mu m), whereas larger particles (>1.0 mu m) experience negligible neutralization. The predicted neutralization of intermediate-sized particles depends on the parameter values used in the model. Water supersaturations that occur in the respiratory tract when ambient conditions are cool and humid cause rapid particle growth and consequently enhance neutralization. Thus the neutralization depends on the particle size as well as on ambient conditions. but experimental investigations have reported a wide range of neutralizations (6, 17, 27). Many authors have developed theoretical models to predict heat and water vapor transport in the lumen (11). Models have also been developed for the growth of hygroscopic particles in the human airways (2, 7). Cocks and McElroy (3) studied the growth and neutralization of sulfuric acid aerosols at 1,000 and 100 mu g/m(3) under constant ammonia concentrations of 500 and 50 ppb and a relative humidity of 99.5%-conditions similar to those inhuman airways A Lagrangian approach has been used to simulate the simultaneous growth and neutralization of an acid aerosol as a function of its position in the respiratory airways. Heat, water, and ammonia transport were considered between the submucosal tissue, mucus, lumen, and suspended particles. In MODELING, we describe the governing equations and the simplifying assumptions. We report the numerical method used, modeling results, and sensitivity analysis in METHODS AND MODEL PREDICTIONS and finally present our discussion and conclusions.

TI  - A Single-Nucleotide Insertion in a Drug Transporter Gene Induces a Thermotolerance Phenotype in Gluconobacter frateurii by Increasing the NADPH/NADP(+) Ratio via Metabolic Change
VL  - 84
IS  - 10
AB  - Thermotolerant microorganisms are beneficial to the fermentation industry because they reduce the need for cooling and offer other operational advantages. Previously, we obtained a thermally adapted Gluconobacter frateurii strain by experimental evolution. In the present study, we found only a single G insertion in the adapted strain, which causes a frameshift in a gene encoding a putative drug transporter. A mutant derivative strain with the single G insertion in the transporter gene (Wild-G) was constructed from the wild-type strain and showed increased thermotolerance. We found that the thermotolerant strains accumulated substantial intracellular trehalose and manifested a defect in sorbose assimilation, suggesting that the transporter is partly involved in trehalose efflux and sorbose uptake and that the defect in the transporter can improve thermotolerance. The.otsAB strain, constructed by elimination of the trehalose synthesis gene in the wild type, showed no trehalose production but, unexpectedly, much better growth than the adapted strain at high temperatures. The.otsAB mutant produced more acetate as the final metabolite than the wild-type strain did. We hypothesized that trehalose does not contribute to thermotolerance directly; rather, a metabolic change including increased carbon flux to the pentose phosphate pathway may be the key factor. The NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was higher in strain Wild-G, and much higher in the Delta otsAB strain, than in the wild-type strain. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were lower in the thermotolerant strains. We propose that the defect of the transporter causes the metabolic flux to generate more NADPH, which may enhance thermotolerance in G. frateurii.

TI  - Stability and exchange of guest molecules in gas hydrates under the influence of CH4, CO2, N-2 and CO2+N-2 gases at low-pressures
VL  - 78
AB  - Gas recovery from the natural gas hydrate (NGH) deposits is a current topic of interest. Apart from the conventional thermal stimulation, depressurisation and chemical injection methods, the guest molecular replacement method in hydrates offers dual advantage such as retention of their structural stability, and as a sink for carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the molecular exchangeability shows significant variance and the mechanism is also incomprehensible. This study is aimed at probing the stability of gas (CH4 & CO2) hydrates in the presence of CO2/CH4, N-2 and their mixtures at low-pressure (similar to 1.0 MPa) conditions. The selected experimental conditions help gain insight into the guest-guest exchange. Evaluation of gas pressure during the dissociation process indicates the presence of mixed hydrates. The micro-Raman investigations elucidate the occurrence of mixed hydrate seed crystals, encasing both CH4/CO2 molecules of initial hydrates, and also the molecules from the injected gas. The characteristic signatures of CH4 & CO2 molecules in hydrate systems broadly agree with the literature data, while that of N-2 pointedly closer to the gas phase signature, indicating its role as a help-gas to promote replacement/rearrangement of guests in hydrate lattice.

VL  - 27

SP  - 241-256
AB  - The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a heat-sensitive plant species in which excessive abscission of reproductive organs occur during hot weather. This results in 'split sets' 2 and yield reductions, and, in extreme heat stress, plant produce few or no pods. We evaluated 74 bean genotypes in terms of leaf heat-tolerance (HT) and leaf heat-acclimation potential (HAP), as expressed by heat killing-time (HKT), the time in minutes needed to cause 50% ion leakage from leaf tissue heat stressed at 50-degrees-C. Leaf HT is defined as the leaf HKT of plants without prior conditioning at 37-degrees-C day/night temperature and leaf HAP as the change in leaf HT following exposure of the plant at 37-degrees-C day/night for 24 h. Among 74 bean genotypes examined, leaf HT ranged from 5 to 30 min HKT, whereas leaf HAP ranged from 35 to 130 min HKT. Positive significant correlations were observed between leaf HAP and post-stress performance in plant dry-weight, pod set, pod weight and yield among bean genotypes. However, correlations were not significant between leaf HT and post-stress performance. A relationship between heat resistance - consisting of the combination Of HT and HAP - and heat injury is proposed. Interpretation of the differential amounts of heat injury among genotypes having different HAP, is discussed. We view leaf HT and leaf HAP as two distinguishable phenomena. We suggest that, in breeding programs. HAP may be the more important of the two, and should be evaluated as a selection criterion for improving crop performance in high-temperature environments.

AB  - We compared the habitat selection (temperature and dissolved oxygen) of striped bass (STB) Morone saxatilis and hybrid striped bass (HSB; palmetto bass [male white bass M chrysops x female striped bass]) in Claytor Lake, Virginia. Striped bass (n = 28) and HSB (n = 33) were implanted with temperature-sensitive radio tags and tracked biweekly for a period of 19 months to record position and habitat use. Striped bass averaged 715 mm total length (range 533-940) whereas HSB averaged 547 mm total length (range 460-659). Habitat separation was most apparent in the warm season months of June through August. During this period, when deoxygenation of the metalimnion and hypolimnion was not limiting, STB and HSB segregated according to apparent temperature preferences, with HSB selecting warmer temperatures. As deoxygenation progressed, HSB and especially STB were forced into warmer strata than preferred. Results from this study suggest that if favorable dissolved oxygen levels are maintained, STB and HSB will vertically segregate during summer stratification. Temperature selection and qualitative observations of fish mortality in summer indicated that adult HSB would be less vulnerable than adult STB to a temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in summer and its detrimental effects.

VL  - 41

AB  - Climate change affects the sustainability of farming systems by downgrading soil fertility and diminishing crop yields. Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals aims to achieve key performance indicators to convert effectually currently degraded agroecosystems into smart, climate-resilient, and profitable farming systems. The introduction of alternative crops could equilibrate the negative impact of increased temperatures and water scarcity to ensure sufficient farm profitability. Alternative crops such as quinoa, teff, tritordeum, camelina, nigella, chia, and sweet potato show a high acclimatization potential to various conditions and could be components of novel re-designed agroecosystems, satisfying the goals the EU Green Deal for reduced chemical input use by 2030. In certain occasions, they adapt even better than conventional or traditional crops and could be integrated in crop rotations, demonstrating multiple uses that would benefit farmers. This review aimed to (i) evaluate seven alternative crops based on their potential contribution to climate change mitigation, in compliance with the EU (European Union) Green Deal objectives and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the UN (United Nations), and (ii) examine the factors that would determine their successful integration in the Mediterranean Basin. These limiting factors for crop establishment included (i) soil properties (soil texture, pH value, salinity, and sodicity), (ii) environmental parameters (temperature, altitude, latitude, photoperiod), and (iii) crop performance and dynamics regarding water demands, fertilization needs, light, and heat requirements. All proposed crops were found to be adaptable to the Mediterranean climate characteristics and promising for the implementation of the goals of EU and UN.

TI  - Influence of timing of broodstock collection on conditioning, oocyte production, and larval rearing of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), at six production sites in France
VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SP  - 465-474
AB  - Gametogenic development and response to conditioning procedures of six samples of oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) collected in the Bassin d'Arcachon, each cultivated at a different production site along the Atlantic coast of France were compared simultaneously from December 1998 to July 1999. Oysters were conditioned with and without food (fed oysters and unfed oysters, respectively). Samples at northern production sites (Baie des Veys, Aber Benoit, and Baden) initiated gonadal development and spawning about one month earlier than those at southern production sites (Bouin, La Tremblade, and Arcachon). Three conditioning experiments (December 1998 to February 1999, February to April 1999, and April to June 1999) favored Baie des Veys and Aber Benoit oysters, because these resulted in higher body component indices and higher proportions of mature oocytes in the three conditionings that produced more gametes than the other samples in all experiments. Unfed oysters from Baie des Veys and Aber Benoit produced viable gametes and larvae in all the experiments. No significant difference was observed in larval culture (growth and mortality) among samples, of both fed and unfed animals. Differences in the timing of gametogenesis and response to conditioning among northern and southern samples seem adaptive and non-genetic in nature, since all oysters were collected from the same population in the bay at Arcachon. Nutrient recycling seems to have been an important regulating factor for gametogenesis in the northern samples. The occurrence of oysters in different locales having differences in the timing of gametogenesis and response to conditioning has implications for spat production in hatcheries.

TI  - To bias correct or not to bias correct? An agricultural impact modelers' perspective on regional climate model data
VL  - 304
AB  - Many open questions and unresolved issues surround the topic of bias correction (BC) in climate change impact studies (CCIS). One question relates to the contribution of downscaling of climate change scenarios on the uncertainties in results obtained using impact models for agriculture. In particular, for large area or regional agricultural impact assessments, the question of bias correction is of high relevance. Relatively few studies exist looking at the quantification of the impacts of BC methods in general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) data on results of such impact studies. Here, we quantify the impact of different BC methods on temperature (T) and precipitation (P) from different CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations, and how the debiased T&P signal may propagate through agricultural impact models. Specifically, we estimate the impact of BC on (i) an empirical P- and fuzzy rule-based algorithm to estimate the crop planting date, and (ii) a mechanistic T&P-based approach to quantify the crop suitability index (CSI) for the main staple crops in West Africa (i.e. groundnut, maize, pearl millet, sorghum). Both approaches serve as a proxy for more complex process-based ecophysiological crop models. Depending on the choice of the BC method, the uncertainties in the assessment of the CSI can be more than twice as high compared to the uncertainties from the GCM-RCM model selection. Comparing the estimated CSI values with observed harvest area, it is found that BC generally improves the performance for models with low hit rates (< 30-35%), but decreases the performance for models with relatively high hit rates (> 35%). Such consequences can also be expected for process-based crop models, which are developed to operate on field-scale but are driven by coarser scale RCMs. It is concluded that such agriculturally oriented climate impact models as investigated here should be interpreted with great caution if applied without BC or relying on a single BC approach only. Rather, we suggest to include different BC approaches in the generation of climate projections for CCIS and quantify their uncertainties following a super-ensemble probabilistic assessment.

VL  - 130
IS  - 14
SP  - 4660-4668
AB  - Biomineral matrix formation and molecular recognition are two important processes associated with eggshell biomineralization. To understand these two processes, a major intracrystailine peptide pelovaterin, was isolated from turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) eggshell and its tertiary and quaternary structures were established. The global fold of pelovaterin is similar to that of human beta-defensins but has a large hydrophobic core and a short hydrophilic N-terminal segment, which is not preserved in defensins. Pelovaterin exhibits strong antimicrobial activity against two pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, and stabilizes a thin film of metastable vaterite. We show that pelovaterin self-aggregates in the form of micellar nanospheres and the aggregation in solution is entropy-driven. It is suggested that the micellar aggregation of pelovaterin is responsible for the induction and stabilization of the metastable phase by altering the interfacial energy. The results demonstrate the adaptability of an extracellular matrix protein to perform multiple tasks: polymorph discrimination and protection of the contents of the egg against bacteria invasion.

VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SP  - 252-270
AB  - Salmon life histories are finely tuned to local environmental conditions, which are intimately linked to climate. We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i. e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.

AB  - Tolerance of climatic stressors is an important predictor of the current distribution of insect species, their potential to invade new environments, and their responses to rapid climate change. Cold stress causes acute injury to nerves and muscles, and here we tested the hypothesis that low temperature causes sublethal deficits in locomotor behaviors that are dependent on neuromuscular function. To do so, we applied a previously developed assay, the rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING) assay, to investigate behavioral consequences of cold stress in Drosophila melanogaster. The RING assay allows for rapid assessment of negative geotaxis behavior by quantifying climbing height and willingness to climb after cold stress. We exposed flies to cold stress at 0 degrees C and assessed the extent to which duration of cold stress, recovery time, and cold acclimation influenced climbing performance. There was a clear dose-response relationship between cold exposure and performance deficits, with climbing height and willingness decreasing as cold exposure increased from 2 to 24hr. Following cold exposure of an intermediate duration (12hr), climbing height and willingness gradually improved as recovery time increased from 4 to 72hr but flies never fully recovered. Finally, cold acclimation improved overall climbing height and willingness in both untreated and cold-stressed flies but did not prevent a reduction in climbing performance. Thus, cold stress causes deficits in locomotor and behavior that are dependent on the dose of cold exposure and persist long after the stress subsides. These results likely have implications for the ecological and evolutionary responses of insect populations to thermally variable environments.

TI  - Real episodic growth of continental crust or artifact of preservation? A 3-D geodynamic model
VL  - 118
IS  - 5
SP  - 2356-2370
AB  - We investigate whether the observed zircon age distribution of continental crust (CC) is produced by real crustal growth episodes or is only an artifact of preservation. In connection with the second alternative of this question, other authors proposed that there was little episodicity in the production of new CC and that modeling corroborates this opinion. We conclude that a combination of the two answers might be possible. In matters of modeling, however, we ascertain that a dynamic modeling of the convection-differentiation system of the mantle reveals the high probability of magmatic episodes. We solve the full set of balance equations in a 3-D spherical-shell mantle. The heat-producing elements are redistributed by chemical differentiation. A realistic solidus model of mantle peridotite is essential for an applicable model. The solidus depends not only on depth but also on the volatile concentration. Furthermore, we introduced realistic profiles of Gruneisen parameter, viscosity, adiabatic temperature, thermal expansivity, and specific heat. Our model automatically produces lithospheric plates and growing continents. Regarding number, size, form, distribution, and surface velocity of the continents, no constraints have been prescribed. Regions of the input parameter space (Ra, sigma(y), k, f(3)) that are favorable with respect to geophysical quantities show simultaneously not only episodicity of CC growth but also a reproduction of the observed zircon-age maxima referring to the instants of time. We also obtain Archean events for ages greater than 3000 Ma that are not or scarcely visible in the observed zircon ages. Sinusoidal parts of the evolution curve of qob, Ur, and E-kin are superposed with a monotonous decrease. The volumetrically averaged mantle temperature, T-mean, however, decreases smoothly and slowly, nearly without pronounced variations. Therefore, we can dismiss catastrophic mechanisms that simultaneously incorporate the whole mantle.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 203-224
AB  - 1. Kielder Reservoir regulates the Rivers North Tyne and Tyne. It provides a regular supply of water for downstream users, supports abstractions for a major water transfer scheme and provides hydroelectric power (HEP). Kielder's release regime typically alternates between a 1.3 m(3) s(-1) compensation flow and 10(-15) m(3) s(-1) HEP releases of between 3 and 7 days in duration. Occasionally releases of up to 30 m(3) s(-1) are made for the purpose of encouraging fish runs, for recreational events or to help in water quality management. The impacts of this release regime on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) habitat at four sites on the North Tyne are assessed and alternative regimes, designed to minimize impacts, are presented. 2. There is no evidence that the compensation flow results in extreme loss of instream habitat. A discharge of 1.3 m(3) s(-1) ensures that water is maintained over most of the channel area at sites representative of upper, middle and lower sections of the North Tyne. This discharge lies above breaks in slope of respective site discharge versus wetted area curves; thus, disproportionate increases in discharge would be needed to increase wetted area. Simulations using the Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM) suggest that the compensation now provides between 50% and 90% of the maximum possible weighted usable area (WUA) for juvenile (0 +) salmonids. 3. During HEP releases, juvenile salmonid habitat (WUA) apparently falls to between 20 and 40% of site maxima. Newly emerged juvenile fish (March and April) are most affected by HEP releases because they are relatively small (25 mm in length) and water temperatures are relatively low at this time of year. During March and April, critical near-bed displacement velocities for newly emerged fish may be exceeded across large parts (80%) of sites up to 8 km downstream from Kielder Reservoir; fish would either be displaced downstream or forced to relocate to flow refuge areas. 4. The availability of Atlantic salmon spawning habitat (WUA) at a key site is limited by the compensation flow; 1.3 m(3) s(-1) provides approximately one third of the habitat available at the optimum discharge (4 m(3) s(-1)). At this site, a discharge of approximately 2 m(3) s(-1) is needed to ensure most of the bed is inundated by water. Regulation has reduced the duration of flows exceeding 2 m(3) s(-1) from 90 to 60% of the spawning season. 5. Simulations suggest that when discharge drops from 30 m(3) s(-1) to the compensation flow, up to 60% of the optimum spawning habitat available at the former discharge may be left stranded (dry). This could potentially lead to egg or alevin mortality. 6. PHABSIM simulations suggest that increasing the compensation flow to 4 m(3) s(-1) during the spawning period (November and December) is likely to increase the availability of suitable spawning habitat. Also, increasing the compensation flow to 2 m(3) s(-1) during the incubation period (January through March) would minimize redd stranding. Reductions in the number of HEP releases in March and April would limit the extent to which newly emerged fish are exposed to velocities that potentially displace them. Such changes to the Kielder release regime may have implications for water resource management. While it is important that the biological instream flow requirements of the North Tyne are incorporated into the Kielder operating policy, these should be integrated along with the need for channel maintenance flows, downstream water supply abstractions and HEP generation, as well as for transfers of water to other catchments.

AB  - Screening tomato genotypes in terms of compounds that affect fruit quality in post-harvest period is an important task for breeders. It is important for selection of genotypes that are characterized by desirable traits, such as prolonged shelf life, the possibility of prolonged storing and fruit firmness and theirs including in breeding programs. Content of beta-carotene, total acid and dry matter have been investigated in tomato fruits in post harvest period for ten tomato genotypes. The fruits have been picked 65 days after anthesis and kept for 60 days. During this time, the samples have been evaluated six times. On the basis of one-way and two-way ANOVA, group comparisons have been performed, by complex contrast comparisons. Regression analysis has been performed for each genotype and calculation of homogeneity of slope coefficients. According to the regression ANOVA concerning beta-carotene content, the results are not significant for any genotype. There was significant total acid content decrease over time for two genotypes (Korona x L-10 F1 i Korona x L-12 F2). In rin genotypes, significant dry matter content decrease over time was found for parents and offspring generations (L -10 9.457, Korona x L-10 F1 31.946 and Korona x L-10 F2 20.074).

VL  - 23
SP  - 584-587
AB  - The high ground temperature is a prominent problem in the construction of deep buried long tunnels. Based on the analysis of high ground temperature in existing tunnels, the influence of high ground temperature on tunnel construction was divided into three situations, namely the harm to human body, effects on labor productivity and accident rate increasing. Then the high temperature heat sources during the tunnel construction were researched. The high ground temperature evolution law of famous tunnel in the history was studied by using comparative analysis method, also the reason of ground temperature anomalies and the heat transfer type of rock mass was obtained. Based on the geothermal gradient formula and the reliability theory, the risk probability model of high ground temperature was obtained in the deep buried long tunnel construction. The results show that the method can predict the high ground temperature in deep buried tunnel accurately.

TI  - Forest Fire Detection of FY-3D Using Genetic Algorithm and Brightness Temperature Change
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
AB  - As one of China's new generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, FengYun-3D (FY-3D) provides critical data for forest fire detection. Most of the existing related methods identify fire points by comparing the spatial features and setting thresholds empirically. However, they ignore temporal features that are associated with forest fires. Besides, they are difficult to generalize to multiple areas with different environmental characteristics. A novel method based on FY-3D combining the genetic algorithm and brightness temperature change detection is proposed in this work to improve these problems. After analyzing the spatial features of the FY-3D data, it adaptively detects potential fire points based on these features using the genetic algorithm, then filters the points with contextual information. To address the false alarms resulting from the confusing spectral characteristics between fire pixels and conventional hotspots, temporal information is introduced and the "MIR change rate" based on the multitemporal brightness temperature change is further proposed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several fire events occurring in different areas are used for testing. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MYD14) is chosen as the validation data to assess the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. A comparison of results demonstrates that the algorithm can identify fire points effectively and obtain a higher accuracy than the previous FY-3D algorithm.

TI  - The effects of future nationwide forest transition to discharge in the 21st century with regard to general circulation model climate change scenarios
VL  - 149
SP  - 288-296
AB  - Forest disturbance (or land-cover change) and climatic variability are commonly recognised as two major drivers interactively influencing hydrology in forested watersheds. Future climate changes and corresponding changes in forest type and distribution are expected to generate changes in rainfall runoff that pose a threat to river catchments. It is therefore important to understand how future climate changes will effect average rainfall distribution and temperature and what effect this will have upon forest types across Japan. Recent deforestation of the present-day coniferous forest and expected increases in evergreen forest are shown to influence runoff processes and, therefore, to influence future runoff conditions. We strongly recommend that variations in forest type be considered in future plans to ameliorate projected climate changes. This will help to improve water retention and storage capacities, enhance the flood protection function of forests, and improve human health. We qualitatively assessed future changes in runoff including the effects of variation in forest type across Japan. Four general circulation models (GCMs) were selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble to provide the driving fields: the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model (HadGEM), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) climate model. The simulations consisted of an ensemble including multiple physics configurations and different reference concentration pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5), the results of which have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on forest type in Japan are based on the balance amongst changes in rainfall distribution, temperature and hydrological factors. Methods for assessing the impact of such changes include the Catchment Simulator modelling frameworks based on the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) model, which was expanded to estimate discharge by incorporating the effects of forest-type transition across the whole of Japan. The results indicated that, by the 2090s, annual runoff will increase above present-day values. Increases in annual variation in runoff by the 2090s was predicted to be around 14.1% when using the MRI-GCM data and 44.4% when using the HadGEM data. Analysis by long-term projection showed the largest increases in runoff in the 2090s were related to the type of forest, such as evergreen. Increased runoff can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including increased flooding events, worsened water quality, habitat destruction and changes to the forest moisture-retaining function. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on water generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The transient analyses of the thermoelastic contact problem are performed for carbon-carbon composite multidisk brakes subject to mechanical and frictionally excited thermal loads. The finite element method, based on the coupled theory in which displacement and temperature fields are mutually affected, is applied for the numerical simulations. In the present study, to improve the accuracy of computations and stabilize the algorithm, the implicit transient scheme is used for the thermoelastic analysis. The law of action and reaction, Signorini's law of contact, Coulomb's law of friction, and Archard's law of wear are applied to be valid locally at each point for friction surfaces. The computation results are obtained for the antiskid brake conditions and presented for the transient evolution of contact pressure, temperature on each friction surface between the bodies, and thermoelastic deformations. It is also found that the high thermal stresses due to considerable temperature difference during the landing process occur in multidisk brakes.

TI  - Adaptation of maize production to climate change in North China Plain: Quantify the relative contributions of adaptation options
VL  - 33
IS  - 2
SP  - 103-116
AB  - Adaptation is a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. We need to evaluate the relative potential of adaptation strategies, and to develop effective adaptation strategies to cope with climate risk. Here, we apply a super-ensemble-based probabilistic projection system (SuperEPPS) to project maize productivity and evapotranspiration (ET) over growing period during 2050s in the North China Plain, and to examine the relative contributions of adaptation options. Based on a large number of simulation outputs from the super-ensemble-based projection, our results show that without adaptation maize yield could decrease averagely by 13.2-19.1%, and ET during growing period could decrease by 15.6-21.8% during 2050s, relative to 1961-1990. In comparison with the experiment without adaptation, using high-temperature sensitive varieties, maize yield could averagely increase by 1.0-6.0%, 9.9-15.2%, and 4.1-5.6%, by adopting adaptation options of early planting, fixing variety growing duration, and late planting, respectively. ET could averagely increase by 1.9-4.4%, 1.9-3.7%, and -2.9% to -0.7%. respectively. In contrast, using high-temperature tolerant varieties, maize yield could averagely increase by -2.4% to -1.4%, 34.7-45.6%. and 5.7-6.1%, respectively. ET could averagely increase by 0.7-0.9%, 9.4-11.6%, and -0.4% to 0.2%, respectively. The spatial patterns show that the relative contributions of adaptation options can be geographically quite different, depending on the climate and variety properties. The biggest benefits will result from the development of new crop varieties that are high-temperature tolerant and have high thermal requirements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 34
IS  - 2
SP  - 268-285
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are compounds with a minimum of two six-atom aromatic fused rings. PACs arise from incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of organic matter and are ubiquitous in the environment. Within PACs, carcinogenicity is generally regarded to be the most important public health concern. However, toxicity in other systems (reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity) has also been reported. Despite the large number of PACs identified in the environment, research attention to understand exposure and health effects of PACs has focused on a relatively limited subset, namely polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the PACs with only carbon and hydrogen atoms. To triage the rest of the vast number of PACs for more resource-intensive testing, we developed a data-driven approach to contextualize hazard characterization of PACs, by leveraging the available data from various data streams (in silico toxicity, in vitro activity, structural fingerprints, and in vivo data availability). The PACs were clustered on the basis of their in silico toxicity profiles containing predictions from 8 different categories (carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and urinary toxicity). We found that PACs with the same parent structure (e.g., fluorene) could have diverse in silico toxicity profiles. In contrast, PACs with similar substituted groups (e.g., alkylated-PAHs) or heterocyclics (e.g., N-PACs) with varying ring sizes could have similar in silico toxicity profiles, suggesting that these groups are better candidates for toxicity read-across analysis. The dusters/regions associated with certain in silico toxicity, in vitro activity, and structural fingerprints were identified. We found that genotoxicity/carcinogenicity (in silico toxicity) and xenobiotic homeostasis and stress response (in vitro activity), respectively, dominate the toxicity/activity variation seen in the PACs. The "hot spots" with enriched toxicity/activity in conjunction with availability of in vivo carcinogenicity data revealed regions of either data-poor (hydroxylated-PAHs) or data-rich (unsubstituted, parent PAHs) PACs. These regions offer potential targets for prioritization of further in vivo assessment and for chemical read-across efforts. The analysis results are searchable through an interactive web application (https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/pacs_tabIeau), allowing for alternative hypothesis generation.

TI  - Strategic nest site selection in one of the world's largest loggerhead turtle nesting colonies, on Maio Island, Cabo Verde
AB  - For species without parental care, such as sea turtles, nest site selection is particularly important for embryo development, hatchling survival and, ultimately, reproductive success. We conducted an 8-year (2012-2019) capture-mark-recapture study of the re-nesting behaviour of loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta to identify both inter- and intra-beach patterns of nest site selection. Our study site, Maio Island in the archipelago of Cabo Verde, hosts one of the largest loggerhead turtle nesting colonies globally. Of 1,060 females analysed, 77% laid repeated clutches within 15 km of their previous nesting sites both between and within nesting seasons. This site fidelity was particularly high (64-71%) for turtles nesting on the east coast of Maio Island. In two areas of the island (north-west and south-east) individual nesting zone consistency was extremely low (10-25%). In all cases extra-zone re-nesting events mainly occurred on the east coast. We also found that females avoided re-nesting near the shoreline, which is particularly relevant in the context of rising sea levels. Overall, loggerhead turtles nesting in Maio Island are philopatric but are using a bet-edging strategy to distribute nests amongst several beaches, choosing the safest area within each beach to maximize their reproductive success. This study highlights the priority sites for protection on Maio Island and could help to optimize capture-mark-recapture programmes. The data reveal the potential for adaptive responses to projected sea level rises.

AB  - In order to describe kinetic differences between isothermal and anisothermal fermentations, a study using an automatic device for monitoring fermentation was conducted. Isothermal alcoholic fermentations were compared with anisothermal fermentations reaching the same final temperature. In most cases, the rate at the end of the fermentation was faster under anisothermal conditions. This phenomenon appeared to be influenced by several parameters, particularly the assimilable nitrogen content of the must. However, in some cases, the fermentation rate decreased dramatically after the activation was noticed because of the adverse effect of loss of cell viability. Some practical consequences of these observations are discussed.

VL  - 40

SP  - 910-924
AB  - An objective of the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study was to determine the major sources Of PM2.5 in the Pittsburgh region. Daily 24-hour averaged filter-based data were collected for 13 months, starting in July 2001, including sulfate and nitrate data from IC analysis, trace element data from ICP-MS analysis, and organic and elemental carbon from the thermal optical transmittance (TOT) method and the NIOSH thermal evolution protocol. These data were used in two source-receptor models, Unmix and PMF. Unmix, which is limited to a maximum number of seven factors, resolved six source factors, including crustal material, a regional transport factor, secondary nitrate, an iron, zinc and manganese factor, specialty steel production and processing, and cadmium. PMF, which has no limit to the number of factors, apportioned the PM2.5 mass into ten factors, including crustal material, secondary sulfate, primary OC and EC, secondary nitrate, an iron, zinc and manganese factor, specialty steel production and processing, cadmium, selenium, lead, and a gallium-rich factor. The Unmix and PMF common factors agree reasonably well, both in composition and contributions to PM2.5. To further identify and apportion the sources Of PM2.5, specific OC compounds that are known markers of some sources were added to the PMF analysis. The results were similar to the original solution, except that the primary OC and EC factor split into two factors. One factor was associated with vehicles as identified by the hopanes, PAH's, and other OC compounds. The other factor had strong correlations with the OC and EC ambient data as well as wood smoke markers such as levoglucosan, syringols, and resin acids.

AB  - This review is dedicated to the comparison of the facts obtained and the proposed hypotheses, to the critical analysis of the situation arisen, and to the estimation of key propositions of the concept developed. The main point is that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) participate directly in expression, variability, selection and evolution of different quantitative characters. Genetic and selection data are considered, and hypotheses of random fixation, marker effect and direct participation of MGE patterns in expression and selection of quantitative characters are discussed. The consequences of temperature treatment are considered and hypotheses of masked selection and temperature induction of transpositions are discussed. The marker effects are shown to be non-sufficient to explain the properties of quantitative character radius incompletes system. The MGE patterns are important components of genetical system of determination of a quantitative character. MGEs modify, enhance the expression of neighbouring polygenes. Temperature effects could be explained by the influence of stress temperature treatment through the system of heat shock response on the capacity of MGEs to transcribe and transpose. The system of diversed MGE patterns in drosophila chromosomes could be believed to be universal genomic system of <<soft>> modification of the polygenic control of any limiting quantitative characters.

TI  - Aggression and courtship differences found in Drosophila melanogaster from two different microclimates at Evolution Canyon, Israel
VL  - 9
AB  - Aggression and courtship behavior were examined of wild Drosophila melanogaster flies isolated from two contrasting microclimates found at Evolution Canyon in Mt. Carmel, Israel: an African-like dry tropical Slope (AS) and a European-like humid temperate Slope (ES), separated by 250 meters. Studies were carried out to ask whether behavioral differences existed between the two populations obtained from opposite slopes with divergent microclimates in Israel. First, we measured and compared intraslope aggression between same sex fly pairings collected from the same slope. Both male and female flies displayed similar fighting abilities from both slopes. ES males, however, from the humid biome, showed a tendency to lunge more per aggressive encounter, compared with AS males from the dry biome. Next, we tested interslope aggression by pairing flies from opposite slopes. ES males displayed higher numbers of lunges, and won more fights against their AS opponents. We also observed enhanced courtship performances in ES compared to AS males. The fighting and courtship superiority seen in ES males could reinforce fitness and pre-mating reproductive isolation mechanisms that underlie incipient sympatric speciation. This may support an evolutionary advantage of adaptively divergent fruit fly aggression phenotypes from different environments.

AB  - The organism and somatic cells thermoresistance was studied on larvae of first generation tilapia obtained from females exposed to low temperature (20-22-degrees-C) at the age of 15-30 days. IT was established that gonads of 15-30-day aged females contained primary sex cells and gonia. The exposure to low temperature resulted in a partial (14.8%) death of females and survived ones lost a part of sex cells, The offspring from these females had an increased organism thermoresistance at both considered stages of development (2 and 15-20 days after emergence). The revealed method of targeted modulation of organism thermoresistance is interesting both for the analysis of microevolutionary mechanisms and for the applied pisciculture.

AB  - Altitudinal gradients are among the most powerful 'natural experiments' for testing ecological and evolutionary responses of biota to geophysical influences, such as low temperature. However, there are two categories of environmental changes with altitude: those physically tied to meters above sea level, such as atmospheric pressure, temperature and clear-sky turbidity; and those that are not generally altitude specific, such as moisture, hours of sunshine, wind, season length, geology and even human land use. The confounding of the first category by the latter has introduced confusion in the scientific literature on altitude phenomena.

TI  - Integrating ecophysiology and plankton dynamics into projected maximum fisheries catch potential under climate change in the Northeast Atlantic
VL  - 68
IS  - 6
SP  - 1008-1018
AB  - Previous global analyses projected shifts in species distributions and maximum fisheries catch potential across ocean basins by 2050 under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. However, these studies did not account for the effects of changes in ocean biogeochemistry and phytoplankton community structure that affect fish and invertebrate distribution and productivity. This paper uses a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model that incorporates these factors to project distribution and maximum catch potential of 120 species of exploited demersal fish and invertebrates in the Northeast Atlantic. Using projections from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM2.1) under the SRES A1B, we project an average rate of distribution-centroid shift of 52 km decade(-1) northwards and 5.1 m decade(-1) deeper from 2005 to 2050. Ocean acidification and reduction in oxygen content reduce growth performance, increase the rate of range shift, and lower the estimated catch potentials (10-year average of 2050 relative to 2005) by 20-30% relative to simulations without considering these factors. Consideration of phytoplankton community structure may further reduce projected catch potentials by similar to 10%. These results highlight the sensitivity of marine ecosystems to biogeochemical changes and the need to incorporate likely hypotheses of their biological and ecological effects in assessing climate change impacts.

TI  - The survival of mantle geochemical heterogeneities
VL  - 160
SP  - 27-46
AB  - The survival of mantle geochemical heterogeneities depends on the relative values of the residence times of individual elements in the mantle and of the scale-dependent mixing rate imposed by convection. Major and trace element data on fresh glasses from the PETDB data base were compiled to extract statistics on MORB compositions. It was found that the log-normal distribution provides an adequate description of the data. New means, modes, and standard deviations have been calculated after correction for crystal fractionation to 8% MgO. The residence times of the incompatible lithophile elements in the mantle were calculated as ratios of the mean mantle (Bulk Silicate Earth minus the continental crust) composition to fluxes of elements into the oceanic crust. They vary within a rather narrow range (4-9 Gy) and the larger uncertainties on U, Th, Ba, K, and Rb come from those on the continental crust composition. The mantle is therefore not at geochemical steady-state and the effect of its primordial composition on models of modern mantle geochemistry is still strong. Up to 50% of incompatible lithophile elements may never have been extracted into the oceanic crust, which expands a conclusion reached previously for Ar-40. The residence time of heat in the mantle is indistinguishable from those of the incompatible lithophile elements implying that 50% of the Earth's primordial heat may still be buried at depth. This simple observation relieves the heat/helium paradox, which was used as an argument in favor of a conductive boundary layer at intermediate depth in the mantle. The balance between buoyancy flux and dissipation provides frame-independent estimates of the rates of mixing by mantle convection: Primordial geochemical anomalies with initial length scales comparable to mantle depths of plate lengths may be marginally visible at the scale of mantle melting underneath mid-ocean ridges (approximate to 50 km), but may show strongly in hot spot basalts and even more so in melt inclusions. A theory of residence time distributions of tracers in a convecting mantle with recycling of the oceanic crust is presented. It demonstrates that up to 50% primordial material may be present in the mantle, but scattered throughout as small (< 10 km) domains, strongly sheared and refolded, and interbedded with younger recycled material.

TI  - Using experimentation to understand the 10-year snowshoe hare cycle in the boreal forest of North America
VL  - 87
IS  - 1
SP  - 87-100
AB  - 1. Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists from the time of Charles Elton in the 1920s. The discovery of large population fluctuations in undisturbed ecosystems challenged the idea that pristine nature was in a state of balance. The 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) across the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska is a classic cycle, recognized by fur traders for more than 300years. 2. Since the 1930s, ecologists have investigated the mechanisms that might cause these cycles. Proposed causal mechanisms have varied from sunspots to food supplies, parasites, diseases, predation and social behaviour. Both the birth rate and the death rate change dramatically over the cycle. Social behaviour was eliminated as a possible cause because snowshoe hares are not territorial and do not commit infanticide. 3. Since the 1960s, large-scale manipulative experiments have been used to discover the major limiting factors. Food supply and predation quickly became recognized as potential key factors causing the cycle. Experiments adding food and restricting predator access to field populations have been decisive in pinpointing predation as the key mechanism causing these fluctuations. 4. The immediate cause of death of most snowshoe hares is predation by a variety of predators, including the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis Kerr). The collapse in the reproductive rate is not due to food shortage as was originally thought, but is a result of chronic stress from predator chases. 5. Five major issues remain unresolved. First, what is the nature of the predator-induced memory that results in the prolonged low phase of the cycle? Second, why do hare cycles form a travelling wave, starting in the centre of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan and travelling across western Canada and Alaska? Third, why does the amplitude of the cycle vary greatly from one cycle to the next in the same area? Fourth, do the same mechanisms of population limitation apply to snowshoe hares in eastern North American or in similar ecosystems across Siberia? Finally, what effect will climatic warming have on all the above issues? The answers to these questions remain for future generations of biologists to determine.

VL  - 73
IS  - 7
SP  - 1239-1246
AB  - Sixteen batches of eggs collected immediately after spawning from five atipa (Hoplosternum littorale, (Hancock, 1828), Siluriformes, Callichthyidae) nests have been incubated at temperatures ranging from 22.5 to 32 degrees C. After a growing period of 8 months allowing all the fishes to express totally all secondary sexual characteristics, the sex of 9756 fishes was determined. The sexing criteria based on the color and length of the first ray of the pectoral fins are very reliable, and may lead to an error for only 0.3% of the fishes. For the 16 batches, the male sex ratio (ratio between the number of males and the total number of fishes) varies from 46.4 to 98.5% and is always greater than 50% with one exception. An overall analysis of the results shows no marked correlation (r(2) = 0.312) between the proportions of males and the thermic conditions during incubation of eggs. But within each set of eggs from the same nest, this ratio systematically increases with increasing temperatures. The very low probability (0.0015) of such an event in the 15 batches of eggs from four independent nests suggests both a strong influence of the incubation temperature on the final proportion of males, and an important parental effect on the thermosensitivity of the offspring. The analysis shows clearly that a differential mortality between the sexes cannot account for the shifts towards such high proportions of males in the sex ratios. Thermosensitivity would be expressed early in this species, in the 3 days following spawning. The validity of these experimental results with regard to the natural environment as well as the potential adaptative advantage of such a mechanism for the species are discussed.

TI  - The impact of diel vertical migration on fatty acid patterns and allocation in Daphnia magna
VL  - 8
AB  - In freshwater zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread predator-avoidance behavior that is induced by kairomones released from fish. Thereby zooplankton reduces predation by fish by staying in deep and dark colder strata during daytime and migrating into warmer layers during night, and thus experiences diel alterations in temperature. Constantly lower temperatures have been shown to increase the relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Daphnia sp. Furthermore, a low dietary supply of the omega 3-PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to limit the induction of DVM in Daphnia magna and the performance of D. magna under fluctuating temperatures, as experienced during DVM. In nature DVM of D. magna in response to fish is accompanied by the presence of fish-borne kairomone and diel fluctuations of depth dependent-parameters like temperature, food, and oxygen supply. Here we investigated the effect of factors, which are differing between Daphnia that perform DVM and those which do not. We selected to examine the effect of changing temperature and light conditions and of the presence/absence of fish kairomones on D. magna. For this purpose, we conducted a full factorial experimental design in which we grew D. magna under constantly warm temperatures in a diel light-dark regime or under alternating temperatures in darkness crossed with the presence or absence of fish kairomones. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of mature animals and of their offspring in each treatment. Simulation of the light and temperature regime of migrating animals in presence of the fish kairomone resulted in an increased relative allocation of the omega 3-PUFA EPA, from adult animals to their offspring, manifesting as decreased EPA concentrations in mothers and increased EPA concentrations in their offspring in response to simulated DVM (mothers). Additionally, EPA concentrations in the offspring were affected by the interaction of simulated DVM and the fish cue. The presence of the fish kairomone alone increased the EPA concentration in the offspring, that was not experiencing simulated DVM. These findings lead to the conclusion that the temperature and light regime associated with DVM alone, as well as in combination with the DVM-inducing fish kairomones, alter the allocation of fatty acids to the offspring in a manner, which is beneficial for the offspring under the decreased average temperatures, which migrating animals are exposed to. A low dietary supply of omega 3-PUFAs may constrain D. magna's amplitude of DVM, but our results suggest that the next generation of animals may be capable of regaining the full DVM amplitude due to the effect of the fish kairomone and the experienced temperature fluctuations (and darkness) on tissue fatty acid composition. These findings suggest that fatty acid limitation in DVM performing Daphnia may be more severe for the maternal than for the offspring generation.

TI  - Multiple Adaptive Strategies of Himalayan Iodobacter sp. PCH194 to High-Altitude Stresses
VL  - 13
AB  - Bacterial adaption to the multiple stressed environments of high-altitude niches in the Himalayas is intriguing and is of considerable interest to biotechnologists. Previously, we studied the culturable and unculturable metagenome microbial diversity from glacial and kettle lakes in the Western Himalayas. In this study, we explored the adaptive strategies of a unique Himalayan eurypsychrophile Iodobacter sp. PCH194, which can synthesize polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and violacein pigment. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of Iodobacter sp. PCH194 (4.58 Mb chromosome and three plasmids) revealed genetic traits associated with adaptive strategies for cold/freeze, nutritional fluctuation, defense against UV, acidic pH, and the kettle lake's competitive environment. Differential proteome analysis suggested the adaptive role of chaperones, ribonucleases, secretion systems, and antifreeze proteins under cold stress. Antifreeze activity inhibiting the ice recrystallization at -9 degrees C demonstrated the bacterium's survival at subzero temperature. The bacterium stores carbon in the form of PHB under stress conditions responding to nutritional fluctuations. However, violacein pigment protects the cells from UV radiation. Concisely, genomic, proteomic, and physiological studies revealed the multiple adaptive strategies of Himalayan Iodobacter to survive the high-altitude stresses.

VL  - 17

SP  - 49-64
AB  - Maintaining the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services requires to take into consideration forest sensitivity and adaptability to a changing environment. In this context, dynamic models are indispensable to assess the combined effects of management and climate change on forest dynamics. We evaluated the importance of implementing different approaches for simulating forest management in the climate-sensitive gap model ForClim and compared its outputs with forest inventory data at multiple sites across the European Alps. The model was then used to study forest dynamics in representative silver fir-European beech stands in the Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia) under current management and different climate scenarios. On average, ForClim accurately predicted the development of basal area and stem numbers, but the type of harvesting algorithm used and the information for stand initialization are key elements that must be defined carefully. Empirical harvesting functions that rigorously impose the number and size of stems to remove fail to reproduce stand dynamics when growth is just slightly under- or overestimated, and thus should be substituted by analytical thinning algorithms that are based on stochastic distribution functions. Long-term simulations revealed that both management and climate change negatively impact conifer growth and regeneration. Under current climate, most of the simulated stands were dominated by European beech at the end of the simulation (i.e., 2150 AD), due to the decline of silver fir and Norway spruce caused mainly by harvesting. This trend was amplified under climate change as growth of European beech was favored by higher temperatures, in contrast to drought-induced growth reductions in both conifers. This forest development scenario is highly undesired by local managers who aim at preserving conifers with high economic value. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining a considerable share of conifers in these forests may not be feasible under climate change, especially at lower elevations where foresters should consider alternative management strategies.

AB  - Neutron capture therapy (NCT) aims at destroying tumoral cells selectively labeled by (10)boron. B-10 has a very high cross section for thermal neutron capture, and the nuclear reaction leads to the production of an alpha-particle and a Li-7 recoil ion, which carry an energy of 1.47 and 0.85 MeV, respectively. The radiobiological advantages lie in the production of high-LET particles inside the cell, leading to a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the irradiation. Despite a first failure during the 50's in the U.S.A., the long survivals obtained by H. Hatanaka for high grade gliomas have led to a renewal of the research and of the clinical trials. Hatanaka's clinical results have been confirmed since then by those of Y. Mishima on melanoma. This paper focuses on the present status of the research and of the clinical trials of NCT, on the progress in boronated molecules and in neutron sources, and finally on the tumoral localization which could potentially benefit of this technique.

VL  - 138
IS  - 6
SP  - 1141-1152
AB  - Seasonal dynamics of feeding activity, oil sac volume, gonad development, sex ratio and spawning periods in the two sibling species Calanus finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus, the key zooplankton copepod organisms throughout the northern Atlantic waters, were studied simultaneously in Malangen, northern Norway, during 1992. We were also tracing differences in surface and deep-dwelling components of these populations in terms of oil sac volume and gonad development during the time period when the G(1) is preparing for a subsequent generation (G(2)) Or hibernation. The main difference in the life cycle strategies of these species is the earlier maturation and spawning of C. hyperboreus. No feeding activity in either of the two species was found in February, but both commenced feeding in March, prior to the spring phytoplankton peak. The larger copepod, C. hyperboreus, had a more intensive energy deposition than C. finmarchicus. The period of active feeding was much shorter for the former species, only from March through July in copepodite stages CIV and CV, and even less in females - March and April. Basically, a similar pattern of seasonal changes in gonad length and lipids was observed in the two species. In June, oil sacs in the surface- and deep-dwelling specimens were about equal, during the rest of the year, lipids in the deep CVs exceeded those in the surface. We propose that as copepods accumulated sufficient lipid reserves, they started to descend, while others, containing less fat, stayed in the upper layers feeding. The mean length of the gonads in the surface-dwelling copepods was consistently less than in their deep counterparts from October to February, so that gonad development at the expense of accumulated reserves during resting stage was cofirmed. C. finmarchicus males were found in considerable numbers only in February and March, and were only occasionally found in the upper layers (0 100 m), while adult male C. hyperboreus were present from October to March, but were never found in the surface layers. The differences in life cycle timing among the two species are discussed in relation to tradeoffs with regard to foraging strategies, generation numbers, bioenergetics and predator avoidance.

Charr (20-27 cm), previously reared in freshwater under natural photoperiod, were transferred either directly (DT) from freshwater to seawater (35 ppt), from freshwater to brackish water (20 ppt), or were gradually adapted (GT) to seawater over a period of 10 days. Control fish were held in freshwater. Feed intake and osmoregulatory ability were then monitored on three occasions during the following 59 days. Two experiments were carried out, one during winter (December-January) and the other during summer (June-July). In both experiments fish mortality was low. Plasma osmolalities recorded in fish transferred to seawater were within normal ranges, but osmolalities on day 10, were significantly lower in summer (313 mOsm/kg (DT), 328 mOsm/kg (GT)) than in winter (323 mOsm/kg (DT), 352 mOsm/kg (GT)). In winter, feed intake and growth rates were high in fish kept in fresh and brackish water, but charr transferred directly to seawater ate little and lost weight. Fish that were gradually adapted to seawater occupied an intermediate position. During summer the observed differences in feed intake were small and all fish had relatively high growth rates. These results suggest that Arctic charr display seasonal changes in feed intake and growth performance that parallel seasonal changes in hypoosmoregulatory capacity. The ability to survive and hypoosmoregulate in full strength seawater does not, however, seem to be a particularly good indicator of successful seawater adaptation with respect to the ability to display high rates of feed intake and growth. During winter, a gradual transfer to seawater appeared to lead to improved feeding and growth compared to direct transfer.

TI  - Young wrinkle ridges in Mare Imbrium: Evidence for very recent compressional tectonism
VL  - 329
SP  - 24-33
AB  - Wrinkle ridges are common landforms widely distributed in the lunar maria, Many young wrinkle ridges were found inside Mare Imbrium using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) high-resolution images. They represent very recent tectonic activity on the lunar surface. Determining their formation times and morphology is important in understanding the Moon's late evolution. The young ridges were mapped, and they have a winding and arched morphology. Based on their small scale and crisp appearance, crosscutting relations with very young small craters whose youth was concluded from spatial boulder densities within their ejecta blankets, these young wrinkle ridges were estimated to be as young as 10 or a few 10s of Ma, and may still be active today. The young ridges were mainly distributed in the inner region of Imbrium basin, which may suggest that the thermal and structural evolution of the inside area of Imbrium basin was protracted.

TI  - A Mathematical Model for Thin-Layer Drying of Litchi Pulp
VL  - 192
SP  - 51-+
AB  - A drying experiment of litchi pulp was done with a self-built heat-pump drying system. A few commonly-used thin-layer drying models for foods were linearized and fitted with the drying experimental data to select a relatively optimal model of depicting the relationship between moisture ratio and drying time of the heat-pump drying of litchi pulp. It was found that the Page model is relatively optimal. The multivariate linear regression approach was employed to solve for the parameters of the Page model based on experimental data and an experimental verification was conducted; the verification results show that the predicted values of the Page model have a good fitness with the measured values and thus the Page model can predict more accurately the moisture ratio and drying rate of litchi pulp in a heat-pump drying process.

TI  - Impact of climate and drought events on the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) provenances
VL  - 307
SP  - 30-42
AB  - We explored the growth response of Scots pine to temperature, precipitation, and drought focusing on eleven provenances from the IUFRO 1982 international provenance trial. At two macroclimatically different sites in Germany we measured chronologies of tree-ring widths and annual height increment. We estimated general climate/growth relationships and examined the growth response, based on tolerance indices of resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience, to the most severe drought event per site. Using multivariate benchmarking of provenance archetypes, we established a ranking of the individual provenances in terms of general performance. In addition to considerable differences in overall growth between provenances, growth metrics differed between sites which were mostly attributable to climate. Basal area increment depended mainly on water availability from May to July, whereas annual height growth was influenced by moisture deficit during May of the current year. The reaction to drought events was shown to depend on the timing and duration of the drought event. Differences between provenances in resistance were modest, but more pronounced for recovery and especially for resilience and relative resilience. The results indicate a better adaptation to drought of the provenance from Bosnia Herzegovina and of local German provenances compared to other provenances. We summarized the findings by aligning the eleven provenances between two multivariately defined archetypes, one of which represented best general performance defined by good overall growth, low climate sensitivity and high resilience to drought. This approach confirmed the superior performance of the local German populations. Provenances from France and Poland were ranked above average whereas northern provenances and that from Bosnia Herzegovina were found to be least suitable at the sites under investigation. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of considering provenance in the discussion about future adaptedness and adaptability of tree species under climate change scenarios.

TI  - Assisted migration is plausible for a boreal tree species under climate change: A quantitative and population genetics study of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in western Canada
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - A novel method was tested for improving tree breeding strategies that integrate quantitative and population genetics based on range-wide reciprocal transplant experiments. Five reciprocal common garden tests of Populus tremuloides were investigated including 6450 trees across western Canada focusing on adaptation traits and growth. Both genetic parameters and home-site transplant models were evaluated. We found a genetic trade-off between growth and early spring leaf flush and late fall senescence. Coefficients of phenotypic variation (CVp) of cell lysis (CL), a measure of freezing injury, shrank from 0.28 to 0.10 during acclimation in the fall, and the CVp slope versus the freezing temperature was significantly different from zero (R-2 = 0.33, p = .02). There was more between-population genetic variation in fall phenology than in spring leaf phenology. We suggest that P. tremuloides demonstrated a discrepancy between the ecological optimum and the physiological optimum minimum winter temperature. The sub-optimal growing condition of P. tremuloides is potentially caused by the warmer ecological optimum than the physiological optimum. Assisted migration and breeding of fast growers to reforest cooler plantation sites can improve productivity. Transferring the study populations to less than 4 degrees C of extreme minimum temperature appears safe for reforestation aligning with the historical recolonization direction of the species. This is equivalent to a 5-10 degrees latitudinal northward movement. Fall frost hardiness is an effective criterion for family selection in the range tested in this study.

TI  - The Impacts of Warming Temperatures on US Sorghum Yields and the Potential for AdaptationJEL codes
VL  - 103
IS  - 5
SP  - 1742-1758
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that climate change will have significant negative effects on agricultural productivity across many highly concentrated production regions. Much empirical analysis has begun to focus on both short- and long-run adaptation within these regions. US sorghum production has received relatively less attention than other commonly grown grains, such as corn and wheat, despite that it is one of the top five grains grown in the US and ranks in the top ten of all crops grown globally. We match farm-level yield outcomes with fine-scale gridded weather data to generate a panel of Kansas sorghum producers totaling 45,971 observations spread across 7,298 farms and thirty-eight years. Fixed effects regressions leverage substantial cross-sectional and temporal variation in yields and weather to estimate the effect of warming temperatures on yields. Results suggest that sorghum is quite sensitive to warming temperatures-as moderate increases of 2 degrees C in growing season temperatures lead to an average 24% reduction in yields-thereby raising doubts about its potential for offsetting climate change impacts relative to other crops. We also consider whether warming impacts can be lessened through growing season adjustments and find very little support for this form of adaptation. A cross-sectional identification approach that encapsulates additional forms of adaptation also finds limited adaptation potential for sorghum producers. As a possible upside, we find evidence that sorghum's ability to withstand extreme heat has decreased by 70% over time, suggesting that there might exist currently outdated production practices and/or seed varieties that could help offset warming impacts.

AB  - The sawfly, Cephalcia arvensis Panzer, is a pest of the Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and has caused large outbreaks in Europe. The variability in the diapause length and the adaptability of the immature stages to a wide range of temperatures makes it difficult to predict the attacks and the phenology. In this paper, the effects of variable temperature regimes on both embryonic and larval development are studied in a natural environment. The experimental conditions covered the whole temperature range of the areas colonized by the pest. Several models were considered and their estimation were performed using the DEVAR software program applied to natural fluctuating temperatures. Before the application of DEVAR, its predictive power was tested using hypothetical data sets. The program was able to find parameter values leading to an excellent model fit. Four models were validated using data from three generations of natural populations of the pest. All models gave a good prediction for both embryos and larvae in all the years considered. The model can be usefully applied in population dynamics and in timing the application of both insecticides and entomopathogenic nematodes against the pest.

AB  - The duration of development of Catolaccus grandis (Burks) (parasitoid of the cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman) was determined at seven constant temperatures. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to test the fit of temperature-dependent developmental rates to the poikilotherm and Logan models. The mean total developmental time of C. grandis was significantly shorter in males than in females. The females completed development in 38.2, 22.5, 18.7, 15.0, 13.3, and 11.8 d from egg to emergence at 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33-degrees-C. Development in males required 32.2, 18.0, 15.3, 13.0, 11.8, and 11.1 d from egg to adult at the same respective temperatures. All individuals were unable to complete development at 36-degrees-C, but they developed successfully to the fifth instar at this temperature. No evidence of development was observed at 39-degrees-C. The three models tested fitted the data similarly well; however, the Logan 1 model is recommended over Logan 2 because of its simplicity. Developmental rates of the boll weevil and the native parasitoid Bracon mellitor Say are compared with those observed on C. grandis. Implications on the adaptability of C. grandis to the South Texas environment are discussed.

VL  - 66
SP  - 10-15
AB  - Atmospheric and room temperature plasma and adaptive evolution were combined to generate Escherichia coli mutants, which can simultaneously and efficiently utilize glucose and xylose to produce succinic acid in chemically defined medium under exclusively anaerobic condition. Compared to the parent strain BA305, a pflB, ldhA, ppc, and ptsG deletion strain overexpressing ATP-forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (PEPCK), the sugar consumption rate and succinic acid productivity of mutant BA408 were significantly improved with a marked increase in the key enzyme activities. Subsequent anaerobic fermentation of BA408 with corn stalk hydrolysate produced a final succinic acid concentration of 23.1 g L-1 with a yield of 0.85 g g(-1) sugar mixture. The observed synthesis of succinic acid from the corn stalk hydrolysate showed a great potential usage of renewable biomass as a feedstock for an economical succinic acid production using E. coli.

VL  - 67
IS  - 3
SP  - 809-822
AB  - The post spawning behaviour of sea trout Salmo irutia was studied over a 2 year period in the river and estuary of the River Fowey, south-west England. Forty-five sea trout kelts were trapped immediately after spawning in December and intraperitoneally tagged with miniature acoustic transmitters. The subsequent emigration into coastal waters was monitored using acoustic receivers deployed throughout the river catchment. The levels of gill Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity in sea trout kelts sampled at the same time as the tagged fish were within the range of 2.5 to 4.5 mu mol Pi per mg protein per h indicating that the post-spawning fish were not physiologically adapted to salt water. The tagged kelts were resident in fresh water between 4 and 70 days before entering the estuary. Sixty two per cent of the tagged kelts subsequently migrated successfully into coastal waters, with a higher success rate for male fish (75%) than females (58%). There was a significant size related difference in the run-timing of the kelts with the larger fish moving more quickly into coastal waters after spawning than smaller fish. Seaward migration within fresh water was predominantly nocturnal and generally occurred in conjunction with increasing river discharge and rising water temperature. Migration through the estuary continued to be predominantly nocturnal and occurred during an ebbing tide. Residency within the estuary varied amongst individuals although it was invariably short, with most fish moving out into coastal waters within one to two tidal cycles. Five tagged kelts returned from the coastal zone and re-entered fresh water during April and June. Marine residence time varied between 89 and 145 days (mean 118 days) and the minimum estimated marine survival was c. 18%. One of these sea trout was subsequently recaptured after successfully spawning in the vicinity where it had been previously tagged demonstrating a degree of spawning site fidelity.

TI  - Effects of Food Changes on Intestinal Bacterial Diversity of Wintering Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha)
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
AB  - Simple Summary The intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in the health of animals, and food is an important factor that influences the intestinal microbial community. During the winter months, waterbirds require certain foods to supply them with energy through the cold winter. Due to changes in the plant resources available to waterbirds, their intestinal bacteria will vary accordingly. In this study, we analysed the relationship between food composition and intestinal bacteria in hooded cranes (Grus monacha). We found that food resources from similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The results show that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes had a certain adaptability to the type of food being consumed. This study contributes novel insights into the diet of hooded cranes in the winter months, allowing for improved protection and management strategies. As food is recognised as an important factor affecting the intestinal microbiota, seasonal changes in diet can influence the community composition. The hooded crane (Grus monacha) is an endangered migratory waterbird species, with some of the population wintering in the sallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain. Their food resources have changed seasonally, with a reduction resulting from wetland degradation. To cope with seasonal changes in food availability, hooded cranes must constantly adjust their foraging strategies to survive. We studied the effect of changes in diet on the intestinal bacterial diversity of hooded cranes at Shengjin Lake, using faecal microanalysis and high-throughput sequencing. The results show that the main foods of hooded cranes were Polygonum criopolitanum, Oryza sativa, and Carex spp., which were significantly related to the composition of the intestinal bacterial community. In addition, foods available from the similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidipiscis in January and March was significantly higher than in November. Our research shows that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes actively adapt to diet changes to overcome the negative impact of the reduction in food resources, which is vital to the survival of hooded cranes.

TI  - Impact of climate change on farms in smallholder farming systems: Yield impacts, economic implications and distributional effects
VL  - 152
SP  - 58-66
AB  - The impact of climate change on farms can be determined by factors such as local climatic changes, farm physical environment, the type of crops grown, and household socio-economic characteristics that limit or increase adaptability to climate change. The current study assesses the impacts of climate and socio-economic changes on smallholder farms in two districts of Ethiopia representing different agro-ecology in a major agricultural region. For this purpose, observed farm production data, simulated yield under climate change and socio-economic scenarios were used. The aim was to produce information that facilitates an understanding of the unequal economic implications of climate change on farms. To this end, the study applied the Tradeoff Analysis for Multi-Dimensional impact assessment (TOA-MD) economic simulation model in combination with the AquaCrop yield simulation model. The findings on climate change impact towards 2030 highlight the uneven implications of climate change on farms and the role that agro-ecology and future solo-economic development scenarios play in determining climate change impact. It is found that, under the climate projections we considered crops such as tef, barley and wheat are found to benefit from the projected climate change in cool regions. In warm regions, tef and wheat are projected to be negatively affected whereas maize would benefit. The proportion of farms that are negatively affected by climate change ranged between 51% and 78% in warm regions under different scenarios; in cool regions, the proportion of negatively affected farms ranged between 10% and 22%. The implications of climate change are found to vary under various socio-economic scenarios, in which positive socio-economic scenarios considerably reduced the proportion of negatively affected farms. The economic implications of climate change also found to differ among farms within agro-ecology because of differences in land allocation to various crops that have different sensitivity to climate change, and due to other farm differences. Thus, the study shows the importance of using farm and site-specific production and climate data to reveal variabilities in climate change impact. It also provides evidence on the relevance of accounting for agro-ecology and crop differences as well as consideration of potential socio-economic changes. Overall, the results suggest that appropriate agricultural interventions that recognize location and crop differences are essential to minimize climate change impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Guess the impact of Ips typographus-An ecosystem modelling approach for simulating spruce bark beetle outbreaks
VL  - 166
SP  - 188-200
AB  - Spruce bark beetle outbreaks are common in Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics as a function of weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960-2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i.e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed.

TI  - Climate adaptation as mitigation: the case of agricultural investments
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Successful adaptation of agriculture to ongoing climate changes would help to maintain productivity growth and thereby reduce pressure to bring new lands into agriculture. In this paper we investigate the potential co-benefits of adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use, called SIMPLE, is utilized to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates, and land use emissions. A scenario of global adaptation to offset negative yield impacts of temperature and precipitation changes to 2050, which requires a cumulative 225 billion USD of additional investment, results in 61 Mha less conversion of cropland and 15 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) fewer emissions by 2050. Thus our estimates imply an annual mitigation co-benefit of 0 : 35 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) while spending $15 per tonne CO(2)e of avoided emissions. Uncertainty analysis is used to estimate a 5-95% confidence interval around these numbers of 0.25-0.43 Gt and $11-$22 per tonne CO(2)e. A scenario of adaptation focused only on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, while less costly in aggregate, results in much smaller mitigation potentials and higher per tonne costs. These results indicate that although investing in the least developed areas may be most desirable for the main objectives of adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant. Adaptation investments in high yielding, land scarce regions such as Asia and North America are more effective for mitigation. To identify data needs, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using the Morris method (Morris 1991 Technometrics 33 161-74). The three most critical parameters for improving estimates of mitigation potential are (in descending order) the emissions factors for converting land to agriculture, the price elasticity of land supply with respect to land rents, and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs. For assessing the mitigation costs, the elasticity of productivity with respect to investments in research and development is also very important. Overall, this study finds that broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are inexpensive relative to many activities whose main purpose is mitigation. These results therefore challenge the current approach of most climate financing portfolios, which support adaptation from funds completely separate from-and often much smaller than-mitigation ones.

TI  - On the prediction of short term changes in the recruitment of North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) using statistical temperature forecasts
VL  - 67
SP  - 211-218
AB  - Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis of a general relationship between sea temperature and recruitment of cod stocks across the North Atlantic, as well as between recruitment and the size of the spawning population. In the North Sea, cod year-class strength is inversely related to sea surface temperature during the first half of the year. This stock is currently at a low level, and the future trajectory of the stock biomass will be strongly influenced by recruitment levels. In the present study we investigate the possible use of observed and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) to increase the accuracy and/or time horizon of recruitment forecasts for this stock. We show that the statistical model developed for forecasting spring temperature has good skill (35% skill, with a standard error of 0.36degreesC) when predictions are made in late January. Within the frame of the current fish stock assessment working group we incorporate SST observations and January forecasts and simulate short-term recruitment projections. The resulting model accounts for a greater fraction of the variance in recruitment (42%) than that obtained without temperature (17%). In operational mode, the model allows forecasting 1.5 years in advance but the accuracy of predicted recruitment remains low. This example indicates that we have not yet reached a point where environmental information can be used with great benefit for the management of North Sea cod. However, a similar strategy may yield greater benefits if developed for other stocks for which environmental effects are better understood and/or account for a larger fraction of the variability in recruitment, for species with a shorter generation time and species for which recruitment forecast is critical to management (e.g. anchovy), and in areas where environmental prediction capabilities may be greater either in accuracy or in lead time.

AB  - We induced homozygous clones of amago salmon by gynogenetic chromosome manipulation. Mitotic gynogenesis diploid (mitotic-G2N) as first generation was produced by suppression of the first cleavage of the eggs inseminated with UV-irradiated sperm of rainbow trout by hydrostatic pressure shock. The yield of apparently normal gynogenetic embryos was 2.26% when the eggs were shocked at 650 kg/cm2 of hydrostatic pressure for 6 min at 5 h 30 min (approximately 68 h . degrees-C in cumulative temperature) after insemination. Homozygous evidence of gynogenetic juveniles was demonstrated by the segregation of Idh-3 and Pgm-1 loci. Five homozygous inbred strains were produced from the eggs of homozygous gynogenetic females by retaining the second polarbody, while outbred controls were produced for each strain by crossing with males of other strains. The clonal proof of these strains was demonstrated by the immunological acceptance of operculum allografts from inbred sisters. Similar survivals were shown among clones produced by mothers from identical strain. On the other hand, various survivals were seen between the clones using maternal parents from different strains. These results suggested that the line selection was a vital factor in clone production.

TI  - Potential mechanisms of attenuation for rifampicin-passaged strains of Flavobacterium psychrophilum
VL  - 15
AB  - Background: Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the etiologic agent of bacterial coldwater disease in salmonids. Earlier research showed that a rifampicin-passaged strain of F. psychrophilum (CSF 259-93B. 17) caused no disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum) while inducing a protective immune response against challenge with the virulent CSF 259-93 strain. We hypothesized that rifampicin passage leads to an accumulation of genomic mutations that, by chance, reduce virulence. To assess the pattern of phenotypic and genotypic changes associated with passage, we examined proteomic, LPS and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences for two F. psychrophilum strains (CSF 259-93 and THC 02-90) that were passaged with and without rifampicin selection. Results: Rifampicin resistance was conveyed by expected mutations in rpoB, although affecting different DNA bases depending on the strain. One rifampicin-passaged CSF 259-93 strain (CR) was attenuated (4 % mortality) in challenged fish, but only accumulated eight nonsynonymous SNPs compared to the parent strain. A CSF 259-93 strain passaged without rifampicin (CN) accumulated five nonsynonymous SNPs and was partially attenuated (28 % mortality) compared to the parent strain (54.5 % mortality). In contrast, there were no significant change in fish mortalities among THC 02-90 wild-type and passaged strains, despite numerous SNPs accumulated during passage with (n = 174) and without rifampicin (n = 126). While only three missense SNPs were associated with attenuation, a Ser492Phe rpoB mutation in the CR strain may contribute to further attenuation. All strains except CR retained a gliding motility phenotype. Few proteomic differences were observed by 2D SDS-PAGE and there were no apparent changes in LPS between strains. Comparative methylome analysis of two strains (CR and TR) identified no shared methylation motifs for these two strains. Conclusion: Multiple genomic changes arose during passage experiments with rifampicin selection pressure. Consistent with our hypothesis, unique strain-specific mutations were detected for the fully attenuated (CR), partially attenuated (CN) and another fully attenuated strain (B17).

SP  - 215-222
AB  - The objectives were to select for resistance to carbofuran in a susceptible field population of Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), assess the progression of resistance, and characterize the inheritance and possible mechanism of resistance. Initial selection in the field resulted in over 99.9 % mortality of treated larvae but high resistance in the survivors. Subsequent laboratory selection at c.80 % mortality increased resistance to > 100-fold by the fourth generation. Low level cross-resistance to azinphos-methyl was also present. Resistance appeared to be inherited via a single, autosomal, incompletely dominant gene, resulting in decreased acetylcholinesterase sensitivity. A second Michigan population also appeared to exhibit reduced cholinesterase sensitivity. Resistance to carbofuran in a Colorado potato beetle population from Long Island, NY appears to involve primarily mixed-function oxidase enzymes. The history of insecticide use probably affects which primary resistance mechanism appears in response to carbofuran treatment.

TI  - Strategies for integrating sexually propagated corals into Caribbean reef restoration: experimental results and considerations
VL  - 40
IS  - 5
SP  - 1667-1677
AB  - Caribbean hard coral cover has decreased by more than 80% in the last 40 years. In response, active coral restoration has grown in popularity as a management tool to sustain degraded reefs. To date, the majority of coral outplanting has employed asexually propagated ramets derived from wild donor colonies. Unfortunately, this strategy is incapable of increasing genetic diversity and limits the adaptive potential of restored coral populations. Methods for sexual propagation in land-based systems offer increasing potential to enhance genetic diversity of target species. However, questions regarding coral performance once placed back into the dynamic marine environment must be considered. Thus, focused experiments to optimize the integration of land reared corals and novel genetic diversity are of immense value. For this reason, we designed a study using two Acropora cervicornis year classes produced in a land-based system and concurrently relocated to an inshore patch reef, a back reef, and placed in an ocean-based nursery (n = 80 sexually propagated colonies per location). A deliberate monitoring strategy measured growth and survival five times over a 480-day period. Major findings were 1) high survival rates (similar to 73%) across all 160 outplanted colonies 2) significant differences in survival between outplanting locations and coral recruit year class, and 3) very high survival of sexually propagated corals relocated to the ocean-based nursery (similar to 93% overall), with 40-fold greater growth than direct-outplanted colonies. Our study suggests that ex situ sexual coral propagation offers a tractable tool to meet the need for increased A. cervicornis genetic diversity. Lastly, we offer insight and considerations for managing the high input of novel genotypes into restoration systems and suggest further research to maximize the adaptive potential of coral populations.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Statistical Downscaling Models for Monthly Precipitation
VL  - 18
AB  - Several statistical downscaling models have been developed in the past couple of decades to assess the hydrologic impacts of climate change by projecting the station-scale hydrological variables from large-scale atmospheric variables simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). This paper presents and compares different statistical downscaling models that use multiple linear regression (MLR), positive coefficient regression (PCR), stepwise regression (SR), and support vector machine (SVM) techniques for estimating monthly rainfall amounts in the state of Florida. Mean sea level pressure, air temperature, geopotential height, specific humidity, U wind, and V wind are used as the explanatory variables/predictors in the downscaling models. Data for these variables are obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis dataset and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CGCM3) GCM simulations. The principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means clustering method (FCM) are used as part of downscaling model to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the clusters in the data, respectively. Evaluation of the performances of the models using different error and statistical measures indicates that the SVM-based model performed better than all the other models in reproducing most monthly rainfall statistics at 18 sites. Output from the third-generation CGCM3 GCM for the A1B scenario was used for future projections. For the projection period 2001-10, MLR was used to relate variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales. Use of MLR in linking the predictor variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales yielded better reproduction of monthly rainfall statistics at most of the stations (12 out of 18) compared to those by spatial interpolation technique used in earlier studies.

TI  - Protein Gel's Phase Transition: Toward Superiorly Transparent and Hysteresis-Free Wearable Electronics
VL  - 30
IS  - 27
AB  - The next generation of wearable electronics for health monitoring, Internet-of-Things system, "interface-on-invisible," and green energy harvesting require electrically conductive material that is superiorly transparent, negligibly hysteretic, industrially feasible, and highly stretchable. The practical potential of ionic hydrogel is challenged with obvious hysteresis and a limited sensing range due to relative delamination and viscoelastic performance. Herein, a novel liquid conductor, termed as egg white liquid, is developed from self-liquidation of egg white hydrogel, and the liquid not only inherits the designed architecture from a hydrogel predecessor but also achieves comparable conductivity (20.4 S m(-1)) to the ionic hydrogel and ultrahigh transparency (up to 99.8%) . Moreover, the 3D-printed liquid-elastomer hybrid exhibits excellent conformability, remarkable sensitivity with negligible hysteresis (0.77%), and the capability of monitoring human motions and dynamic moduli is further demonstrated. The liquid nature inspires a gesture-controlled touchless user interface for front-end electronic systems. Furthermore, mechanical energy harvesting and pressure sensing are evidenced by exploiting this liquid conductor into a triboelectric nanogenerator. Notably, the as-prepared liquid via subsequent phase transition possessing superior transparency, ultralow hysteresis, economic benefit, and unique liquid phase may potentially fuel the development of a new class of wearable electronics, human-machine interface, and clean energy.

AB  - Despite the prevalence of high-stakes assessments-and the growing likelihood of heat exposure during such assessments-the effect of temperature on performance has not yet been studied in such settings. Using student-level administrative data for the largest public school district in the United States, I provide the first estimates of temperature's impact on high stakes exam performance and subsequent educational attainment. Hot temperature reduces performance by up to 13 percent of a standard deviation and leads to persistent impacts on high school graduation status, despite compensatory responses by teachers, who selectively upward manipulate grades after hotter exams.

VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 237-243
AB  - A novel psychrotolerant Psychrobacillus strain PB01, isolated from an Antarctic iceberg, was comparatively analyzed with five related strains. The complete genome of strain PB01 consists of a single circular chromosome (4.3 Mb) and a plasmid (19 Kb). As potential low-temperature adaptation strategies, strain PB01 has four genes encoding cold-shock proteins, two genes encoding DEAD-box RNA helicases, and eight genes encoding transporters for glycine betaine, which can serve as a cryoprotectant, on the genome. The pan-genome structure of the six Psychrobacillus strains suggests that strain PB01 might have evolved to adapt to extreme environments by changing its genome content to gain higher capacity for DNA repair, translation, and membrane transport. Notably, strain PB01 possesses a complete TCA cycle consisting of eight enzymes as well as three additional Helicobacter pylori-type enzymes: ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase, succinyl-CoA/acetoacetyl-CoA transferase, and malate/ quinone oxidoreductase. The co-existence of the genes for TCA cycle enzymes has also been identified in the other five Psychrobacillus strains.

VL  - 44

SP  - 67-73
AB  - Endangered freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera margaritifera reveal a complex life cycle with an obligate host-dependent phase. Only two species, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout S. trutta, are important hosts in Europe, indicating a high degree of specialization. Whilst freshwater pearl mussels with their filtering activity can provide important ecosystem services and indirectly improve the habitat quality for their salmonid hosts, their direct effects on physiological stress, reduced swimming performance, and increased mortality at high rates of infestation all support a parasitic character of the mussel during its host-dependent phase. From an evolutionary perspective, both the much greater generation time of the parasite compared to the host, as well as the great distribution ranges of M. margaritifera and its hosts should favour local adaptation patterns. The variable suitability of different salmonid strains and species as hosts for M. margaritifera and the resulting differences in the performance of larvae during the host-dependent phase indicate that host-management strategies should focus on maintaining high quality hosts at a regional scale to avoid selection or genetic drift effects which could erode the genetic and evolutionary potential for adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - It is well-known that camelina oil, obtained from Camelina sativa seeds is rich in fatty acids, predominantly linolenic acid and is used successfully in pharmaceutical and cosmetic therapies. It is remarkable that this species has a great adaptability to environmental conditions, being able to cultivate it on agricultural parcels and polluted soils. The goal of this work is to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative differences of three types of camelina oils, obtained from varieties grown in Romania: GP 202-Spanish provenance, Camelia and Madalina, both Romanian provenance. The effect of soil fertilization on the quality of the seeds /oil obtained from 3 varieties of camelina was tested, the control being the unfertilized Camelina variety. The following parameters have been evaluated: seed moisture, cold oil extraction yield, certain physico-chemical oil indicators and percent quantitative composition of individual and total fatty acids. Remarkable is the total fatty acid content of the oil that varies between 75.87 g% for the unfertilized Madalina variant and 81 g% for the fertilized GP-202 variant. Taking in consideration the results for all the studied parameters, it can be concluded that the Mack Vinci variety is very similar to the other two, and fertilization contributes insignificantly to the improvement of the quality of the obtained oil.

TI  - Potential modes of range shifts in euryhaline snails from the Baltic Sea and fresh water lakes in northern Germany
VL  - 811
IS  - 1
SP  - 339-350
AB  - The widely distributed snail species Theodoxus fluviatilis (Linneaus, 1758) is rather diverse in shell size and patterning. It has formed regional subgroups in northern Germany that appear separate in either fresh- or brackish water, yet, according to literature, are indistinguishable by morphology, anatomy or mtRNA markers. Tolerance towards challenging salinities, however, is distinct. The question as to whether the observed difference in salinity tolerance is a result of local adaptation or of phenotypic plasticity remains. In this study, physiological limits to salinity stress and tolerance shift abilities were compared between individuals from both subgroups in a salinity transfer experiment and acclimation regime followed by a survival analysis. Brackish water animals struggled in freshwater but performed much better than freshwater individuals when directly transferred into higher salinities. With acclimation to their challenging salinities, individuals of both subgroups achieved shifts in the slopes of their reaction norms and were able to survive salinity levels otherwise lethal to them. Even with this shift freshwater animals were not able reach the tolerance levels of brackish water individuals. The results indicate that phenotypic plasticity as well as genetic adaptation may determine osmotolerance in regional subgroups of T. fluviatilis.

TI  - Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) as energy crop in Central Italy: a review
VL  - 8
SP  - 10-17
AB  - In the European Union energy security have been driving the search for economically viable and environmentally sustainable renewable energy sources since the 90's. Energy crops could represent a good opportunity to combine the energy goals with the conservation of farmer incomes and the global climate change control. Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a perennial rhizomatous grass particularly attractive for energy production because of a high yield potential, a generally positive environmental impact and a good attitude to energy conversion. Long-term studies carried out in Central Italy confirmed its high production level, in both fertile and marginal lands (aboveground yields from 38 to 20 t ha(-1) year(-1)). In addition, the crop highlighted a high growth rate at the beginning of the growing season, progressively decreasing in summer when high temperature and low water availability occurred. Giant reed nutrient requirements were generally low and part of nutrient stocks were remobilized from the rhizome to the aboveground biomass over the spring, with the opposite flow occurring in autumn. From an environmental point of view giant reed showed a positive energy balance with a high-energy efficiency. Compared to other energy crops, giant reed showed the lowest GHG emissions per unit of energy and the best performance in terms of cost per ton of dry biomass or per unit of energy. To improve knowledge on giant reed and to favour the diffusion of energy crops in Italian cropping systems, further studies are needed to analyse the long-term effects of giant reed on soil fertility and the optimal soil management after its cultivation. In our researches the environmental impacts of giant reed and its production costs were referred to the production phase. Therefore, there is the need to extend the research activity to the whole energy chain and to identify the most sustainable conversion technologies (e.g. biogas, 2nd generation bioethanol, etc.) for the different environments.

VL  - 70
IS  - 3
SP  - 349-357
AB  - Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) enter seawater earlier and smaller (0.2 g) than any other salmonid following a two-stage salinity tolerance process initiated around yolk-sac absorption and completed with seawater entry. For the first time, this two-stage ontogeny of salinity tolerance was characterized by either holding posthatch pink salmon in fresh water or transferring them to seawater every 2 weeks. A window of salinity tolerance around yolk-sac absorption was evidenced by a period of zero morbidity in seawater compared with 100% morbidity for newly hatched alevins and 25% morbidity for fry (similar to 0.2-0.3 g). Increased hypo-osmoregulatory ability at the time of yolk-sac absorption was indicated in fish held in fresh water under constant photoperiod (12 h light : 12 h dark) and temperature (5 degrees C) by a switch from catabolic to anabolic growth, increased gill Na+K+-ATPase activity and alpha-1b/alpha-1a isoform expression, and a plateau in whole-body water content, implying that pink salmon go through a form of smoltification. A large increase in whole-body [Na+] observed in fresh water at yolk-sac absorption may represent a unique strategy for maintaining water balance once fish enter seawater.

In this study, we investigated the effect of sea temperature on habitat selection and habitat use of acoustically tagged Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. 3. Significant relationships between ocean temperature and habitat selection and use were found. Under favourable sea temperature thresholds (< 16 degrees C), cod selected vegetated habitats, such as eelgrass and macroalgae beds, available in shallow areas. Selection for those habitats was especially high at night, when cod tended to ascend to shallower areas, presumably to feed. Selection and use of those habitats decreased significantly as temperature rose. Under increased sea surface temperature conditions, cod were absent from vegetated shallow habitats, both during the day and night, and selected instead non-vegetated rocky bottoms and sand habitats, available in deeper, colder areas. 4. This study shows the dynamic nature of habitat selection and strongly suggests that cod in this region have to trade off food availability against favourable temperature conditions. Future increases in ocean temperature are expected to further influence the spatial behaviour of marine fish, potentially affecting individual fitness and population dynamics.

TI  - Sustainable intelligent buildings for people: A review
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
SP  - 67-86
AB  - Intelligent buildings need to be sustainable (i.e. sustain their performance for future generations), healthy and technologically up to date; meet regulatory demands; meet the needs of the occupants; and be flexible and adaptable enough to deal with change. Buildings will contain a variety of systems devised by many people, and yet the relationship between buildings and people can only work satisfactorily if there is integration between the supply- and demand-side stakeholders as well as between the occupants, the systems and the building. To achieve this, systems thinking is essential in planning, design and management, together with the ability to create and innovate while remaining practical (see Glossary). The ultimate objective should be simplicity rather than complexity. This requires not only technical ability but also the powers of interpretation, imagination and even intuition. Building Regulations can stifle creativity but are necessary to set a minimum level of expectation and obey health and safety requirements. However, we should aim at designing well above these conditions. After all, buildings form our architectural landscape and they, and the environment they generate, should uplift the soul and the spirit of those people within them as well as those who pass by them. The creation of shared visions, effective teams, clear structures and robust processes ensures that the intelligent building being constructed will demonstrate the purpose for which it was conceived. Times are changing as technology and society evolve, so there needs to be a long-term outlook by the team. Key innovation issues for intelligent buildings include sustainability (energy, water, waste and pollution), the use of information and communication technology, robotics, embedded sensor technology, smart-materials technology including nanotechnology, health in the workplace and social change. Smart materials in facades, for example, will provide sophisticated forms of feedback and high levels of control besides regulating thermal transmission. Eventually by coating and embedding materials with nanoparticles we will be able to specify material properties much more easily. Self-healing materials will revolutionize facades in the future. Pelletier and Bose (2010) describe how a concrete matrix embedded with capsules of sodium silicate healing agent can repair cracks by the sodium silicate from the ruptured capsules interacting with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to form a gel that seals the cracks. However, innovation must be an enabler rather than an end in itself. Passive environmental design is equally important so that the energy demands are minimized by using natural means such as mass, orientation and building form to capture sunlight, fresh air and rain water. The intelligent buildings control markets are strong worldwide even after the gloomy economic period of 2009. The largest markets are in the USA, Asia, Middle East and Europe but some smaller countries are showing rapid growth. BSRIA Member e-News August 2009 shows that Scandinavia, Germany and Qatar spend most per capita on sophisticated intelligent controls. The increasing demand for sustainable, healthy and low-carbon intelligent buildings seems likely to sustain this dynamic market. Building management systems (BMSs) provide control and interoperability between the various systems servicing the building. Innovations such as internet-based, common, open communication standards and protocols increasingly make it more important to integrate the systems within intelligent buildings. This in turn will require an extended range of professional expertise that could force a cultural change. A key driver is the sustainability agenda. This article is about the actions and trends that are necessary to achieve a sustainable intelligent building. Such buildings need intelligent infrastructures and serve communities that demand new master planning approaches, and these will feature in a later special issue.

AB  - Glass vial laboratory bioassays were used to evaluate sensitivities of a laboratory strain and a malathion-resistant field strain of the parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to two pyrethroids, deltamethrin and cyfluthrin. Knockdown (24 h) and mortality (48 h) dose response data for the parasitoids were compared with those of laboratory and field strains of the parasitoid's host, the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). For both species, higher doses were required for mortality than for knockdown. LD50s for 48 h mortality for the field strain of A. calandrae were 0.36 mug/vial for deltamethrin and 1.52 mug/vial for cyfluthrin. The malathion-resistant field strain of A. calandrae was about 2-fold more resistant to the pyrethroids compared with the laboratory strain. LD50s for the field strain of S. oryzae were 0.51 mug/vial for deltamethrin and 1.51 mug/vial for cyfluthrin. There no significant differences in response of the laboratory and field strains of S. oryzae to the pyrethroids. Although they are not currently labelled for use as grain protectants, these pyrethroids offer several advantages over organophosphorothioates in controlling stored grain insects. However, resistance ratios in A. calandrae will have to be increased, probably through laboratory selection procedures, to allow this parasitoid to be used in a pest management program in combination with these compounds.

TI  - High Organic Burial Efficiency Is Required to Explain Mass Balance in Earth's Early Carbon Cycle
VL  - 35
IS  - 2
AB  - Earth's carbon cycle maintains a stable climate and biosphere on geological timescales. Feedbacks regulate the size of the surface carbon reservoir, and on million-year timescales the carbon cycle must be in steady state. A major question about the early Earth is whether carbon was cycled through the surface reservoir more quickly or slowly than it is today. The answer to this question holds important implications for Earth's climate state, the size of the biosphere through time, and the expression of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth-like planets. Here, we examine total carbon inputs and outputs from the Earth's surface over time. We find stark disagreement between the canonical histories of carbon outgassing and carbon burial, with the former implying high rates of throughput on the early Earth and the latter suggesting sluggish carbon cycling. We consider solutions to this apparent paradox and conclude that the most likely resolution is that high organic burial efficiency in the Precambrian enabled substantial carbon burial despite limited biological productivity. We then consider this model in terms of Archean redox balance and find that in order to maintain atmospheric anoxia prior to the Great Oxidation Event, high burial efficiency likely needed to be accompanied by greater outgassing of reductants. Similar mechanisms likely govern carbon burial and redox balance on terrestrial exoplanets, suggesting that outgassing rates and the redox state of volcanic gases likely play a critical role in setting the tempo of planetary oxygenation.

AB  - The tight sandstone reservoir of Chang 6(3) Formation of Huaqing Area in Ordos Basin were divided into three types based on its different pore types: formation with intergranular pore type, dissolved-intercrystalline pore type and pore plus fracture type reservoirs, which were dominated by casting thin sections, scanning electron microscope(SEM), granularity image, high-pressure mercury injection, constant-rate mercury injection, nuclear magnetic resonance and real sandstone micro model experiment, and the porosity evolution path in each type were studied. The study shows that: The physical property, pore structure, and type of displacement in each reservoir type have obvious differences, which indicate that the reservoir classification evaluation which is based on pore assembly type has its own applicability in research region. Combined with parameters such as buried depth and temperature, the porosity evolution path has apparent control on pore structure. The porosity evolution of reservoirs with different pore types reveals the effect of increased and decreased porosity on the reservoir's quality. Pore structures have close relationship with productivity law.

VL  - 53

SP  - 1308-1321
AB  - The Lower Cretaceous shales of Chagan Sag, Yingen-Ejinaqi Basin, are considered as the source rocks of hydrocarbons discovered in the sag. Borehole shales from the Lower Cretaceous were subjected to comprehensive geochemical study to evaluate the quality of source rock, to reconstruct the paleodepositional environment and to determine the controlling factors of organic matter enrichment. Content of present-day total organic carbon, and hydrogen index, averaging 1.4% and 259.2mg hydrocarbon/g total organic carbon, respectively reveal poor to fair quality of organic matter. Average value of vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of 1.0% indicates mature organic matter. Maceral composition and biomarker analysis provide evidence for a mixed aquatic and terrigeous organic matter input. Based on Sr/Cu, Sr/Ba, and gammacerane index, we propose that organic matter was deposited in closed hypersaline under hot and arid climate conditions. The ratios of V/(V+Ni), and pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph), as well as the presence of -carotene suggest a stratified water column with anoxic bottom water condition. Low to moderate productivity as a result of deficient nutrient supply, the excellent organic matter preservation condition under stratified anoxic water column and high sedimentary rate controlled the quality of source rock. In addition, influence of factors such as content of clay minerals on organic matter enrichment cannot be ignored.

VL  - 298
AB  - Exergy analysis is powerful tool for process optimization and mechanism analysis. In this study, exergy analysis was performed for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fermentation process. More than 86% of input exergy was contributed by glucose. The exergy of biomass was about 64.66% of the total output exergy when the phosphate concentration was 4 g L-1. The exergy efficiencies of DHA (eta(DHA)) for the starting strains and the evolved strains under high oxygen concentration, low temperature, and two-factor conditions were also investigated. The eta(DHA) in the collected experimental data was not more than 20.9%. It was proved that there was a positive correlation between eta DHA and the biomass yield. It was indicated that adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) improved biomass yield which had the most important effect on enhancing eta DHA and DHA yield (or DHA productivity). It is necessary to improve eta DHA through process optimization and ALE in future.

TI  - Relocated beaver can increase water storage and decrease stream temperature in headwater streams
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
AB  - Many areas are experiencing increasing stream temperatures due to climate change, and some are experiencing reduced summer stream flows and water availability. Because dam building and pond formation by beaver can increase water storage, stream cooling, and riparian ecosystem resilience, beaver have been proposed as a potential climate adaption tool. Despite the large number of studies that have evaluated how beaver activity may affect hydrology and water temperature, few experimental studies have quantified these outcomes following beaver relocation. We evaluated changes in temperature and water storage following the relocation of 69 beaver into 13 headwater stream reaches of the Skykomish River watershed within the Snohomish River basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated how beaver dams affected surface and groundwater storage and stream temperature. Successful relocations created 243 m(3) of surface water storage per 100 m of stream in the first year following relocation. Dams raised water table elevations by up to 0.33 m and stored approximately 2.4 times as much groundwater as surface water per relocation reach. Stream reaches downstream of dams exhibited an average decrease of 2.3 degrees C during summer base-flow conditions. We also assessed how dam age, condition, maintenance frequency, and pond morphology influenced stream temperature at naturally colonized wetland complexes. Our findings demonstrate that dam building can increase water storage and reduce stream temperatures in the first year following successful beaver relocation. Fluvial and floodplain morphology of candidate reaches for relocation is an important consideration because it determines the type and magnitude of response. Relocation to reaches with existing small, abandoned ponds may address thermal criteria by conversion from warming to cooling reaches, whereas relocation within large, abandoned complexes or vacant habitat may result in greater water storage. Although beaver relocation can be an effective climate adaptation strategy to retain more stable hydrologic regimes and water quality in our study area, there appear to be regionally specific environmental and geomorphic factors that influence how beaver affect water storage and temperature. More research is needed to investigate how and why these regional differences affect water storage and stream temperature response in beaver-influenced systems.

TI  - Sex reversal explains some, but not all, climate-mediated sex ratio variation within a viviparous reptile
VL  - 289
IS  - 1976
AB  - Evolutionary transitions in sex-determining systems have occurred frequently yet understanding how they occur remains a major challenge. In reptiles, transitions from genetic to temperature-dependent sex determination can occur if the gene products that determine sex evolve thermal sensitivity, resulting in sex-reversed individuals. However, evidence of sex reversal is limited to oviparous reptiles. Here we used thermal experiments to test whether sex reversal is responsible for differences in sex determination in a viviparous reptile, Carinascincus ocellatus, a species with XY sex chromosomes and population-specific sex ratio response to temperature. We show that sex reversal is occurring and that its frequency is related to temperature. Sex reversal was unidirectional (phenotypic males with XX genotype) and observed in both high- and low-elevation populations. We propose that XX-biased genotypic sex ratios could produce either male- or female-biased phenotypic sex ratios as observed in low-elevation C. ocellatus under variable rates of XX sex reversal. We discuss reasons why sex reversal may not influence sex ratios at high elevation. Our results suggest that the mechanism responsible for evolutionary transitions from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination is more complex than can be explained by a single process such as sex reversal.

VL  - 27
IS  - 4
SP  - 746-762
AB  - Lack of natural disturbance in many forests in northeastern North America has resulted in increased canopy cover and a reduction of open-habitat patches. Crotalus horridus (Timber Rattlesnake) in this region depends upon open basking and gestation sites, and its populations have declined markedly. We evaluated the utility of mechanical tree removal to restore potential basking habitat for a highly imperiled Timber Rattlesnake population in New Hampshire. We used a before-after, control-impact study to test for the effects of tree removal on environmental temperature and Timber Rattlesnake and other wildlife use of 3 potential basking sites. Mean temperatures were significantly higher and more variable post-treatment, while minimum temperatures were relatively unaffected. The number of temperature readings within the span of selected body temperatures of gravid female Timber Rattlesnakes (25.2-31.7 degrees C) increased post-treatment. Using time-lapse cameras, we detected rattlesnakes during 5 days at post-treatment sites but on only 1 day at a control site. Detections of potential rattlesnake prey species did not change following treatment, and few potential rattlesnake predators were detected pre- or post-treatment. Our results suggest that tree removal around potential basking sites likely improves thermal habitat quality for Timber Rattlesnakes.

TI  - Utilization of distillery stillage for energy generation and concurrent production of valuable microalgal biomass in the sequence: biogas-cogeneration-microalgae-products
VL  - 51
IS  - 3
SP  - 606-611
AB  - The aim of the study was the experimental verification of a proposed novel technology of energy and materials production, consisting of the following process steps: production of biogas from agricultural waste (distillery stillage), presumed utilization of biogas for electricity and heat production (cogeneration) in association with its use as a source of carbon dioxide for microalgae cultivation. The microalgal biomass can be hereafter processed to valuable products such as food and feed supplements. A part of the process wastewater can be utilized as a nitrogen source (ammonium ions) for microalgae cultivation, so the whole process is technologically closed. The tests were performed in a pilot-scale device. Optimization of biogas production from distillery stillage is described. The growth kinetics of microalgae Chlorella sp. consuming biogas or mixture of air and carbon dioxide in the concentration range of 2-20% (v/v) (simulating a flue gas from biogas incineration) in laboratory-scale photo-bioreactors are presented. It was proven that the raw biogas (even without the removal of hydrogen sulphide) could be used as a source of carbon dioxide for growth of microalgae. The growth rate of microalgae consuming biogas was the same as the growth rate of the culture grown on a mixture of air and food-grade carbon dioxide. Using biogas as a source of carbon dioxide has two main advantages: the biomass production costs are reduced and the produced biomass does not contain harmful compounds, which can occur in flue gases. The microalgal growth in bubbled cylinders was typically linear with time. The growth rate dependence on the diameter of the photobioreactor can be correlated using an empirical formula M = 2.2 D(-0.8) (valid for the linear bubbling velocities in the range of w = 0.1-0.3 cm/s), where M is the growth rate in g/L/h, and D is the photobioreactor diameter in mm. Processing of the fermenter wastewater was also quantified. Particularly the removal of ammonia via distillation of the previously alkalized digested sludge was investigated. The possible reuse of ammonia as a fertilizer or as a nitrogen source for microalgae cultivation was examined. About 10% of the distillate (free ammonia concentration up to 20 g/L) can be utilized. The process can be economically viable if a suitable photobioreactor is chosen and the electricity, microalgal biomass and the fertilizer production are valued. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - No-till farming: The way of the future for a sustainable dryland agriculture
VL  - 36
IS  - 3
SP  - 193-208
AB  - Most dryland fanning systems depend an tillage to grow crops. There is overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution, intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases, soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability. These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems during the transition are temporary and become less important as the no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop rotations, cover crops and same soil disturbance may help reduce agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to provide strategies far promoting no-till as a way to enhance agricultural sustainability for future generations.
